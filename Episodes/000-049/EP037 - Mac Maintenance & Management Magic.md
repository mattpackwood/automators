| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00:00      | Hello, my name is Rosemary Orchard, and I am joined today by my wonderful co-host,                      |
| 00:07      | David Sparks, and we are going to talk about automation. Hello, David.                                    |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rosemary. How are you today?                                                                     |
| 00:13      | I am excited. We're talking about the Mac today.                                                        |
| 00:16      | Yes, we are automating the Mac and all the maintenance tasks you do.                                    |
| 00:22      | People need to maintain their Macs, but that doesn't mean you need to manually do that, right?          |
| 00:27      | Oh, God, no. I mean, why would I spend all this time, you know, like,                                   |
| 00:30      | clearing my trash and removing old files from downloads and stuff like that,                            |
| 00:34      | when actually I can just get a couple of tools to do all this stuff for me,                             |
| 00:39      | or at the very least make it into something that I can do in a couple of clicks.                        |
| 00:43      | Yeah. Well, we're going to talk about that today, and I'm looking forward to getting started.           |
| 00:49      | Why don't we just dig right in?                                                                         |
| 00:51      | Yeah. I mean, I think maybe we should start at the end in many ways with maybe the trash,               |
| 00:57      | because there's quite a few ways that you can automate clearing out your trash and just cleaning        |
| 01:01      | up in general, which is perhaps the end of what you do at the end of the day, rather.                   |
| 01:07      | But I feel that that's a good place to start, because that's one of the easiest things to               |
| 01:10      | accomplish, in my opinion. Yeah. One of the things that people have lost track of is                    |
| 01:16      | the Mac maintenance tools made by Apple, and they're there, but they're not necessarily                 |
| 01:23      | where you think they are. One of the places you go to it is the Apple menu about this Mac,              |
| 01:31      | and if you go there, you'll see that they've got a bunch of information in that. You know,              |
| 01:35      | they've got information about your displays, your storage, showing, you know, what's going on with      |
| 01:40      | what's stored on your hard drive. They've also got, if you've got Apple care attached or support        |
| 01:46      | or service stuff attached, you've got that information there. But if you go to the manage               |
| 01:51      | button for your drive under storage, that opens a whole bunch of options. And one of the ones           |
| 01:59      | that it opens is the ability to empty your trash automatically. This has not been there forever.        |
| 02:05      | I kind of lost track, but it's been within the last three or four years, I would say,                   |
| 02:09      | that they've added this. It's definitely on Mac OS Mojave, because I'm still running that.              |
| 02:13      | I'm still a little nervous about upgrading to Catalina on my recording machines,                        |
| 02:17      | and I've just double checked, and it's right there in Mojave. Yeah. So if you want to, I mean,          |
| 02:23      | because your trash does fill up, and that is a problem if you've got limited storage space,             |
| 02:31      | and the age of SSDs has made that an issue for everybody. I mean, you do need to be                     |
| 02:36      | keeping an eye on what's getting stored in your hard drive, because I call it a hard drive,             |
| 02:42      | it's not even a hard drive anymore, your drive, because with the limited number of bits you've          |
| 02:48      | got on the solid state storage, given the cost of them, although that is getting better now,            |
| 02:54      | you do need to be aware of that, and you can do it right out of the operating system. So just           |
| 02:59      | go into About This Mac over to the Storage tab and tap the Manage button. Can you see why nobody        |
| 03:07      | notices there, Rose? First of all, who would think that in order to manage the automatically            |
| 03:13      | emptying the trash, you'd go to the About This Mac button under the Apple menu? How would you           |
| 03:17      | even know to look there? But that's there, and that's really nice. So I would recommend, if nothing,    |
| 03:25      | just put that in there. But there's also some software tools for this as well.                          |
| 03:28      | Yeah. So one of the tools that I really like to use for this is [[Hazel]], because [[Hazel]] can also           |
| 03:34      | automatically get rid of files that are over a certain size. So I think I set mine to two               |
| 03:39      | gigabytes or something, and I've just said, if I trash it, I think that's over two gigs,                |
| 03:42      | just get rid of it permanently for me, because that's the kind of thing where you're there,             |
| 03:46      | you're desperately trying to save space on your machine, because it's running out of storage space,     |
| 03:50      | and your trashing stuff, but you're not actually improving the situation, because it's still there      |
| 03:55      | until you've emptied the trash, at which point it's actually gone. And so I use [[Hazel]] as well to        |
| 04:01      | help me with that. And also [[Hazel]] can do this as well, where it will automatically empty the trash,     |
| 04:06      | and you can set that to less than 30 days. So you could say that said,                                  |
| 04:10      | automatically delete anything that's been in my trash for two days or a week or something,              |
| 04:14      | which is more of a fine grain control over what's built into the Mac.                                   |
| 04:18      | Yeah, this is one of those examples of a third-party developer showing up and just,                     |
| 04:24      | you know, doing a better job of it than Apple with more details, you know, more                         |
| 04:29      | automator love here. And the thing I like about the way [[Hazel]] does it is, first of all,                 |
| 04:35      | you can make rules in [[Hazel]] that manage your trash, and we're going to talk about [[Hazel]] later           |
| 04:40      | with respect to the Finder and automatically managing files. But the trash button in [[Hazel]],             |
| 04:46      | it's just a feature that, again, people may not realise is there because you buy [[Hazel]] for that         |
| 04:53      | magic rule system where it automatically moves files around for you. But there's a whole                |
| 04:57      | trash system in the [[Hazel]] preference pane, and you can have it delete files, and you can set it         |
| 05:03      | very granularly. I mean, like the default, I believe, is one week, but you can say after 10 days,       |
| 05:09      | or after seven months, or whatever you want, where it automatically deletes files.                      |
| 05:15      | But you've also got the ability just to say, keep my trash no bigger than X, you know,                  |
| 05:20      | let's say three gigabytes. So if your trash ever gets bigger than three gigabytes, it just starts       |
| 05:26      | deleting files probably, I believe by age, you know, the older, the sooner. But you can say,            |
| 05:33      | I just want to keep my trash to a certain level. That button also has what [[Hazel]] calls AppSweep,        |
| 05:40      | which is a different form of trash. You know, when you delete an application, sometimes                 |
| 05:45      | they do have system files they install on your system in various places.                                |
| 05:48      | The original system on the Mac was supposed to have all that contained within the application.          |
| 05:54      | So when you would delete the app, it was truly gone. That's not true anymore. I mean, the Mac           |
| 05:58      | operating system has evolved so much that there's plenty of apps that write little files into your      |
| 06:04      | user folder in different places. So with Hazel's AppSweep, it will go through and clean all that        |
| 06:09      | out, too. So if you want to manage your, you know, cleaning your trash automatically,                   |
| 06:15      | I would definitely turn on the Apple thing, the 30 day thing from Apple if you don't have anything,     |
| 06:22      | but I would honestly consider purchasing [[Hazel]] and installing it. I think it's a much more powerful     |
| 06:28      | tool along with one other that I think is really good for trash management. And these two apps          |
| 06:35      | are going to probably be the stars of this episode because they come up in so many different            |
| 06:39      | categories of automatically managing maintenance in your Mac. But the other one,                        |
| 06:43      | if you're listening, but you're guessing it, it's CleanMyMac. CleanMyMac does a really good             |
| 06:48      | job of this, too. So to be clear, we're talking about the CleanMyMac, which is made by MacPaw,          |
| 06:53      | the same people who make setup. There is another similar app called MacKeeper, which is not the         |
| 06:57      | one that we're recommending here. Setup and MacPaw have done a really great job with CleanMyMac.        |
| 07:02      | You've got all these sorts of buttons and knobs and toggles inside of CleanMyMac that you can           |
| 07:07      | tweak and click. And you can get really nerdy and micromanage everything if you like, or you can        |
| 07:11      | just let it run. And it'll tell you what it's going to do anyway. And it can then just do a             |
| 07:16      | great job. But it can also get rid of things like extra translation files on your machine that you      |
| 07:20      | don't need, which is really nice. Yeah, that one's going to come up in several of these categories,     |
| 07:25      | because it does such a good job of getting through a lot of different things on your Mac. And like,     |
| 07:32      | if you're looking for automated maintenance stuff, this is an app definitely worth buying. I would      |
| 07:37      | actually recommend, if you're interested in it, just going in and perhaps trying to set                 |
| 07:43      | app subscription. It's by the same company, MacPaw has set up. They also make CleanMyMac. But           |
| 07:48      | just every time I go into setup, I just went in there this morning to download a copy of Gemini,        |
| 07:53      | which we're going to talk about later. And I just can't get over how many apps are in here. Now,        |
| 07:58      | Pathfinder is in there. I mean, it's like, every time I open it, there's another app that I usually     |
| 08:02      | pay money for that's in the service. So that's worth checking out just kind of in general. But          |
| 08:09      | it's an excellent tool. I think that [[Hazel]] is the app I actually choose to manage my trash              |
| 08:18      | collection and throwing out for me. I use CleanMyMac for a whole lot of other things. And frankly,      |
| 08:24      | when I do run CleanMyMac, it doesn't be my trash for me too. But Hazel's the one that I like in         |
| 08:29      | particular for this particular problem. What about you? Well, I actually use both the built-in          |
| 08:35      | Mac setting and [[Hazel]] because so I've actually got [[Hazel]] set to keep my trash under a gigabyte.         |
| 08:42      | And it does a great job of that. But every so often, I don't really trash that much stuff. I go         |
| 08:46      | through periods where there's not a lot of stuff in there. And so I could have files in there that      |
| 08:52      | have been there for more than 30 days. So I use both because they're not colliding. They're not         |
| 08:56      | fighting with each other to see who can clear the trash first and causing issues on my machine.         |
| 09:00      | One of them is literally just looking to see if anything's older than 30 days. And the other            |
| 09:04      | one's going, hey, use your trash over a gigabyte. And working together, they help keep my Mac clean     |
| 09:08      | and tidy. All right. Now, this next category is about automating desktop cleanup and download           |
| 09:16      | folder. But desktop in particular, Rose, I don't know what your practice is. What's your desktop        |
| 09:22      | look like today? Is it covered in icons? No. Okay. So I use the show stacks or the use stacks           |
| 09:30      | feature. So if you right click on your desktop on a Mac, then you can toggle on use stacks. And         |
| 09:35      | basically, this tries to group like items together. So I have a stack on my desktop of screenshots,     |
| 09:40      | which I've been taking for an article that I've been writing. And I have four screenshots in that.      |
| 09:44      | But they'll only be there probably for another day because if it's something that's over two days,      |
| 09:51      | something that's over two days old, and it's on my desktop, then it gets moved. And I have set up       |
| 09:57      | a couple of [[Hazel]] rules. So I move screenshots off to a Dropbox folder called screenshots.              |
| 10:03      | It's very creative naming. And it's just basically a place to keep these things just in case I really   |
| 10:08      | do need them. And what I've been trying to do recently, and I'm not sure if it's worked or not,         |
| 10:13      | and I'm not going to mess with it well on the show just in case I accidentally kill my recording,       |
| 10:17      | is I've told Dropbox actually don't sync that folder locally. So what this does is it then              |
| 10:22      | moves things to Dropbox. So I can still get at it. It's just not locally stored on my machine.          |
| 10:25      | So I'm saving a little bit of space. I have a 512 gigabyte SSD, so I'm probably not going to run        |
| 10:30      | out of storage anytime soon. I'm only using about half of that. But I try and get things moved off      |
| 10:35      | of my desktop after a day or two. Because for a day or two, I can live with a few things being there.   |
| 10:40      | But I also like to use [[Yoink]] to shove things in if I'm just moving stuff around and they need to        |
| 10:46      | put it somewhere temporarily. All right, that was a lot of information. Okay, so I want to start        |
| 10:51      | with the beginning. You made mention of the Mac OS solution for automatically cleaning your desktop.    |
| 10:58      | And it's called stacks. And I think this is a very underrated feature on the Mac. Okay,                 |
| 11:05      | so the way it works like Rosette, just right click on your desktop, and then it magically               |
| 11:11      | collects every different type of document and puts them into stacks for you. So                         |
| 11:15      | if you've got a bunch of PDFs, it'll have a stack of PDFs, and it renders them                          |
| 11:19      | in a way that's very clever. It looks like a stack of paper. And like, for instance, PDFs,              |
| 11:25      | it actually renders the image of the PDF. It's not a generic PDF icon. It is the actual PDFs            |
| 11:33      | that you have. Does the same thing for Word documents and different, you know, different                |
| 11:37      | types of things for you. And as you put things on your desktop, they automatically get added to the     |
| 11:42      | stack. Now, this is some automation you can bring into the life of your loved ones that don't listen    |
| 11:48      | to the automators podcast, right? You just go in, you right click it, and it automatically              |
| 11:56      | organises all that because everybody knows the person that has their desktop covered in icons.          |
| 12:02      | And this is something you can do to help them. I would recommend, however, that you help them           |
| 12:08      | in a way that they are aware of, that you don't just do it. I seem to remember a story on Mac           |
| 12:14      | Power users where every where you helped Daisy and Daisy was it was not the happiest with your          |
| 12:19      | assistance. No, man, the the the person that I share a bed with was really angry with me because I      |
| 12:27      | you know, I I tried to organise this was before stacks, I just made a folder on her desktop said        |
| 12:32      | all of Daisy's doc desktop files because they were overlapping each other. Like, literally, it was      |
| 12:38      | like she lapped the desktop, right? The icons started generating on top of each other because           |
| 12:44      | there were so many of them. And she she woke me up from sound sleep. I thought the house was on         |
| 12:49      | fire. So as I told the story on Mac Power users years ago, but I it was like, you know, it's like       |
| 12:54      | this. That's one of the moments in my marriage where she was really mad at me. We don't have that       |
| 13:00      | many, you know, moments like that. But the anyway, so so yeah, like I said, check in with your          |
| 13:06      | significant other before you do that. But but stacks is way better than the way I did it because        |
| 13:11      | it kind of shows you the documents organised. Now, now that's for the non nerds in your life. Now,      |
| 13:16      | for the nerds, the people listening to the automator show stacks is still great. I mean,                |
| 13:21      | even though like, I'm going to talk in a minute about how I automatically deal with the stuff           |
| 13:25      | using [[Hazel]], I still use stacks too, because I just think it's so much cleaner to have these            |
| 13:31      | little stacks of documents. Now that being said, I don't want these stacks on my desktop. I am,         |
| 13:37      | you know, I have a shutdown routine, you know, that because I'm I'm manic every day, I have to          |
| 13:43      | like shut my day down. And one of the things I do in the shutdown routine is everything comes off       |
| 13:48      | the desktop, you know, it if it's something that I'm working on, it needs to go to where belongs        |
| 13:54      | or it needs to go in the trash. If I leave them there for a few days, then what happens is I            |
| 13:57      | have extra documents and copies of things I'm working on for legal clients. And I'm not sure            |
| 14:02      | what is, you know, proper and what isn't, you know, what's the just things I in my experience,          |
| 14:10      | if I don't do it every day, it takes much longer to do it every few days. So I do it every day.         |
| 14:15      | And so my desktop gets cleaned every day. But during the course of the day, I have nice little          |
| 14:20      | stacks of documents. So that's my system. That's a good system. And the other one I mentioned           |
| 14:26      | is [[Yoink]]. And [[Yoink]] isn't actually necessarily desktop storage. It's just a little application          |
| 14:33      | that lives on the side of your your Mac screen, you choose which which spot to put it on. And it        |
| 14:39      | appears when you drag documents or files of any kind over to it. And then it stays there. Well,         |
| 14:45      | it's got something on top of it. And I really like this because it's there shoving in my face that I    |
| 14:49      | was going to do something very quickly with this document. And I haven't got around to it yet.          |
| 14:54      | It's very useful at work when when you're likely to be interrupted, for example,                        |
| 14:58      | which is probably the same if you have, you know, a significant other or kids at home or                |
| 15:02      | something. You know, and so then that thing is there. And it's just sitting there and staring           |
| 15:07      | at you going, what are you going to do with me? And then when you drag something out of your            |
| 15:10      | ink, you can you can set it up so that it just disappears. So it's it's like a temporary shelf          |
| 15:16      | that you stick stuff on. And then you pull it out. And it's gone. Or you can set it so that             |
| 15:21      | [[Yoink]] keeps it. It's up to you. But I really like that shelves are really great for this is kind        |
| 15:28      | of on the edge of automation. But the shelves are just a really great tool in general for moving        |
| 15:32      | stuff around, particularly if you've got a smaller laptop and you need to put some some apps in full    |
| 15:37      | screen shelves can save your bacon so often. One of the things about [[Yoink]] that Royce didn't            |
| 15:43      | mention is that they also have an excellent iOS app and it uses iCloud storage. So anything you         |
| 15:49      | put into [[Yoink]] on your Mac shows up in [[Yoink]] on your iPad, which is really great. Yeah, I have to       |
| 15:55      | say I really like [[Yoink]]. And that's not just because it's made by somebody in Vienna. But it's          |
| 16:00      | just a very good app that I found to be extremely useful for me. And as we mentioned earlier,           |
| 16:05      | set up is probably going to be mentioned quite a few times in this episode, it is part of setup         |
| 16:08      | as well. So you can buy it directly from the Mac App Store or set up depending on your preferences.     |
| 16:14      | I didn't realise that that was an Austrian developer. I'm pretty sure that the guy is Austrian. I'm     |
| 16:19      | now probably thinking of completely the wrong developer. And so I'm very sorry if that is the           |
| 16:23      | case. But I'm pretty certain that that person is in Austria, even in Vienna, I think. Nice. Well,       |
| 16:32      | I do think that [[Yoink]] is excellent. There is another similar app I would mention that is really good.   |
| 16:41      | And it is a little more automation type app, and it's called Drop Zone. The current version is          |
| 16:46      | Drop Zone 3. Yeah. And with Drop Zone, you can make little, I guess you would call them scripts,        |
| 16:51      | but basically it comes out of the top menu bar. If you just drag a file and pull it anywhere,           |
| 16:56      | your desktop, it drops down. Hence the name. But you can put little things in there, like you can       |
| 17:01      | say anything. You can create a new one that says move or copy to a folder. Like I have the action       |
| 17:08      | folder that is kind of like a place, a temporary storage for stuff for me before I have [[Hazel]]           |
| 17:13      | Rules run on them. And I have in Drop Zone the action folder there. So any file I click and drag,       |
| 17:21      | Drop Zone will drop down. I can just lay it on top of that action folder and it moves it to the         |
| 17:25      | action folder. Another really handy one I have is copy to desktop, where sometimes I'm on a             |
| 17:31      | website and I have a file I pull out or I'm just doing something where I want to save a copy of         |
| 17:37      | the file somewhere. And as much as I railed against storing stuff on the desktop for multiple days,     |
| 17:44      | I do use the desktop during the day all the time. I think it's a great temporary storage place.         |
| 17:50      | So rather than move to desktop, I use a copy to desktop command there. So I can just put a copy         |
| 17:56      | on my desktop that I can use. A lot of the stuff I do with the legal job is I get contracts and         |
| 18:01      | revise them. I make my own revisions to them. So I want a copy. And then I work from that from          |
| 18:07      | the desktop. Then at the end of the day, I can automate where I'm going to put it.                      |
| 18:11      | But so there's kind of two apps that scratch two different niches there, [[Yoink]] and Drop Zone.           |
| 18:18      | I don't know. Drop Zone is probably part of setup.                                                      |
| 18:20      | It is. That's where I got it from. And I'm just going to take a momentary diversion.                    |
| 18:26      | Seeing as we're talking about Drop Zone already, I also use Drop Zone to install apps. Because what     |
| 18:31      | you can do is you can drag and drop a package file or a DMG file or even just a.app file onto it.       |
| 18:38      | And if it's a DMG or a package, then it will unpack those and walk you through the process              |
| 18:44      | and then get rid of those files at the end. It will automatically eject them and delete them.           |
| 18:48      | I didn't even know it did that.                                                                         |
| 18:50      | Yeah. So you can install plugins in Drop Zone. And this is where it gets super, super                   |
| 18:55      | automatically nerdy. Because I even have the ability to upload files to FTP.                            |
| 19:01      | So I can upload the automators file on Friday. As this episode goes out, I'll have done this by         |
| 19:06      | dragging it from that folder in Dropbox that we share over into Drop Zone and having it uploaded        |
| 19:12      | to Libsyn for us in the background. And that's super useful.                                             |
| 19:16      | I would like you to send me a video of that because I'm going to start doing that.                      |
| 19:21      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 19:21      | Show me the details, Rose. Yes. So what you can do, I'm just going to explain a little bit on           |
| 19:28      | there. So if you open Drop Zone, then there should be a plus. And then you can add different            |
| 19:32      | kinds of actions. And one of them is an FTP upload. And you can set that up. And that is so             |
| 19:38      | useful. You also have messages and different stuff in there. So this is more of a way of                |
| 19:44      | sharing things, usually. But most of these in the background are either, I believe,                     |
| 19:50      | Ruby or Python scripts. And so if you know Ruby or Python, then you can enhance these.                  |
| 19:56      | And if you are good at Googling and in general, you know, like guessing what code might go              |
| 20:02      | together and you have some dummy files for test purposes, then you can go ahead and modify these        |
| 20:07      | because they even have like email actions and stuff like that. And if you're smarter than me,           |
| 20:12      | because I haven't got around to this yet, then you can set it up to say, for example,                   |
| 20:17      | email the file and then delete it, which is, you know, what we want to do because we want               |
| 20:22      | to clear the stuff up when we're done with it most of the time, or save it somewhere in particular.     |
| 20:28      | Yeah, it's really another thing you can do in Drop Zone. I guess we're kind of off on                   |
| 20:32      | a little tangent here. But you can save items to the Drop Zone drop-down. And you can also do this       |
| 20:38      | with [[Yoink]]. But you can lock them into Drop Zone so they don't accidentally get deleted later.          |
| 20:44      | And I, as a screencaster, I have images of the iPad and the iPhone that I overlay when I record         |
| 20:51      | a screencast, you know, like when I record a screencast of the iPhone, it's just the iPhone             |
| 20:56      | screen. It's not the actual iPhone frame around it. So then once I put it into ScreenFlow,              |
| 21:02      | I can just grab the frame out of Drop Zone and put it on top of the image in ScreenFlow.                |
| 21:07      | So it's just like always available for me. So if you've got like little, like maybe your company        |
| 21:11      | has a logo that you constantly are dropping into documents and things with an app like Drop Zone        |
| 21:17      | or [[Yoink]], you could put them in there and just have that. It's like almost a permanent clipboard        |
| 21:22      | that's very easily accessible. So that's kind of nice.                                                  |
| 21:25      | Yeah, it's a very useful tool. And there are a few other apps as well where you can automatically       |
| 21:32      | upload things to specific servers and stuff like that. But I personally find that between Drop Zone     |
| 21:37      | and [[Yoink]], I am very happy. I've never actually used Drop Zone for the whole dragging and dropping      |
| 21:41      | files and temporarily storing it. I, for some reason, just really like [[Yoink]] and continue to            |
| 21:46      | use it for that. It's got a little special place in my heart.                                           |
| 21:49      | Well, it makes sense. And frankly, [[Yoink]] is the one I normally do that on because of the iOS app.       |
| 21:55      | You know, I am constantly going between iPad and Mac. So I love that once I put it in [[Yoink]],            |
| 22:02      | I've got it on all platforms. Drop Zone doesn't do that. But, you know, it's funny that both of us      |
| 22:09      | have settled on these two tools and there are quite a few out there. Because we hadn't talked           |
| 22:14      | about this going in. No, that's the thing. For the listeners at home, we did not really compare         |
| 22:20      | notes too much before we started. So we have an outline of our show, but we don't script this           |
| 22:25      | before we record it. We hope that we don't overrule the other person on our steel too many picks.       |

| 23:40      | Okay, so the one thing we didn't mention with this file management at the desktop is the most           |
| 23:46      | powerful tool is [[Hazel]]. We did a whole show on file management automation, so we're not going to        |
| 23:51      | redo that here, but you could go listen to it if you'd like, but [[Hazel]] by far is the most powerful      |
| 23:57      | way to deal with file management because you can set very specific conditions, you know,                |
| 24:03      | if it's a file that includes the name Rose and it's a PDF, put it in this folder.                       |
| 24:08      | You know, I did a whole screencast field guide on [[Hazel]]. I've done a ton of free stuff too.             |
| 24:15      | If you go to MacSparky, Rose has done stuff on [[Hazel]] too. It's just, it's just an amazing tool.        |
| 24:22      | I used to, before I knew about [[Hazel]], I used to write AppleScripts to try and manage this stuff.       |
| 24:26      | [[Hazel]] does such a better job. It's more consistent. It's very easy and anybody can do it, you know.     |
| 24:32      | It's so you, like I said earlier, you can set multiple conditions and in the event that conditions      |
| 24:37      | are satisfied or not satisfied, it's very flexible. You can have it move, delete, do just about any     |
| 24:44      | kind of file management thing you can think of with a file. So if I haven't made the cell for it        |
| 24:49      | yet, go download [[Hazel]] and try it because it is one of the most powerful Mac automation tools that      |
| 24:56      | anybody can use. While we're still talking about file cleanup, I do just want to mention as well        |
| 25:01      | that [[Hazel]] also has a feature that's only available in the downloads folder on your Mac,                |
| 25:06      | where it can automatically remove incomplete downloads after a specific time period.                    |
| 25:10      | I don't know about you, but every time, every cell to my connection will drop out when, especially      |
| 25:14      | when I'm traveling and I'm using a Wi-Fi. And so I ended up with like three or four downloads of        |
| 25:19      | the same file in various different completion stages. And then the fifth one has, of course,            |
| 25:24      | got everything in and that's the one that I use, but I not very good at cleaning this up by myself.     |
| 25:29      | So there's a nice feature in [[Hazel]] where it can automatically get rid of incomplete downloads.          |
| 25:33      | I've set mine to after a day just in case because some files can take a very long time to download.     |
| 25:38      | But it works pretty nicely. And it's useful to get your files cleaned up, because I find if my          |
| 25:44      | files aren't cleaned up, then, well, everything else seems to go everywhere. I feel like an octopus.    |
| 25:51      | You know, something weird I do is I reset Safari to make the download location my desktop.              |
| 25:59      | And I've been doing that for a long time, but it just, you know, when you put it in the downloads       |
| 26:04      | folder, I, you know, I, I'm a gadfly for get it's there, you know, and I just don't do anything with    |
| 26:11      | it. By putting it on the desktop, when I get to the end of the day, it just forces me to address        |
| 26:15      | whatever I've done today, you know, whatever I've downloaded, it gets, it's on the desktop, I need      |
| 26:20      | to get it. Usually if it's like a client thing, I need to get it filed in the right place. I just       |
| 26:24      | don't want, you know, my download folder to become this, you know, rat's nest of files.                 |
| 26:32      | What I do is my download folder is actually pinned at my dock is right next to the trash to make it     |
| 26:35      | nice and easy to drag stuff over. But I have it display as the stack instead of as a folder. So         |
| 26:42      | I can easily see that there's stuff in there that I need to deal with, because when it's empty,         |
| 26:47      | it goes back to showing up as a folder. And it's really nice to just be able to click on that and       |
| 26:52      | then drag that, that one file that you need out somewhere. So for example, I think I need to add        |
| 26:57      | a drop zone action to, to move the, the altimeter's guest recordings into the right folder. Because     |
| 27:03      | we had one of those recently, and it's sitting in my downloads folder right now waiting for me to       |
| 27:08      | deal with it. Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. The related subject is a large file management on         |
| 27:16      | your Mac. And we all have, you know, big files that we collect as podcasters, you and I particularly    |
| 27:22      | have lots of big files, but you know, maybe you've got games you've downloaded or for work, you've      |
| 27:28      | got large media projects. It's easy to have these things on your drive buried in some subfolder         |
| 27:35      | somewhere and lose track of the fact they're there. And as your drive starts creeping towards           |
| 27:40      | being full, you don't know how to go find them and get rid of them. So there's some great tools         |
| 27:46      | for that. Once again, let's start with, you know, as Mac has done a better job of trying to address     |
| 27:51      | this, we'll go back to the about my Mac folder to the storage button and then the manage button. And    |
| 27:57      | there is an option there called was it reduce clutter. And they've got their where it will              |
| 28:07      | assemble a list of large files on your device and let you look through them by various criteria         |
| 28:13      | and, you know, delete some of them. It by default arranges them by size. Like I've got a 43 gigabyte    |
| 28:22      | file, which is my final cut YouTube library. I need to break that apart. I don't need a 43 gigabyte     |
| 28:28      | file on my drive, you know, but the so you know, you've got stuff like that in there. And look at       |
| 28:34      | that. See, I've got a Siri shortcuts video zip archive that JF sent me when we were working on          |
| 28:41      | that. It's eight gigabytes just sitting there, just using space. See, already learning things,          |
| 28:47      | you know, and they did a pretty good job with it. This is one where the native tool is actually         |
| 28:51      | pretty powerful. You can look at by downloads as well. They've got stuff in their support files         |
| 28:58      | for unsupported apps. Now that we've gone to 64 bit, you'll see a bunch of 32 bit apps that             |
| 29:04      | there's data in there. There's a 570 megabyte abbey fine reader file. My Mac that is serving no         |
| 29:13      | purpose because it doesn't run anymore, you know, and then you can also just like look through by       |
| 29:18      | different file browsers, like, you know, Dropbox, you know, or whatever your big folders are, and       |
| 29:24      | you can look through there to see where the data hogs are. So using the built-in tool for this,         |
| 29:30      | you can actually find quite a bit. Yeah, I have to say, it's really useful to have this. And it's       |
| 29:35      | worth these things. If you didn't know it was there, you probably go and download another file to do    |
| 29:39      | it. And I'm pretty certain that CleanMyMac can also tell you about really large files that you        |
| 29:42      | have running around as well. That said, I am still using my good old friend, OmniDisk Sweeper,          |
| 29:48      | which is made by the Omni Group. And it's a free tool that they offer. And you can just select          |
| 29:54      | a drive. And what I like is you can you can run this on external drives as well, because you can        |
| 29:58      | select an external drive. And you can just go, hey, you go have a look at this, and it'll come back     |
| 30:03      | and it'll tell you exactly what the biggest stuff is. And it doesn't limit it based on, you know,       |
| 30:09      | what kind of media it is. So for example, if I'm in my documents, it's just looking at my documents,    |
| 30:13      | it's not looking at applications. So it's not telling me that Creative Cloud is actually taking         |
| 30:17      | up a ton of space on this machine. And let's be honest, I probably don't need Creative Cloud on         |
| 30:21      | this particular machine, actually, because I mostly just use it to record audio and the actual          |
| 30:26      | editing is done elsewhere. Yeah, there's another, there's a similar one that is a paid version.         |
| 30:31      | It's very pretty called DaisyDisk. They were a sponsor of Mac Power users years ago. I like it          |
| 30:37      | because it's got my wife's name in it. That's kind of fun. But they do these concentric circles.        |
| 30:42      | It's very, it's a very nice way to find data hogs. And then Rose mentioned, once again,                 |
| 30:48      | CleanMyMac, that's that app that is going to keep showing up. They've got a system to do the same       |
| 30:52      | thing. theirs is also prettier than the Apple one. I think the CleanMyMac one is better for             |
| 31:00      | people who are not super nerdy. I think it does a better job of exposing the big files                  |
| 31:07      | for you. So I would recommend that for people that, if you've got someone in your life that             |
| 31:13      | is interested in getting a little bit better at this, just install CleanMyMac for them,                 |
| 31:17      | and it'll do all the work for them. But for the nerdier side of us, you can do it on the Mac            |
| 31:26      | with this built-in tool or with one of the other tools that Rose and I talked about.                    |
| 31:30      | Yeah. So if you're doing maintenance on somebody else's machine this holiday season,                    |
| 31:35      | because we're all those people that get called on to do that and you want to do it as fast as you       |
| 31:39      | can and as automated as you can, either use the built-in Mac tools or install a copy of CleanMyMac      |
| 31:44      | on everyone's machine and just tell them to click the button every once in a while.                     |
| 31:48      | And that's pretty much as automated as it gets. You can get nerdy and fine-grain it, but I find         |
| 31:55      | that it's pretty good at figuring out the large files that you haven't touched in a while and           |
| 31:59      | that you probably don't need. So I've got a massive screen recording on here, 16 gigabytes from March.  |
| 32:04      | I don't even remember doing this. So I need to get rid of that.                                         |
| 32:08      | Well, that's something that we are both making mistakes here is I used to have an OmniFocus              |
| 32:15      | task that would repeat and tell me to go in and do this every few months. And I don't know              |
| 32:21      | somehow that dropped off the radar because I must have deleted the task as opposed to                   |
| 32:27      | marking it complete because I've got a bunch of stuff in here. After we finish recording today,         |
| 32:31      | I'm going to go open up a bunch of like 100 gigs on my drive.                                           |
| 32:34      | Well, I'm still only half full. So I'm not yet reaching the point where I need to do                    |
| 32:41      | anything crazy, but there's definitely quite a few things in here that I'm looking at and going,        |
| 32:45      | yeah, I should really clear some of this stuff out. At the very least, I'm going to move some of        |
| 32:51      | this stuff off of my machine and onto external storage. But you know the thing is, Rose,                |
| 32:56      | it's almost the amount of free space is almost irrelevant to me. It just makes me mad                   |
| 33:00      | that this stuff is on my drive when I don't need to have it on my drive.                                |
| 33:08      | Well, I mean, the one thing that's worse than having big things on your drive that you don't            |
| 33:12      | need is having duplicates on your drive because that drives me insane. And they're looking at it        |
| 33:16      | and I'm going, oh my gosh, why have I got six of this file in my downloads folder?                      |
| 33:20      | Like this makes zero sense. We have a solution for that.                                                |
| 33:24      | Well, we have two solutions for this because guess what? [[Hazel]] comes back again. Hazel's great.         |
| 33:28      | It can delete duplicate files within the same folder. And I love that so much because it's              |
| 33:33      | there going, hey, you just downloaded exactly the same file again. Wake up, delete it.                  |
| 33:38      | And I'm there and I'm about to click on it and I'm like, wait, where'd it go? Oh, it's down here.       |
| 33:42      | Oh, I downloaded it three hours ago. Okay. Well, thank you, [[Hazel]]. And it's really useful because       |
| 33:48      | it gets rid of those duplicates for you and that does make my life easier. And if you want to           |
| 33:53      | keep something because you're modifying something, then of course you can just move it to another       |
| 33:56      | folder where that doesn't happen. So for example, I don't have duplicate to clean up on my desktop      |
| 34:00      | because everything on my desktop gets moved elsewhere where the duplicate cleanup does                  |
| 34:04      | happen. And if it's still a duplicate, by the time it goes somewhere else, then it gets deleted.        |
| 34:09      | No, I agree. I agree. And then there's an app for that as well, you know, back to our old friends       |
| 34:15      | at MacPaw. The app, Jim and I, which I made reference to earlier in the show, is a very                 |
| 34:22      | user-friendly, very powerful deduplication tool. You know, if you've got, this is a great tool,         |
| 34:28      | honestly, we were talking about the holidays, when you're on like a family member's computer            |
| 34:32      | and they tell you that their drive is full, install a copy of Gemini on their computer and              |
| 34:38      | I guarantee you will open up like somewhere between 10 and 25% of their drive because                   |
| 34:44      | everybody has a lot of junk on there and Gemini goes through and finds it, even goes through and        |
| 34:48      | finds duplicate pictures that are, you know, relatively the same thing, gives you the option            |
| 34:55      | to get rid of those. I'm going to be including it in the photos field guide I'm working on right        |
| 34:59      | now. But the Gemini is, in my opinion, the best deduplication tool on the Mac.                          |
| 35:05      | Yes, yeah, it's extremely useful and it's got a visual comparison as well. So for example,              |
| 35:09      | in the case of the pictures, you can look at it and you can go, are these actually the same?            |
| 35:13      | Yes, they very clearly are the same picture of the pavement that I took when I was walking              |
| 35:18      | because I accidentally clicked the wrong button on my iPhone and then you can actually find that        |
| 35:23      | in Finder and just delete it instead of deleting just the duplicate. So you can get rid of all          |
| 35:28      | the copies if you want to. And this is an area where automation makes so much sense because             |
| 35:35      | going through getting rid of duplicates manually is not only tedious, it's also dangerous. It's         |
| 35:40      | very easy to make mistakes when you do this. Very good to find that out to software that's              |
| 35:46      | a little bit better at managing this stuff than we are.                                                 |
| 35:51      | Certain things humans aren't very good at. This is one of them.                                         |
| 35:54      | Let's round out Finder Automation. The idea of automatic project folder creation,                       |
| 36:02      | we talked about this with Don McAllister a month or two ago. He talked about this app Posthaste,        |
| 36:08      | which is a kind of a uni-tasker app that creates a whole folder setup for you.                          |
| 36:12      | If you do a bunch of projects, I think this is probably the app for you. It'll do it.                   |
| 36:18      | You can also do something like that via [[Keyboard Maestro]], even [[AppleScript]]. I used to have an          |
| 36:23      | automator script I ran that created a bunch of folders, but it was a little hard because                |
| 36:28      | automator is hard to pass variables automators, so I couldn't really get it to do it exactly the way    |
| 36:32      | I wanted. But you could absolutely do this with [[AppleScript]]. Yeah. And I have to say I've been         |
| 36:38      | running this with [[Keyboard Maestro]] for quite some time, just because it's very good at doing things     |
| 36:43      | like that. Though I have to say, in one case, I kind of teetered, and I'm using [[Keyboard Maestro]]        |
| 36:50      | and [[Hazel]]. And that's because what I do is I use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to help me rename some files,         |
| 36:59      | and then [[Hazel]] sorts it into a subfolder, which will create a subfolder for me if one is not there.     |
| 37:04      | And I have to say that combination there is very useful for, in this particular case,                   |
| 37:09      | I'm looking at podcasting projects. So whenever I create a new podcast episode,                         |
| 37:13      | then it automatically goes, hey, here's a new folder, done. And I don't need to think about it.         |
| 37:18      | So walk us through what you're doing. So what I do is when the episode finishes recording,              |
| 37:24      | then [[Keyboard Maestro]] is watching that folder, and it goes, hey, you have a new episode of              |
| 37:29      | automators, or hey, you have a new episode of nested folders. Which episode number is this? And         |
| 37:35      | then I type in the episode number, and I hit OK, and it moves it to another folder.                     |
| 37:40      | Let me interrupt this for a second. And so the way, how does it know that you just finished             |
| 37:43      | recording? That is a very good question. I believe [[Keyboard Maestro]], and I'm just having a look to      |
| 37:50      | see, so I think what it does is it checks that the file hasn't been edited in the last minute           |
| 37:56      | or so. And this is another thing that, of course, [[Hazel]] can do as well. But in this case, I wanted      |
| 38:02      | to use the GUI in [[Keyboard Maestro]], because I'm also using the variables there.                         |
| 38:07      | So it's looking for the existence of a file. I just wanted to get across the audience. It's like,       |
| 38:12      | the creation of a file is what kicks everything off.                                                    |
| 38:15      | Yes. So it weighs for me to have created a file, or added a file to that folder. So I can also move     |
| 38:23      | things into it. And then it pops up, and it asks me, and it uses a variable so that it can reuse        |
| 38:27      | that variable next time. So I usually just have to increment by one. So for example, the last           |
| 38:32      | episode that we recorded was 36 is 37. And so I can just increase that number by one. And that          |
| 38:41      | makes my life a little bit easier, unless we record episodes out of order, which occasionally           |
| 38:45      | happens. But that's something I can deal with. Like today. Yeah, exactly. Like today and yesterday.     |
| 38:54      | So yeah, so then [[Keyboard Maestro]] moves this to a specific folder. And then [[Hazel]] knows that it         |
| 39:01      | needs to move it into a different folder, but then it uses this sort into subfolder. So what it does    |
| 39:06      | is it matches part of the file name, which is the episode number. And then it just moves it             |
| 39:11      | into a subfolder. And that's really useful. You can also sort into subfolders based on dates. So        |
| 39:15      | you could have, for example, 2019, and then like 12 for the December, if you wanted to.                 |
| 39:22      | But I do like the idea of combining folder creation into that. And that's something that,               |
| 39:28      | everybody could automate this. It's just something a lot of people need. And it's just not that         |
| 39:34      | difficult. And like I said, and if all else fails, if you're listening to this show and you're          |
| 39:37      | scratching your head saying this is too complicated, just go download that up post haste, you know,     |
| 39:43      | and it'll do it for you. Yeah, post haste is excellent. I've been playing with that as well             |
| 39:46      | for some other projects for recording videos for screencast online. Actually, I stole that              |
| 39:51      | from Don seeing as he's doing it. And it's been really useful. That combined with the Zapier            |
| 39:55      | Zap to make a folder in Dropbox, which is them, how I kick the whole thing off because everything       |
| 40:00      | goes in there. That saves my bacon. Yeah, crazy. This episode of The Automators is brought to you       |
| 40:07      | by ExpressVPN. We all know how a VPN protects your privacy and security online. But did you             |
| 40:14      | know it can take your TV watching to the next level by unlocking movies and shows that are              |
| 40:19      | available in other countries? That means you can use ExpressVPN to binge on Dr. Who or Star Trek        |
| 40:25      | on the UK Netflix. You know, I was just thinking about this because the Disney Plus is not available    |
| 40:32      | in the UK. And the Mandalorian is awesome. And my friend Rose can't watch it. But if she                |
| 40:38      | uses ExpressVPN, she could. She could just spoof that she's in the United States,                       |
| 40:42      | get her Disney Plus account and watch the Mandalorian. So just fire up ExpressVPN app,                  |
| 40:47      | change your location to whatever country it's available to, and then refresh Netflix. And               |
| 40:53      | that's it. So ExpressVPN hides your IP address so you can control where you want sites to think         |
| 40:59      | you're located. And you can choose from almost 100 different countries. Just think about all            |
| 41:04      | that Netflix library you can go through. So if you love anime, you can use ExpressVPN to access         |
| 41:11      | Japanese Netflix. And it's not just Netflix. ExpressVPN works with any streaming service,               |
| 41:16      | Hulu, BBC player, iPlayer, YouTube, whatever you want. And there are hundreds of VPNs out there,        |

| 42:16      | So we've gone through files. I think we've covered files pretty thoroughly here. So what's              |
| 42:22      | next, David? We have a little interlude before we get on. I wanted to talk about your calendar.         |
| 42:28      | We did a show on calendar automation, but you're doing something different with calendars               |
| 42:32      | and ICS files that I thought was interesting. Why don't you talk about that?                            |
| 42:36      | Well, it's very simple in many ways because what happens is, so there's a really great public           |
| 42:42      | transport system here in Vienna. And they have a website where you can download your planned            |
| 42:47      | trip as an ICS file. And that's great, except then this ICS file lands in downloads. And then           |
| 42:53      | what do you do with it? Well, then you have to remember to open it and you have to add it to            |
| 42:56      | your calendar and you have to click OK. And it starts to feel like a lot of steps to just do            |
| 43:02      | something that really ought to be maybe one click. So what I do is I have it download the file to       |
| 43:08      | download and then [[Hazel]] just opens this in the [[Apple Calendar|calendar]] app for me. And the step that I'm looking       |
| 43:14      | at automating next is that it will actually use an [[AppleScript]] or something to hit that enter          |
| 43:19      | button and just add it to my default calendar. Ideally, I would like to add it to a specific            |
| 43:24      | travel calendar, but really, I'm not falsely providing ends up in a calendar in my calendar             |
| 43:28      | that I can see I'm pretty happy. And just opening it in calendar is pretty good. But then what I do     |
| 43:34      | is when it's been in there for two hours, it gets deleted from the trash. Because within those two      |
| 43:39      | hours, I should have been able to add it to my calendar. And if not, it's usually in memory,            |
| 43:44      | so I can just click OK later. Yeah, see, the problem with me is I don't like getting invites.           |
| 43:51      | So maybe I need to make a [[Hazel]] rule that says if it has an ICS file, just send it to trash.            |
| 43:59      | Well, in this case, I'm explicitly going and I'm looking it up. It's usually for travel to the          |
| 44:03      | airport and things like that. And I've tried using shortcuts to input this information into my          |
| 44:08      | calendar before and I just don't do it. And I don't know what's wrong with me because I love            |
| 44:13      | playing with shortcuts. So why don't I just do this? But instead, I found the correct solution          |
| 44:18      | for me is why I downloaded it from the website. Have [[Hazel]] just open the darn thing in calendar,        |
| 44:22      | because then I will actually hit OK, because my calendar will be right there in front of me in          |
| 44:26      | my face. And all I have to do is press return. If I want to go crazy and change the calendar on it      |
| 44:31      | to my preferred travel calendar, I can, but I don't have to. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. That's cool.      |
| 44:37      | That's cool. But let's move on to the next one. I want to talk about window management. And             |
| 44:41      | this is another thing that automators need to be on top of, because with these, whether you've got      |
| 44:47      | a big screen in like a 27 inch iMac or you're like me, you've got a 27 inch iMac plus additional        |
| 44:54      | screens on top of that. Or you're running a very small laptop, window management is something           |
| 45:00      | you need to be thinking about. I thought I just kind of talked through what I'm doing.                  |
| 45:04      | I used to use [[Moom]], which was a really great app for window management. And it had some ways that       |
| 45:11      | you can create setups and kind of save them as in essence scripts to run. But over the years,           |
| 45:16      | I've really switched that over to [[Keyboard Maestro]]. I did a video, we'll put a link in the show notes   |
| 45:22      | of a video I did less than a year ago explaining how to set these up with [[Keyboard Maestro]].             |
| 45:28      | But they're very powerful. And to me, a lot of things work in like half screens. So like on my          |
| 45:35      | main iMac screen, I want to be able to very easily make an app on the left or the right side.           |
| 45:42      | And then I've got these vertical monitors on either side. And I want to either put something on         |
| 45:46      | the top or the bottom. And there's a very easy [[Keyboard Maestro]] script you can create for the           |
| 45:52      | currently active window. The keyboard shortcuts I use are the three buttons to the left of the          |
| 45:58      | spacebar. What is it? Control, Option, Command. So if I put Control, Option, Command, Left Arrow,       |
| 46:06      | whatever the current app is, it's the left side of the screen. Right Arrow is the right side of         |
| 46:10      | the screen. The down arrow is 75% of the screen. Like sometimes you want it wider than middle.          |
| 46:18      | And the up arrow is full screen without being full screen, if that makes sense. There's a full          |
| 46:23      | screen mode where it takes over a screen, but this is just full screen. But then if I hold down         |
| 46:28      | the Control and the Option keys, which are the left two of those three keys, I can hit the              |
| 46:35      | up or down, and it goes on the top or the bottom of my left monitor. And if I hold the Option           |
| 46:41      | Control, Option, Command keys, and up or down arrow, that's the right monitor, the top or               |
| 46:47      | bottom of the right. So in my head, I don't even think about it anymore. I can push windows             |
| 46:53      | anywhere I want. And that's really powerful automation, because as you're getting through your          |
| 46:58      | day, the ability to say, okay, I'm done looking at this, but I need it accessible to me, and then       |
| 47:03      | automatically put it in the lower left screen, you're good. And that's the kind of stuff that           |
| 47:09      | that saves you a ton of time.                                                                           |
| 47:12      | Definitely. I really like that. I have a 32 inch ultra wide screen monitor at work. And if you          |
| 47:17      | make any app full screen on that, and it doesn't have text wrapping, then you will get a headache       |
| 47:22      | trying to read from left to right, because 32 inches diagonally of text is just way too much.           |
| 47:28      | So I never use that with just one application in full screen. If I am using full screen,                |
| 47:33      | I always drag a second application into it. But most of the time, I actually use better touch           |
| 47:37      | tool, because [[BetterTouchTool]] has these areas that you can create. And when you drag an app,          |
| 47:43      | then, or if you drag a window, it will show these areas temporarily. And if you drag an app             |
| 47:48      | into that, then it will resize it to whatever it is that you've set. So because my monitor is so        |
| 47:54      | wide, I've actually got a couple of different options. I have my 50% left and right, which              |
| 48:00      | I still rarely use because it's still a lot of screen space, actually. But I also have vertical         |
| 48:05      | thirds. And then every so often, I do need a lot more space with one app. And I'm not using the full    |
| 48:12      | screen, proper full screen version. So what I do is I have some different ones where I can have a       |
| 48:17      | left two third or right two third. And these just sit on the bottom around the dock area. I do have     |
| 48:22      | my dock at the bottom of the screen. Steven Hackett, please don't send me an email. But it works        |
| 48:29      | really well for me because I've got these little floating areas. And if I drag an app into there,       |
| 48:32      | it just resizes it to that area that I've pre specified already. And I really like that. And            |
| 48:38      | I still use the corners to drag things into to make them into quarters as well, because every           |
| 48:44      | so often I need that. And I find that to be a very useful setup for me, especially the three            |
| 48:48      | apps split on one screen. That's really useful. For example, I'll often have like my FTP application,   |
| 48:54      | a text editor and terminal, or a browser text editor and terminal, so that I can be editing one         |
| 49:00      | of my my web projects at work. Yeah, that makes sense. And a related subject, which I cover at          |
| 49:07      | great length in the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide is setups, where this is another type of automation    |
| 49:13      | where you take the power of organising windows, but then you organise specific windows, like if         |
| 49:20      | I'm going to start a podcast, I have a podcast setup where it puts the, you know, the quip document     |
| 49:27      | where Rose and I talk on one screen, and it puts the advertiser ad notes on another screen, and it      |
| 49:34      | puts the recording tools, you know, in view, but not in the way. And I just sets everything up exactly  |
| 49:40      | the way I want. Well, I've done that for all the things I do in my life, I do it for podcasts,          |
| 49:45      | I've got it for doing legal work, I've got it for making screencasts, I've got it for writing           |
| 49:50      | and research. So whatever I want to do, it's just a great feeling to just hit one button.               |
| 49:55      | And with [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can do it with palettes, that's the way I do it. This is too much        |
| 50:01      | for a podcast, but you press one keyboard combination, you get a selection list on the screen, you just |
| 50:06      | pick which thing you're going to do, and then you can do it. And one of the big uses I found            |
| 50:11      | for the Stream Deck, that's this new gizmo I've got that I'm going to be talking about in the           |
| 50:16      | free update, the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide, it's you plug it in, and it's basically a panel          |
| 50:21      | of buttons that you can put custom icons behind, is I put all these setups on buttons. And it's         |
| 50:27      | really great because I just, I don't know, even though I could do it through a palette,                 |
| 50:32      | this is one where I like having the little button, I just press the button and then I can start         |
| 50:36      | working, it's very powerful. How many buttons do you have on your Stream Deck? I have the 32            |
| 50:42      | button one. Okay, and how many buttons are dedicated to setting up your windows, how you like them?     |
| 50:47      | The top row, the eight buttons. Okay, that's quite a few buttons. I'm very tempted to get a             |
| 50:52      | Stream Deck. It's all my Christmas wish list, I'm not sure if I'll be getting it, but I may buy it      |
| 50:56      | for myself as a Christmas or birthday present. Yeah, it's not necessary, but it's nice to have.         |
| 51:04      | Like I said, the palettes and [[Keyboard Maestro]] are very powerful. This actually requires me to          |
| 51:09      | take my hands off the keyboard, but setup changes are usually what I'm doing as I sit down, and         |
| 51:14      | there's something very satisfying. As you sit down, you press the email processing button               |
| 51:19      | or the customer support button, and everything comes up to do all your customer support stuff,          |
| 51:24      | and it's just on your screen, and you can just start doing it. And it's a good way, I guess,            |
| 51:30      | the experience I have is it allows me to avoid getting sidetracked. I think when I first sit            |
| 51:35      | down, my computer's a very easy time to find myself drifting into the web browser or Amazon             |
| 51:40      | or someplace where I would get sidetracked. Yes. Yeah, I find that as well. I sit down and it's         |
| 51:45      | like, oh, I'll just quickly check Twitter, and then like three hours later, it's like, wait,            |
| 51:49      | what rabbit hole did I fall into? Well, there was Mary Poppins, and there was something about this      |
| 51:53      | word Mandalorian. I still don't know what that is, and I'm very, like, I don't want to Google it        |
| 51:57      | in case I find spoilers. Here's the thing, I don't want spoilers. Yeah, I don't blame you. I don't      |
| 52:02      | blame you. I'm not going to give any spoilers, except I'm going to tell everybody, please watch         |
| 52:07      | this. It's so good. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, it's so fun. Well, I'm waiting. Apparently,     |
| 52:12      | it should be out here in Austria, I think later this year or early next year. I'm hoping that           |
| 52:16      | they've heard that January 11th is my birthday, and I'm a big Disney person. So I should get it         |
| 52:22      | for my birthday. Like, that's the thing, right? That's how this works. So I'll cross my fingers.        |
| 52:28      | I don't know what the story is, why they couldn't get that out everywhere, but I'm pretty certain       |
| 52:32      | it's a licensing agreement. So they agree to the content. But yeah, the lawyer's ruin it                |
| 52:37      | everything. David Sparks. Oh, well. Okay, so we have window management, and there are a lot             |
| 52:46      | of windows. I don't know how many windows are up on my Mac. But one other thing I want to say           |
| 52:51      | about window management is I also use [[Keyboard Maestro]] frequently at the end of the day to              |
| 52:55      | close down a lot of the applications that I have running. So for example, when I Skype,                 |
| 53:01      | I actually plug my Zoom H4n Pro into my Mac, and that runs a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that                |
| 53:08      | opens a bunch of windows for me. But I don't yet have one that says, hey, when this unplugged,          |
| 53:14      | close all these windows for me. But at the end of the day, I have a macro that will go through          |
| 53:19      | and it will close things like Skype and [[Audio Hijack]] unless I'm actively using my computer.             |
| 53:24      | So that's the trick, making sure that you're not actively using it because I have podcasted at          |
| 53:29      | odd hours of the day before. And there would be nothing worse than being in the middle of a recording   |
| 53:33      | and then suddenly [[Keyboard Maestro]] goes, bye bye [[Audio Hijack]]. And you're there going, no,              |
| 53:37      | we just lost half of an episode. Yeah, yeah. And that idea of a setup for shutdown is a good one.       |
| 53:46      | Like I have that I have a button that does that too. And just kind of like clearing the decks           |
| 53:52      | for your computer. This is your work device. Why not have it automatically kind of clean                |
| 53:58      | itself up for you at the end of the day. And this is all stuff that you would never do manually.        |
| 54:02      | But if you create automation for it, it makes a difference. I actually wrote an article on              |
| 54:08      | getting your Mac to start up your day with [[Keyboard Maestro]] on the suite setup. So I will               |
| 54:13      | put a link to that in the show notes as well, because it details it. And I'm pretty certain             |
| 54:16      | there was a link to the [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro as well for you to download it as a sample.              |
| 54:21      | Cool. You want to talk about the cloud? Yeah, because I think the cloud is one of these things          |
| 54:28      | where especially I have two terabytes of Dropbox storage space. I have no idea how I ended up with      |
| 54:33      | two terabytes of Dropbox storage space. I know I signed up for one terabyte and they upgraded me        |
| 54:37      | at some point. They doubled it. Yeah, they doubled it. I don't know what to do with two terabytes       |
| 54:41      | of Dropbox storage space. So I end up with a ton of stuff in there and they have this new smart         |
| 54:45      | sync feature. So there are two options with Dropbox where you can say, either don't sync this           |
| 54:52      | folder to my device or there's this kind of alias thing where it looks like the file is on your         |
| 54:56      | device. And then when you click it, if it's not actually on your device, it will download it.           |
| 55:00      | I forgot the name of this feature, but I think it's Smart Sync and Selective Sync are the two           |
| 55:06      | options. And I have been using those a lot because I have two terabytes of Dropbox storage space        |
| 55:11      | and I have a 512 gigabyte SSD. And actually, all of my machines have a 512 gigabyte SSD.                |
| 55:18      | And so I literally couldn't download the entire contents of my Dropbox                                  |
| 55:22      | if I had two terabytes of stuff in there, even if I wanted to. And so I turn off this a lot of          |
| 55:29      | things because, for example, I don't need the entire back catalogue of automators stored on every         |
| 55:34      | single one of my Macs. It's not necessary. So I turn that off on most of my Macs and then I only        |
| 55:39      | have the files that we've recently recorded and they're actively being edited. So, you know,            |
| 55:45      | we're going through and adding chapter markers and stuff because I feel that that's a very good         |
| 55:48      | way of helping clean up your machine without you having to lose data or worry about actually            |
| 55:53      | moving it off somewhere else because in our case, we want to keep this available for both of us.        |
| 55:58      | I would never want us to lose episodes of automators. That would be terrible,                           |
| 56:02      | even though technically we can redownload them from other places. It's still good to have the           |
| 56:06      | audio in our control. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think that the problem you describe        |
| 56:11      | is one a lot of people have. It's like, you know, we've got smaller drives than we have cloud storage.  |
| 56:17      | So you can't have it download everything. And Dropbox and both iCloud have ways to do this.             |
| 56:25      | But figuring that out, I think the Dropbox tools are kind of fidgety. And I think the                   |
| 56:31      | iCloud tools are kind of cryptic. Yeah, well, iCloud is very mystical. It                               |
| 56:37      | removes stuff from your machine if you haven't used it in a while, which that means if you play         |
| 56:41      | a lot like I do and you're not going to have Wi-Fi on the plane, you have to go through and open all    |
| 56:45      | your documents like while you're on Wi-Fi before you get on the plane, because otherwise you'll         |
| 56:49      | get on the plane and be like, well, this file didn't download and I can't work on it now.               |
| 56:52      | That's not very helpful. Yeah, it sucks. I mean, they both need to be fixed. But yeah,                  |
| 57:00      | so there's some automation you can do around this. But the other automation that I do is                |
| 57:04      | I do a lot of things with assist in that or Zapier, because I have things automatically                 |
| 57:10      | create folders for me or automatically add files based on certain things. And this is a really          |
| 57:16      | good way to kick stuff off because then I have, so for example, whenever I get assigned a new           |
| 57:20      | video at Screencast Online, one of the things that my Zapier Zap does is it creates a new               |
| 57:25      | folder in Dropbox for me. And then I know that I have that folder and that's where all of my            |
| 57:30      | documents can go. And that's where I'm now using post-haste to set stuff up so that stuff goes          |
| 57:34      | into that folder. But that folder has the correct name so that it's got the right show number and       |
| 57:39      | everything in that title. And that's in Dropbox. And then when I'm finished with it, then I can         |
| 57:44      | just untick it and it won't be synced on my machine anymore. Yeah, yeah. Nice. I find it very useful,   |
| 57:49      | especially in combination with other things like Keep for Maestro or [[Hazel]] to get stuff sorted out      |
| 57:55      | so you can have stuff just come into an inbox folder somewhere and then get moved. Well,                |
| 58:00      | I want to talk about cloud and automation when we get to a problem, so we're solving,                   |
| 58:06      | because that's something that's on my mind. Can I put a pin in that one for now? Well,                  |
| 58:10      | we've got a topic here about controlling your Mac from another device. What are you talking about       |
| 58:16      | with that one? Well, I have a Mac Mini and I love it and it's amazing. And one of the very              |
| 58:23      | many things I do with it is I leave it on pretty much all the time. So it's doing stuff in the          |
| 58:27      | background for me, like running [[Hazel]] stuff to tidy up my files or keep on my show macros to            |
| 58:33      | create folders and things like that for me. But that means that when I use it in the evening,           |
| 58:37      | it tends not to turn itself off. And if it's not muted, then you'll wake up at two o'clock in the       |
| 58:41      | morning and go, what was that ding? Oh, I got new email. And there's nothing worse than waking up       |
| 58:47      | at two o'clock in the morning because you got an email unless it's very, very, very important.          |
| 58:51      | And you don't want that. So what I do is I have some keyboard my show macros that will                  |
| 58:57      | sleep my displays or mute my machine. And I have an NFC tag next to my bed. And when I get into         |
| 59:04      | bed, I just have my phone on the NFC tag. And it does a bunch of things. It lowers the display          |
| 59:09      | brightness on my phone. And it makes sure that any timer toggle timers have been stopped. But           |
| 59:16      | what two of the things it does is it mutates my Mac and it tells us displays to go to sleep.            |
| 59:20      | So I don't have weird bright lights coming in from the front room because it turns up                   |
| 59:24      | by displays wrong full brightness while I'm asleep. And that just happens as part of my bedtime         |
| 59:30      | routine. And you're doing that through the [[Keyboard Maestro]] app? Yeah, no, I'm actually using the       |
| 59:35      | web hooks there to do this. So I just, so you can create macros in [[Keyboard Maestro]]. And you can        |
| 59:41      | say, let me trigger this via a web hook. And then you can just call open that URL essentially. And      |
| 59:48      | I do that with a get contents of URL. So it happens in the background. Yeah, makes sense. Makes         |
| 59:53      | sense. Although I would think that if you've got that remote machine, I would have a muted all the      |
| 59:57      | time. Why do you? The thing is, is it's not just, it's not just sitting around as a server. I use       |
| 01:00:02   | this, you know, it's got a lot of RAM and it's got a great processor. And I sit down at it and I edit   |
| 01:00:09   | video and audio and things like that before I send it off to people. And sometimes I'm doing this       |
| 01:00:14   | on speakers and sometimes you're using headphones. But if I unplug my headphones, because if you're     |
| 01:00:18   | editing video and audio, you probably want to plug in your headphones to avoid delay.                   |
| 01:00:24   | And so I then unplug my headphones and put them away. So the next time I go to podcast, I can           |
| 01:00:28   | just grab my headphone case, because I podcast on a different machine, but then I forget to             |
| 01:00:32   | mute my Mac. I could probably set something up that says, hey, if my headphones disconnect,             |
| 01:00:38   | you know, mute my Mac. But sometimes I don't want that. And so I just, I mute my Mac until it's         |
| 01:00:43   | displays to go to sleep every time I go to bed. And that works for me. That's an excellent example      |
| 01:00:49   | use of a webhook, by the way. Yeah, they do caution on the [[Keyboard Maestro]] instructions for this,      |
| 01:00:54   | that you should make sure it's doing something that isn't malicious. So it's not going to start         |
| 01:00:58   | deleting files on your machine, because it's, it is just calling a URL and it's security through        |
| 01:01:04   | obscurity. Yeah, anybody with that URL can trigger it. So exactly. So and I figure by,                  |
| 01:01:09   | by muting my machine and sleeping my displays, you know, it's not the end of the world. If              |
| 01:01:14   | somebody does find those URLs and figure that out, and I can regenerate them anyway, if I need to.      |
| 01:01:19   | So yeah, this is suddenly roses machine just starts turning dark and getting quiet,                     |
| 01:01:24   | like multiple times a day, then you probably need a new webhook.                                        |
| 01:01:27   | And I should also mention that I specifically have these macros in a group that only triggers on        |
| 01:01:31   | that machine. And so I have different groups in cable maestro. And I have four machines that I'm        |
| 01:01:38   | running keeping my straw on. I've got a couple of licenses running around for that. Yeah, four.         |
| 01:01:42   | I have two work machines and two personal machines. Okay, got you. It adds up pretty quickly when       |
| 01:01:48   | you have a laptop and a desktop and a laptop and a desktop. And two of them are not mine. I should      |
| 01:01:53   | point out to them do belong to work. But this, I have different groups. So those groups only            |
| 01:02:00   | trigger on those machines. And when you create a group, then you can, you can untick it and say,        |
| 01:02:04   | or take it and say disabled on this Mac. So the first thing I did was I created the group and           |
| 01:02:08   | said and disabled it on all of my Macs, which took a day because I had to remember that I had one,      |
| 01:02:14   | I had two work machines at work and I didn't go to work that day. So I had to wait another day,         |
| 01:02:18   | because I didn't want to accidentally be doing something to machines that I wasn't                      |
| 01:02:22   | intending to do that to when I run those macros. I would like to take a minute to talk about some       |
| 01:02:28   | of our favourite just automation utilities for the Mac. And the first one that we've mentioned many      |
| 01:02:35   | times throughout the show is CleanMyMac. It just, CleanMyMac does so much and they keep adding to       |
| 01:02:43   | it. You know, they now not only does it, you know, empty out your trash and look for, you know,         |
| 01:02:49   | translation files and look for large files. You can delete it even now looks for malicious              |
| 01:02:54   | software on your Mac for you. They, you know, they've just done such a great job of combining           |
| 01:02:59   | everything in one tool and building a user interface that just about anybody can use.                   |
| 01:03:05   | I mean, like I have installed CleanMyMac on relatives computers that are not, you know,                 |
| 01:03:10   | tech savvy. And it does a good job. It reminds them once a month that they need to run it. And          |
| 01:03:16   | when they run it, it does a good job of explaining it. And it, you know, it does my job for me.         |
| 01:03:21   | So whenever I go to Thanksgiving and I, I'm at their house, I don't have to like figure out what        |
| 01:03:26   | the problem is with their computer. A lot of times CleanMyMac is managed for me. But I also             |
| 01:03:31   | use it on my own because I think it's nice to have something doing this for me. Years ago,              |
| 01:03:35   | we used to talk about the maintenance scripts that used to have to run on a Mac, but CleanMyMac does    |
| 01:03:39   | so much more than all that stuff. So I think if there was one utility app, I'd recommend out of         |
| 01:03:44   | the show for automating the stuff it would be CleanMyMac. But Rose, I know you have a really            |
| 01:03:49   | cool automation app you would recommend too. Yeah, I use TripMode. And that's one that hasn't come      |
| 01:03:55   | up yet in this episode. But it's, again, it's available on set up as one of their, their apps,          |
| 01:04:02   | so you can buy it independently. And essentially what it does is you can say, hey, when I connect       |
| 01:04:06   | to this Wi-Fi network, throttle the data on my Mac and don't let this app or that app or the other      |
| 01:04:12   | app access the internet or only let these three apps access the internet. And this is really,           |
| 01:04:18   | really useful when you're tethering to your phone or you're on a hotel Wi-Fi and it's slow and,         |
| 01:04:23   | you know, especially if you're using a VPN for security reasons or because you need to access           |
| 01:04:28   | a particular network at work, that can slow things down even further if you're on a poor connection.    |
| 01:04:33   | And so it's really nice to be able to go through and just say, hey, no, you know what? I actually,      |
| 01:04:39   | I only need access to my, to Windows remote desktop, for example, or is it Microsoft remote             |
| 01:04:44   | desktop? They keep changing the name on me. And, and everything else does not get access                |
| 01:04:49   | while I'm on this network. And then you can turn that off later if you, if you're willing to go         |
| 01:04:54   | back to a slower internet, but it just really helps with making sure that you're only allowing          |
| 01:04:59   | internet access for the applications that you want. There is another application as well called         |
| 01:05:03   | Little Snitch, which can also do this, but it can be a lot more complex to set up. And I have to        |
| 01:05:08   | say I like Trip Mode just for its simplicity. Yeah. And I even use Trip Mode when I podcast,            |
| 01:05:12   | because I just, it automatically shuts off the background Dropbox sync and things like that.            |
| 01:05:17   | So there's all sorts of uses for it. Like if you are doing something we're banned with as King,         |
| 01:05:23   | even on a computer that's plugged into a wall and, you know, connected to the internet,                 |
| 01:05:28   | Trip Mode can have a use. I also find it's great because it remembers the networks as well. So          |
| 01:05:33   | if you connected to that network before and in you set up a preference, it will automatically do        |
| 01:05:38   | that for you. All right, I'm going to open up set up. Let me see if Trip Mode is on set up.             |
| 01:05:42   | It is. It is, of course. I don't, you know, this show is not sponsored by MacPaw, but it feels like it. |
| 01:05:52   | Actually, if you're looking for a Christmas present for somebody and they're a Mac user,                |
| 01:05:55   | you might want to consider getting them a couple of months of set up just because there are some        |
| 01:05:59   | really great apps in there. And it gives you an opportunity to explore stuff at a very affordable       |
| 01:06:03   | price. And I'm going to be getting set up for my dad for Christmas. My mom currently uses her Mac       |
| 01:06:08   | anymore. She's almost entirely iPad only, but my dad uses his Mac a lot and he's always interested      |
| 01:06:13   | in exploring new tools. And also it means that I get to install, clean my Mac on his machine and        |
| 01:06:18   | run some cleanup on there. Yeah, exactly. Hey, freelancers, do you want to save 192 hours?              |

| 01:07:21   | Okay. I always like to talk about some of the automation problems we're solving or working on.          |
| 01:07:27   | You got any this month, Russ? Oh, yes. I'm just looking at my shortcuts. And I've actually got a        |
| 01:07:33   | couple of little ones. And the first one is actually one that I made for Micah Sargent. He's a fellow    |
| 01:07:39   | host on Relay FM. He hosts Clockwise here. But he also hosts a couple of shows over on the             |
| 01:07:45   | Twitter network. And I was a guest on iOS today the other day. And one of the things that we did        |
| 01:07:51   | is we talked about a bunch of writing apps. And I had a ton of writing apps I wanted to talk about.     |
| 01:07:56   | And then I realised I had to find app store links for them and how much they cost. And I was there      |
| 01:08:01   | going, hmm, I can automate this. And I have to say I did automate this with shortcuts. And I just       |
| 01:08:07   | made a little shortcut. Yeah. The shortcut. Can I just say that the shortcuts app store automation      |
| 01:08:12   | is really powerful. Oh, it's so good. You can pull the icon out, you can get the links, everything.     |
| 01:08:17   | Exactly. Yeah. So you can do all of this. And I just thought that this was really useful because        |
| 01:08:22   | what you can do is in this case, we were filling in a spreadsheet. And so I just asked for the          |
| 01:08:30   | app store app split it into a bunch of rows because that's what it is. And went through each one,       |
| 01:08:35   | searched the app store, let you select it. And then on your clipboard at the end, it puts a nice        |
| 01:08:40   | list of the name of the app with a tab and then the price. And then at another tab and then the         |
| 01:08:46   | store URL. And that saved me so much time like opening the app store and copying the link and           |
| 01:08:52   | pasting the link and typing the price. Only I'm not in the US app store. So I would have had to         |
| 01:08:56   | log out of my app store and change your region and stuff like that. It would have been a lot of work    |
| 01:09:01   | to do that, but I did it in two minutes in shortcuts. Yeah, that's a nice one. Yeah. If you're doing    |
| 01:09:07   | anything involving the app store, you should take a minute to just look at the tools and shortcuts      |
| 01:09:13   | because you can literally do anything like I have a thing where when I'm working on an app that I       |
| 01:09:18   | want to write up a MacSparky, it pulls the the icon out and it just gets me a bunch of information     |
| 01:09:24   | on things that normally would would take a lot of manual clicks and drags. So it's really useful.       |
| 01:09:30   | I'll tell you the one I'm working on. I don't think I have this problem solved yet is I've decided      |
| 01:09:36   | I'm not really happy with my system for the law practice with clients because I have a lot of           |
| 01:09:43   | projects that I work on with clients where we've got a bunch of email and documents and notes and       |
| 01:09:48   | things going around. And then these transactions take, you know, sometimes somewhere between            |
| 01:09:53   | one and six months to finish. And then they're kind of like done. But then maybe two or three years     |
| 01:09:57   | later, they want to know, I mean, what did we do here? Or, you know, they want some specific about      |
| 01:10:02   | that old transaction. And historically, I would do that with a combination of [[Apple Mail]] and file       |
| 01:10:09   | and folder storage. And, you know, I'd have all the stuff in these different places. And I've           |
| 01:10:13   | decided I'm just going to put this stuff in base camp. You know, base camp is so good at keeping        |
| 01:10:17   | the stuff together. But base camp is a web tool. And it's not as automation friendly, like I can't      |
| 01:10:23   | make a [[Hazel]] rule necessarily to save stuff to the right folder in base camp. It's very manual          |
| 01:10:29   | when you go through it to create a folder, you have to click a button and type in the new name.         |
| 01:10:34   | And yeah, but I have been looking very carefully at some of the Zapier tools for base camp. And         |
| 01:10:40   | I'm starting to automate base camp to the best extent I can. There's still some things that             |
| 01:10:46   | are going to require some manual work. But, but the big problem being solved with this change,          |
| 01:10:50   | and I'm, you know, I'm trying to do it as we head into the new year to have this all in place,          |
| 01:10:55   | is, is worth the lack of automation for some of it. But I am finding through a combination of           |
| 01:11:03   | chewing gum and scotch tape that I'm actually being getting better at automating web service,           |
| 01:11:07   | which isn't the same set of tools you would use to automate a Mac.                                      |
| 01:11:11   | No, it's not. I have to say, I also do some things with base camp, some of the companies                |
| 01:11:16   | that I've been writing for use base camp to give us a big overview, especially with the                 |
| 01:11:22   | different boards and the different projects that we're working on. But as you mentioned,                |
| 01:11:26   | it's kind of difficult to automate, especially they use OAuth for authentication, which is a            |
| 01:11:32   | great protocol, nothing against OAuth, but it's something that you can't easily do in shortcuts,        |
| 01:11:36   | unless you set up something on your own server that can act as a gateway for one of a better work.      |
| 01:11:41   | Yeah. And I was not willing to do that. I can do that. I have the technical skills to do it,            |
| 01:11:46   | but I just can't be bothered. I have too many other things to do with my time.                          |
| 01:11:50   | So what I do is I use Zapier for that particular one. And I actually have [[Drafts]] ping Zapier,           |
| 01:11:57   | and it sends it a title and a link to a shared Dropbox folder, because I can't be bothered to           |
| 01:12:00   | figure out how to upload all the, I could upload the article content, no problem,                       |
| 01:12:06   | but the uploading the images as well is not something that I figured out how to do yet.                 |
| 01:12:10   | But if I put it in a Dropbox folder, as it turns out, that's easier because there's a                   |
| 01:12:14   | button in Dropbox where you can just say download everything. So that makes it easier for the other     |
| 01:12:19   | people involved as well. So I'm proxying that through Zapier, which works great for me, I have          |
| 01:12:25   | to say. It may not work perfectly for everybody, but for what I need it for, it definitely works.       |
| 01:12:30   | And Basecamp is starting to become more of a tool that I enjoy using.                                   |
| 01:12:33   | And it's setting up your own OAuth server. It's like, you know, that's going to break                   |
| 01:12:38   | after a month. And it's like it's going to be a constant project to keep that going.                    |
| 01:12:42   | So it's not even worth starting. I mean, I think one of the tricks of automation is knowing             |
| 01:12:48   | what holes not to go down. Yeah, definitely. I mean, as it is, I actually have been working             |
| 01:12:54   | on some authentication stuff at my day job recently. So I'm pretty certain I wouldn't                   |
| 01:12:58   | have a problem with it. But why would I do that when I can just proxy it through Zapier,                |
| 01:13:02   | which also adds everything to Airtable for me and does a bunch of other things all at the same          |
| 01:13:06   | time. And I should mention that Basecamp recently released a free personal plan for everybody.          |
| 01:13:11   | It was previously just for students and you had to send in proof of being a student.                    |
| 01:13:14   | Now it's for everybody. So everybody can have a play with Basecamp. And it's it's got a lot of          |
| 01:13:19   | automation options. It has webhooks and stuff. So you can do a lot of things with things like Zapier    |
| 01:13:24   | as well. Yeah, and I can see where, because I feel like in some ways it's like a regression for         |
| 01:13:30   | automation, because some of the stuff just is very manual. But for me, it's solving some problems       |
| 01:13:38   | that I just wasn't getting solved any other way. But that's where the automator superpowers come        |
| 01:13:43   | in handy when you see a challenge like they say, okay, well, where can I add automation                 |
| 01:13:47   | and make this a little easier? Definitely. And I have to say, it's one of these things where            |
| 01:13:52   | it's fun to actually sit down a little bit and play with these things, especially as it comes to        |
| 01:13:56   | the end of the year, you may not be feeling the most productive when you're sitting in the office       |
| 01:14:01   | or sitting in front of your computer if you don't have an office. And so it might be a good time        |
| 01:14:06   | to take that chance to sit down and go, hey, what can I set up automation wise ready for next year      |
| 01:14:11   | so that I can really make sure that next year is running the way it should.                             |
| 01:14:14   | Like I'll tell you one, here's a very simple one. I'm not even sure this qualifies as automation,       |
| 01:14:19   | but Basecamp has a very robust template system. So even though I can't automate generating folders,     |
| 01:14:28   | I've got like eight different templates for different types of client projects now.                     |
| 01:14:33   | And each one has an entire folder structure that it builds automatically as soon as I                   |
| 01:14:38   | create the project. And that is a form of automation, but just a little different than the way we       |
| 01:14:44   | typically talk about it on the automators. Yes. And it's a really good one. And                         |
| 01:14:49   | that's something that I'm working on as well. I was there trying to figure out the other day,           |
| 01:14:52   | how do I create an AppleScript that automatically creates a new mind node document. And then I         |
| 01:14:58   | realised I can just put a blank mind node document in post-haste and use it. And I don't need to        |
| 01:15:04   | automate it. So that's something I'm working on. And I'm hoping that I have that one ready to talk      |
| 01:15:08   | about in our what we've recently been working on part of our next episode. Maybe I'll need a couple     |
| 01:15:14   | more episodes to get there on that. Yeah. I mean, template documents are the ultimate automation        |
| 01:15:19   | that as you get more advanced automation, you neglect to do because it really isn't that hard.          |
| 01:15:27   | I create a new client file and depending on what type of company they are,                              |
| 01:15:32   | like a bunch of the documents I need to run that company are already made. It's just                    |
| 01:15:38   | that's the best automation. And then once you combine it with some of the stuff you can do              |
| 01:15:43   | in [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can actually just push a button and have it go in and customise each            |
| 01:15:47   | document. So it's pretty awesome. Yeah. And yeah, that if you're looking for a small place to get       |
| 01:15:53   | started, definitely templates. That's what you need. And that's great for Mac management as well,       |
| 01:15:58   | because you can have it automatically, you know, have a bunch of templates and use something like       |
| 01:16:02   | post-haste, which is very, very simple to set up. You create your structure once and then you           |
| 01:16:07   | you type in exactly what it is that you wanted to do and it just goes and it does it and it's           |
| 01:16:13   | very simple to understand. So that's a great way to get started. See, I'm aware of it because           |
| 01:16:19   | Don talked about it. I haven't downloaded it yet. I need to try post-haste, I guess.                    |
| 01:16:23   | I downloaded it and I have to confess that's one of the things that I'm setting up for my               |
| 01:16:27   | screencast online automation. Because if Don uses it for screencast online,                             |
| 01:16:31   | I can totally cheat and steal it from him, right? Is that one on set up? Probably.                      |
| 01:16:37   | No, but I think if I remember correctly, post-haste is actually free. I'm just double-checking that     |
| 01:16:41   | right now for everybody. Post-haste, digital rebellion. It's a free project management tool.            |
| 01:16:46   | There we go. It says write so in the Google description. It is free. I knew I downloaded                |
| 01:16:50   | it and installed it. I didn't remember paying for it. Well, I'm going to do that today.                 |
| 01:16:57   | There we go. Well, folks, that was kind of a lot of apps, I know, but we just wanted to talk about      |
| 01:17:03   | automators and managing your Mac. Hopefully, you got a few tips out of today's show.                    |
| 01:17:08   | Thank you to our sponsors, the folks over at Flatiron School, ExpressVPN, FreshBooks.                   |
| 01:17:14   | If you've got some Mac automation tricks that we didn't cover, there's a place you can talk about       |
| 01:17:19   | that, right, Rose? Yeah, there is. You can join us in our forums at talk.automators.fm,                 |
| 01:17:25   | where we will be delighted to hear all of your feedback on the show. It's a great place to              |
| 01:17:30   | share your automations with other automators listeners as well. There's links in the show notes,        |
| 01:17:34   | all the apps we talked about today, and we will see you in a couple of weeks. Goodbye, everybody.       |

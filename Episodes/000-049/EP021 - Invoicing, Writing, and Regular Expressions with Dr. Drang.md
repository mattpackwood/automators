| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to The Automators.                              |
| 00:03      | I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.       |
| 00:06      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                   |
| 00:07      | Hello, David. How are you today?                                   |
| 00:09      | I am doing great and we've got a guest today                       |
| 00:12      | that we've had some listeners asking us about.                     |
| 00:15      | I'm so happy to have him on the show.                              |
| 00:17      | Welcome to the show, Dr. Drang.                                    |
| 00:19      | Hello. Good to be here.                                            |
| 00:21      | Dr. Drang belongs to all of us.                                    |
| 00:24      | He is a fictional character on the Internet who writes             |
| 00:28      | really cool things about automation quite frequently.              |
| 00:32      | We've had him on the Mac Power users a couple of times,            |
| 00:35      | so we've got your origin story there,                              |
| 00:37      | but I want to talk about it there a little bit.                    |
| 00:39      | But before we do, I just have to tell you, Dr.,                    |
| 00:41      | that I had a vivid dream this morning.                             |
| 00:46      | You know how when you're waking up,                                |
| 00:49      | and those are the dreams I always remember.                        |
| 00:53      | I let the alarm go and I turned it off and I slept                 |
| 00:56      | like another 30 minutes, and in that 30 minutes,                   |
| 00:58      | I had a dream where on the show today,                             |
| 01:00      | I said your actual name.                                           |
| 01:02      | And because it was a dream, we didn't edit that out,               |
| 01:06      | and the entire Internet hated me for outing you.                   |
| 01:11      | I think a lot of the Internet already knows who I am,              |
| 01:15      | which is fine with me, but, you know.                              |
| 01:20      | I'm keeping it up because there's a history behind it now.         |
| 01:24      | Yeah, I think it's great, I think it's great.                      |
| 01:26      | And so folks who don't know Dr. Dreng,                             |
| 01:28      | he is a gentleman, a scientist, and a scholar,                     |
| 01:32      | and also a nerd who likes to program his Macs                      |
| 01:36      | and various iOS devices, and then he writes about it.              |
| 01:40      | And so many of us enjoy your posts                                 |
| 01:43      | because you may do a post about the reason                         |
| 01:46      | why a bolt failed on your lawn mower                               |
| 01:49      | or some really cool bit of Mac automation.                         |
| 01:51      | You just never know what you're gonna get                          |
| 01:54      | when you head over to leancrew.com.                                |
| 01:56      | So we all recommend you go check it out.                           |
| 02:00      | Well, thank you.                                                   |
| 02:01      | Yeah, I'm not really good at branding                              |
| 02:03      | or staying in my lane, as it were.                                 |
| 02:06      | Well, I think your lane is very much                               |
| 02:08      | the things that interest you.                                      |
| 02:09      | And somehow, I mean, I know nothing                                |
| 02:12      | about mechanics and engineering or any of these things,            |
| 02:15      | but whatever you write about,                                      |
| 02:16      | you always managed to write it in a way                            |
| 02:17      | that it's really interesting for me.                               |
| 02:19      | So I very much appreciate that.                                    |
| 02:22      | Well, thank you.                                                   |
| 02:23      | That's good.                                                       |
| 02:24      | That's nice to hear.                                               |
| 02:25      | I don't know if we've ever talked on a podcast before,             |
| 02:27      | but I also like the way you title your blog,                       |
| 02:29      | and now it's all this, you know,                                   |
| 02:31      | that famous John Lennon radio interview.                           |
| 02:34      | I don't know if everybody knows what that comes from.              |
| 02:36      | I guess we'll let you all go find that on your own.                |
| 02:39      | And that's okay with me, honestly.                                 |
| 02:43      | One of the things I don't do is,                                   |
| 02:46      | I do explain the scripts probably to excess,                       |
| 02:49      | but I leave a lot of things unsaid,                                |
| 02:53      | and unlinked too, because discovery is fun.                        |
| 02:56      | Yeah, exactly.                                                     |
| 02:57      | I would just like to make a note here in the podcast               |
| 03:00      | that when I type in,                                               |
| 03:00      | and now it's all this on doc.doc.go,                               |
| 03:03      | leancrew.com comes up first.                                       |
| 03:05      | So you are definitely doing great marketing there.                 |
| 03:09      | Well, then I've got that brand.                                    |
| 03:10      | Okay, I'm better than I thought.                                   |
| 03:12      | Wow, you're ahead of John Lennon.                                  |
| 03:13      | Yeah, I have to type in John Lennon at the end                     |
| 03:15      | to get the recording, so.                                          |
| 03:19      | Yeah, there is, though, a problem here,                            |
| 03:21      | because, okay, so my fictional name is one thing.                  |
| 03:24      | The name of my blog, or the URL of the blog,                       |
| 03:27      | is another thing,                                                  |
| 03:28      | and the name of the blog is a completely different thing.          |
| 03:30      | That's really not,                                                 |
| 03:31      | that's not the way you're supposed to do things.                   |
| 03:32      | No, man, you got it all wrong.                                     |
| 03:34      | I mean, Madison Avenue would be very upset with you.               |
| 03:38      | Yeah, well, lucky me.                                              |
| 03:40      | But we all love you,                                               |
| 03:41      | because you bring some great automation stuff.                     |
| 03:43      | We got some specific automations                                   |
| 03:45      | we're gonna share with you in today's show,                        |
| 03:47      | and I feel like this is right in the wheelhouse                    |
| 03:50      | of this show, I love talking to people                             |
| 03:52      | about how they've solved a unique,                                 |
| 03:54      | or not so unique, problem with automation,                         |
| 03:56      | what they were thinking, and how they pulled it off,               |
| 03:58      | and hopefully we can inspire a few of the listeners                |
| 04:01      | to take off.                                                       |
| 04:03      | The ones we're gonna cover today,                                  |
| 04:04      | we're not gonna get there just yet,                                |
| 04:05      | but we're gonna talk about the way you're automating               |
| 04:08      | your invoicing and some of the cool stuff                          |
| 04:10      | you're doing on iOS with [[Drafts]].                                   |
| 04:12      | But before we do that, I just wanna,                               |
| 04:14      | we've talked to you on Mac Power users,                            |
| 04:16      | like I said, I'm gonna link those shows in this show as well.      |
| 04:19      | But just tell me a little bit about                                |
| 04:22      | how you got started with computers,                                |
| 04:24      | because you and I are of an age                                    |
| 04:26      | where we got to kind of see all this come together.                |
| 04:29      | Yeah, well, I started the way I think most people,                 |
| 04:33      | my age got started, which is I didn't have                         |
| 04:36      | a personal computer until I was in my 20s,                         |
| 04:41      | and because they weren't really around much.                       |
| 04:44      | There were some around when I was in my teens,                     |
| 04:46      | but what was the point of that?                                    |
| 04:50      | So my first work with computers was                                |
| 04:54      | when I was a freshman in college,                                  |
| 04:55      | and I took the introductory programming course                     |
| 04:57      | that all engineers took, which was Fortran.                        |
| 05:00      | And this is far enough back that I had to learn                    |
| 05:05      | how to use a key punch machine,                                    |
| 05:06      | because all of our programs were submitted with punch cards,       |
| 05:11      | and this was all done on the mainframe, of course.                 |
| 05:15      | And so you would write your program out on paper,                  |
| 05:21      | in fact, because Fortran was very picky                            |
| 05:23      | about the columns you started in and things like that.             |
| 05:28      | There was special paper that we had.                               |
| 05:30      | It was very wide paper,                                            |
| 05:32      | and you would fill in a character per grid.                        |
| 05:34      | There was a grid system,                                           |
| 05:35      | and so you write your program out on that.                         |
| 05:39      | Eventually, actually pretty quickly,                               |
| 05:41      | you'd get tired of doing it that way,                              |
| 05:43      | but that's how you started.                                        |
| 05:44      | And then you'd go to the key punch machine,                        |
| 05:46      | and you'd wait around in the key punch area                        |
| 05:48      | until somebody, one was open,                                      |
| 05:49      | and you'd go in there and you'd grab it,                           |
| 05:51      | and you'd type things out, and you'd get a stack of cards,         |
| 05:53      | and then you'd take the cards over to a little desk                |
| 05:56      | and deliver it, and then you'd wait around                         |
| 05:58      | to get a print out, which typically showed                         |
| 06:01      | that your program failed somewhere,                                |
| 06:02      | and you'd have to try to figure out why it failed,                 |
| 06:04      | and then you'd go back and do this,                                |
| 06:06      | change a card here or there, and do it again,                      |
| 06:10      | and do it again, and do it again,                                  |
| 06:11      | until eventually your program ran.                                 |
| 06:13      | This was not a very efficient process.                             |
| 06:16      | As you're saying that, I'm thinking about the other day            |
| 06:18      | I was talking to a nerd friend,                                    |
| 06:19      | and I just went on this rant about tags in iOS                     |
| 06:23      | and how it's so much scrolling,                                    |
| 06:24      | and poor me, special snowflake,                                    |
| 06:28      | I don't wanna scroll so much to get to my tags,                    |
| 06:30      | and I was thinking, oh yeah, when we started this,                 |
| 06:33      | we were using punch cards.                                         |
| 06:35      | Well, it's still a valid complaint to complain                     |
| 06:39      | about how much we have to scroll                                   |
| 06:40      | to either find our shortcuts, or find tags,                        |
| 06:43      | or find anything, you know, no, it's still awful.                  |
| 06:47      | It's all, computers have always been awful,                        |
| 06:48      | and they will always remain awful.                                 |
| 06:50      | Often user hostile, often.                                         |
| 06:53      | Yes, yes.                                                          |
| 06:54      | So did you have any automation                                     |
| 06:56      | that would help you if you dropped all of your punch cards?        |
| 06:58      | Because I know people do that,                                     |
| 07:00      | you would drop all of your punch cards,                            |
| 07:01      | and then they'd all be out of order.                               |
| 07:03      | Did you have any system to help you get around that?               |
| 07:06      | No, that's when you just quit                                      |
| 07:07      | and went to art school, right?                                     |
| 07:09      | That's right, no.                                                  |
| 07:11      | I don't know of any way to fix that.                               |
| 07:13      | The real, the key thing was, I mean, all of my cards,              |
| 07:19      | I could reorder, because the programs                              |
| 07:22      | weren't really that long.                                          |
| 07:24      | But there were the special job control language,                   |
| 07:29      | the JCL cards that had to go in front                              |
| 07:32      | that were magical, and which,                                      |
| 07:35      | because we were learning Fortran, the teachers,                    |
| 07:38      | we didn't, I never learned JCL.                                    |
| 07:40      | These were just magic cards                                        |
| 07:42      | that I stuck in the front all the time.                            |
| 07:44      | And I never knew what order they were supposed to be in.           |
| 07:47      | I just kept them in the order that they were,                      |
| 07:49      | and God forbid, luckily, they never got out of order.              |
| 07:56      | So I don't know.                                                   |
| 07:57      | There obviously were terrible stories                              |
| 07:59      | about people who dropped their cards,                              |
| 08:02      | who had real substantial programs,                                 |
| 08:04      | and that's a nightmare.                                            |
| 08:06      | I mean, you might as well just start over again.                   |
| 08:09      | It was terrible.                                                   |
| 08:09      | So this is the story of how David ended up                         |
| 08:11      | in law school versus in programmer school, right?                  |
| 08:13      | Yeah, I guess.                                                     |
| 08:16      | I don't know.                                                      |
| 08:17      | I mean, my problem, my whole life has been,                        |
| 08:19      | I don't have enough discipline to do one thing,                    |
| 08:21      | and let's just leave it at that.                                   |
| 08:23      | That's a good thing.                                               |
| 08:25      | But you eventually, you worked through                             |
| 08:27      | the usual suspects, Pascal, Basic, you know,                       |
| 08:31      | that was the start for me,                                         |
| 08:33      | Basic writing at 10 speed to Radio Shack                           |
| 08:35      | and programming their computers.                                   |
| 08:37      | That's how I got started.                                          |
| 08:39      | And I used Basic first, not the way most people did.               |
| 08:43      | I didn't use it.                                                   |
| 08:44      | I didn't program personal computers in Basic.                      |
| 08:47      | I actually program mainframes in Basic                             |
| 08:50      | because a particular class that I was taking                       |
| 08:53      | wanted us to do finite difference solutions                        |
| 08:57      | to differential equations.                                         |
| 08:59      | And Basic had, the Basic that was on a mainframe                   |
| 09:04      | had a matrix inversion command that was great                      |
| 09:11      | if you were into numerical analysis.                               |
| 09:13      | It was just one command.                                           |
| 09:14      | I think it was INV.                                                |
| 09:16      | And so that's why we did our programming                           |
| 09:20      | in that class in Basic.                                            |
| 09:22      | I had already learned Pascal, the Pascal class,                    |
| 09:24      | which I took as a senior, was probably the class,                  |
| 09:28      | that was the class where I learned structured programming.         |
| 09:30      | That was the paradigm at the time.                                 |
| 09:32      | This is the very late 70s, early 80s.                              |
| 09:36      | And that was really where I learned                                |
| 09:37      | how to break up a program into different,                          |
| 09:43      | what were called procedures and functions in Pascal.               |
| 09:47      | And be a little bit better about naming variables                  |
| 09:51      | and things like that.                                              |
| 09:52      | So I would say that's where I really learned programming,          |
| 09:55      | was in that Pascal class, not in the Fortran class.                |
| 09:58      | And how did you get started with automation?                       |
| 10:01      | These classes were all very directed                               |
| 10:05      | toward answering engineering problems,                             |
| 10:08      | not answering office work type problems.                           |
| 10:12      | So I started automation probably in the mid to late 80s            |
| 10:18      | after I had a job.                                                 |
| 10:20      | And it was with HyperCard.                                         |
| 10:23      | When HyperCard came out, I went all in on HyperCard                |
| 10:28      | and HyperTalk, the language behind HyperCard.                      |
| 10:33      | And I believe I even made some HyperTalk external commands         |
| 10:37      | that I programmed either in Pascal                                 |
| 10:39      | or possibly even assembly language to do a couple of things.       |
| 10:43      | That was kind of hazy with time on that.                           |
| 10:46      | But so there in the mid to late 80s,                               |
| 10:52      | I don't remember exactly when HyperCard came out,                  |
| 10:54      | but I had all my contacts in HyperCard.                            |
| 10:59      | I had my calendar in HyperCard.                                    |
| 11:04      | My Mac would start up in HyperCard,                                |
| 11:07      | not in the Finder.                                                 |
| 11:09      | Back in those days, you could do,                                  |
| 11:10      | there was no multi Finder back in those days.                      |
| 11:15      | You know, it was one process at a time,                            |
| 11:17      | sort of like the way when the iPad came out.                       |
| 11:20      | So I launched applications from within HyperCard.                  |
| 11:25      | It was, as I said, I went all in on it.                            |
| 11:29      | And I used it for several years that way.                          |
| 11:32      | I dialed my phone from HyperCard,                                  |
| 11:36      | from my contacts database that was inside it.                      |
| 11:39      | It was a wonderful program.                                        |
| 11:41      | It was a wonderful programming environment.                        |
| 11:45      | One that I, lots of people who are of our age                      |
| 11:49      | and who cut their teeth on HyperCard, miss it greatly.             |
| 11:53      | It was a spectacular programming environment.                      |
| 11:56      | You know, when you say HyperCard, I just smile.                    |
| 11:59      | I mean, I don't know anybody that you started with HyperCard       |
| 12:02      | that doesn't love that application.                                |
| 12:06      | Yeah, nobody hated HyperCard.                                      |
| 12:08      | It was great.                                                      |
| 12:10      | I mean, it was, and it just like opened the world to me.           |
| 12:12      | I mean, in terms of things you could do with a Macintosh.          |
| 12:16      | Years ago, well, not, I mean, a few years ago,                     |
| 12:19      | back when Mac World was a thing,                                   |
| 12:21      | one year, Bill Atkinson was there.                                 |
| 12:22      | And, you know, and everybody was like swooning over him.           |
| 12:27      | And to me, you know, the biggest contribution he ever made         |
| 12:30      | was HyperCard.                                                     |
| 12:31      | He's the guy behind HyperCard, as well as Mac Paint.               |
| 12:34      | And I think he did Mac Right too.                                  |
| 12:36      | I mean.                                                            |
| 12:37      | He didn't do Mac Right, but he did do,                             |
| 12:40      | he did all of the graphics                                         |
| 12:42      | of what was called the Macintosh Toolbox.                          |
| 12:44      | So everything that was in the ROM of the Mac                       |
| 12:47      | in those early days, that was all him.                             |
| 12:50      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 12:50      | I mean, he's the one that when they brought on                     |
| 12:52      | the productivity expert at Apple,                                  |
| 12:55      | who wanted the programmers to turn in                              |
| 12:56      | the number of lines of code they wrote every week.                 |
| 12:59      | Yeah, he wrote, and you know, he turned in a report                |
| 13:02      | that he wrote negative like 10,000 lines of code                   |
| 13:05      | because he solved a problem                                        |
| 13:06      | and was able to delete a bunch of code.                            |
| 13:09      | Yes.                                                               |
| 13:10      | And I think the story was they stopped asking after that           |
| 13:13      | because he made his point.                                         |
| 13:14      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 13:15      | No, he was an astounding programmer                                |
| 13:17      | and a guy who wasn't trained as a programmer.                      |
| 13:19      | Cause back in those days, you know,                                |
| 13:22      | programmers did not necessarily come out with CS degrees.          |
| 13:24      | Just as an aside story, he's a wonderfully very nice guy.          |
| 13:30      | He's a photographer now.                                           |
| 13:32      | And he had an app for a while in the app store.                    |
| 13:35      | And the year I met him was the year                                |
| 13:37      | they had announced the iPad,                                       |
| 13:38      | but at Mac World it wasn't out yet.                                |
| 13:41      | And I said, well, I said,                                          |
| 13:43      | I bet you're looking forward to getting your hands on one.         |
| 13:45      | And he says, oh no, I already played with Steve's.                 |
| 13:47      | That's what he said to me.                                         |
| 13:49      | Hmm.                                                               |
| 13:51      | That's showing off.                                                |
| 13:53      | I like that.                                                       |
| 13:54      | You know what, I kind of felt like it was,                         |
| 13:55      | but I kind of pulled it out of him.                                |
| 13:57      | He didn't like go there immediately.                               |
| 13:58      | So I'm going to give that one to him.                              |
| 14:01      | Anyway, the HyperCard was amazing.                                 |
| 14:03      | In fact, I always feel like, you know,                             |
| 14:05      | and you may disagree with me later.                                |
| 14:06      | I feel like Siri Shortcuts is kind of a modern version             |
| 14:10      | of HyperCard in a lot of ways.                                     |
| 14:12      | Yeah, well, you and I have, we'll get into this.                   |
| 14:16      | Yeah, it's a good one.                                             |
| 14:18      | I'm shortcuts as you are,                                          |
| 14:20      | which may be getting me banned from this podcast later on,         |
| 14:24      | but we'll see how it is.                                           |
| 14:25      | We're never banning this.                                          |
| 14:26      | No, man, let's just be clear.                                      |
| 14:28      | Yeah, yeah.                                                        |
| 14:29      | And so then there was sort of like a fallow period                 |
| 14:32      | where I wasn't doing a lot of automation.                          |
| 14:35      | And then when I abandoned the Mac for Linux                        |
| 14:39      | in the late 90s, then automation really came back                  |
| 14:44      | because everything you do in a [[Unix]] environment                    |
| 14:47      | is scripting to some extent or another,                            |
| 14:50      | and you really don't use [[Unix]] properly                             |
| 14:52      | unless you're doing some kind of scripting.                        |
| 14:54      | And that's when I started doing,                                   |
| 14:56      | I learned a little bit of bash.                                    |
| 14:58      | I can't script in bash.                                            |
| 14:59      | It doesn't, my brain doesn't work that way.                        |
| 15:04      | It's index is just awful, but I learned Perl.                      |
| 15:08      | And people think Perl syntax is terrible.                          |
| 15:11      | No, Perl syntax is actually not bad at all.                        |
| 15:14      | You just have to work with it.                                     |
| 15:18      | I used Perl for several years,                                     |
| 15:19      | and then of course then I went into Python,                        |
| 15:21      | which is what I program in today,                                  |
| 15:24      | and do most of my automation in if I can.                          |
| 15:28      | I've been encountering Perl at work, let's say.                    |
| 15:30      | I've not written anything in Perl,                                 |
| 15:32      | but there are a lot of scripts written in Perl running around.     |
| 15:34      | And I have to say, as somebody who's, you know,                    |
| 15:37      | my first programming experience as programming language            |
| 15:40      | was Java, not JavaScript Java.                                     |
| 15:43      | And as somebody who started with that, looking at Perl,            |
| 15:46      | it's actually, you know,                                           |
| 15:48      | I don't know why it's got this bad reputation,                     |
| 15:51      | but I quite like it.                                               |
| 15:52      | It's very readable.                                                |
| 15:53      | The problem comes in because a lot of, I think,                    |
| 15:57      | because a lot of Perl uses regular expressions.                    |
| 16:00      | It's one of the great features of Perl,                            |
| 16:02      | there are regular expressions.                                     |
| 16:04      | And regular expressions can just look awful.                       |
| 16:06      | I mean, they're very, they're terse.                               |
| 16:09      | They're great for programming in because they are terse,           |
| 16:11      | because they are so very expressive                                |
| 16:14      | in a short number of characters,                                   |
| 16:17      | but that also makes it hard to read.                               |
| 16:18      | That's why Perl has gotten the reputation of line noise.           |
| 16:22      | But that's just regular expressions, that's not Perl,              |
| 16:24      | because regular expressions look horrible                          |
| 16:25      | in every language.                                                 |
| 16:28      | Or at least you can't.                                             |
| 16:29      | Is there Perl without regular expressions though, really?          |
| 16:33      | I don't know.                                                      |
| 16:33      | Maybe.                                                             |
| 16:34      | I'm not sure I ever,                                               |
| 16:35      | I'm not sure I ever wrote a program in Perl                        |
| 16:37      | that didn't have regular expressions in it.                        |
| 16:40      | And, you know, we talk often on this show                          |
| 16:42      | about for folks who don't make their living programming,           |
| 16:45      | where, but you want to get better at automation,                   |
| 16:48      | what are some things you can do to get better?                     |
| 16:50      | And I've never really got on this horse publicly before,           |
| 16:54      | but I do think as much as people make fun                          |
| 16:57      | of regular expressions, they're not that hard to learn             |
| 17:01      | and they can come in super handy                                   |
| 17:03      | if you like to automate things.                                    |
| 17:05      | They're fantastic.                                                 |
| 17:07      | And the key is you learn them a little bit at a time.              |
| 17:11      | You don't try to absorb the whole thing at once.                   |
| 17:16      | You don't start going into negative look ahead                     |
| 17:19      | right from day one.                                                |
| 17:20      | You learn about, you know, what are the special characters         |
| 17:25      | and what does the star mean and what does the dot mean             |
| 17:27      | and what does a plus mean?                                         |
| 17:29      | And then you slowly get up and closing things                      |
| 17:33      | in square brackets and character classes.                          |
| 17:38      | That's how you do it.                                              |
| 17:39      | As you learn almost anything,                                      |
| 17:41      | you try to start with the simplest stuff                           |
| 17:44      | and then you move on and you slowly build things up.               |
| 17:48      | And there was a sort of a back and forth kind of thread            |
| 17:54      | with [[Jason Snell]] wrote a post                                      |
| 17:57      | and I wrote kind of a response post to it                          |
| 18:00      | about regular expressions.                                         |
| 18:01      | And Gruber may have gotten involved in it as well.                 |
| 18:04      | I mean, they are just wonderful things                             |
| 18:08      | that increase your power tremendously.                             |
| 18:11      | They give you leverage.                                            |
| 18:12      | I skipped over it.                                                 |
| 18:14      | If you're listening, you have no idea what I'm talking about       |
| 18:16      | when I say regular expressions.                                    |
| 18:18      | It's basically a search language.                                  |
| 18:20      | You know, you do find in your word processor,                      |
| 18:24      | you say find a word that has this in it                            |
| 18:26      | with regular expressions,                                          |
| 18:28      | you can make that much, much smarter.                              |
| 18:32      | I guess, is that a good way to summarise?                          |
| 18:33      | How would you summarise it?                                        |
| 18:34      | Yeah, it's generalising the idea of finding.                       |
| 18:37      | And so instead of finding a particular, you know,                  |
| 18:40      | C-A-T everywhere in your file,                                     |
| 18:45      | you can look at C, then a vowel and then T                         |
| 18:51      | or C-A-T possibly with an S after it,                              |
| 18:56      | but possibly not with an S after it.                               |
| 18:58      | And you can look for C-A-T case sensitive                          |
| 19:02      | or not case sensitive always.                                      |
| 19:04      | Most search tools will do that                                     |
| 19:07      | even without regular expressions.                                  |
| 19:09      | It's expanding the idea of what search and replace does.           |
| 19:14      | I often use it when I'm using,                                     |
| 19:16      | searching for things that have sequential members in it            |
| 19:18      | because there's placeholders in it                                 |
| 19:20      | that say any three numbers, it doesn't matter which ones,          |
| 19:23      | you know, and then you can find the files                          |
| 19:26      | that may have some, you know,                                      |
| 19:27      | some declaration at the beginning                                  |
| 19:29      | and then three numbers afterwards.                                 |
| 19:31      | You find any three, you know, it's just,                           |
| 19:33      | and like Dr. Drang was saying,                                     |
| 19:35      | if you're ever doing searches and you realise,                     |
| 19:37      | hey, this is a lot harder or the tools I have                      |
| 19:40      | aren't strong enough to find what I need,                          |
| 19:43      | that's a great opportunity to go into regular expressions.         |
| 19:46      | And there are online resources to help you learn those.            |
| 19:50      | And once you have that tool in your belt,                          |
| 19:51      | you find all sorts of uses for it in automation.                   |
| 19:55      | Definitely.                                                        |
| 19:56      | There are online regular expression,                               |
| 19:59      | apart from learning how to use them,                               |
| 20:01      | there are also online regular expression testers.                  |
| 20:06      | So you can give it some text,                                      |
| 20:08      | try out your regular expression                                    |
| 20:10      | before you destroy your text,                                      |
| 20:12      | and see experiment with, you know,                                 |
| 20:16      | well, what does this regular expression find?                      |
| 20:18      | What does this one find?                                           |
| 20:20      | And so on.                                                         |
| 20:20      | I think there's even, and I haven't looked into this,              |
| 20:23      | so I'm kind of talking sideways here,                              |
| 20:26      | but I believe there's even apps in the app store                   |
| 20:28      | that will teach you regular expressions,                           |
| 20:30      | you know, kind of walk you through.                                |
| 20:32      | So there are.                                                      |
| 20:32      | Well, that was a little bit of a side thing there,                 |
| 20:34      | but we've never come, the subject's never come up,                 |
| 20:37      | but I think it's something                                         |
| 20:38      | that automators should definitely put on their list.               |
| 20:41      | Yeah, well, discursive talk is my middle name.                     |
| 20:43      | Yes.                                                               |
| 20:46      | Well, I want to talk about some of the automation                  |
| 20:48      | you're doing right now,                                            |
| 20:50      | but first, let's hear from our first sponsor.                      |
| 20:54      | This episode of Automators is brought to you                       |
| 20:56      | by our awesome friends at Luna Display,                            |
| 20:59      | the only hardware solution that turns your iPad                    |
| 21:02      | into a wireless display for your Mac.                              |
| 21:04      | Use promo code AUTOMATORS at checkout for 10% off.                 |
| 21:09      | Luna Display is a little piece of hardware                         |
| 21:11      | that plugs into your Mac.                                          |
| 21:13      | Once you set it up, you can use your iPad                          |
| 21:15      | as a second display that's super portable                          |
| 21:18      | with basically zero lag and a gorgeous image quality.              |
| 21:23      | Setting up extra screens can be fiddly,                            |
| 21:25      | but Luna Display couldn't be easier.                               |
| 21:27      | Just plug in the piece of hardware in your Mac                     |
| 21:29      | and you're good to go.                                             |
| 21:30      | Plus everything works over WiFi.                                   |
| 21:33      | But you're a busy person,                                          |
| 21:34      | so you might be traveling without a WiFi connection.               |
| 21:37      | No worries, just connect with USB.                                 |
| 21:40      | It's super simple to get set up                                    |
| 21:41      | and you'll love that extra screen real estate.                     |
| 21:44      | I usually have my big iPad Pro sitting right next                  |
| 21:48      | to my iMac.                                                        |
| 21:49      | With the Luna Display now,                                         |
| 21:50      | I just have to tap one button to make that display                 |
| 21:53      | into a secondary monitor.                                          |
| 21:56      | It's great when you need some off-screen reference.                |
| 21:58      | For instance, right now as I record this podcast,                  |
| 22:01      | I've got Luna Display showing all my recording tools.              |
| 22:04      | That way I can look at my big screen                               |
| 22:06      | and focus on the content for you, dear listener,                   |
| 22:09      | but at the same time be a professional podcaster                   |
| 22:12      | and make sure that I actually did press the record button.         |
| 22:15      | Luna Display is a complete extension to your Mac.                  |
| 22:18      | It supports external keyboards,                                    |
| 22:20      | as well as Apple Pencil and touch interactions.                    |
| 22:23      | It basically turns your Mac into a touch screen device             |
| 22:26      | and the all new liquid video engine                                |
| 22:28      | brings significantly reduced latency                               |
| 22:30      | and faster screen refresh rates.                                   |
| 22:33      | Listeners of Automators can get                                    |

| 23:01      | and all of Relay FM.                                               |
| 23:05      | Dr. Dreing, you recently did a post                                |
| 23:07      | about the various iterations of your automation                    |
| 23:11      | and your invoicing system.                                         |
| 23:13      | And I thought it was kind of fascinating                           |
| 23:16      | the way it's evolved over the years.                               |
| 23:17      | And I was wondering if you could share some of that with us.       |
| 23:20      | Yeah, this is, in one way or another,                              |
| 23:23      | I have been invoicing,                                             |
| 23:25      | automating my invoicing and sort of project tracking system.       |
| 23:33      | System might be a too strong a word for over 20 years.             |
| 23:38      | And things have changed over those 20 years.                       |
| 23:42      | And so there are a few parts to it.                                |
| 23:46      | And this is a system that has obviously evolved.                   |
| 23:51      | It didn't just spring out of my head                               |
| 23:54      | like Athena from the head of Zeus.                                 |
| 23:56      | It fully formed.                                                   |
| 23:58      | No, it's something that you build up over time.                    |
| 24:00      | And that's the way a lot of automation systems work                |
| 24:03      | is that you get an idea about,                                     |
| 24:06      | first you've done something repetitively                           |
| 24:08      | and you think, well,                                               |
| 24:09      | I don't want to do this repetitively anymore.                      |
| 24:11      | I want to automate it.                                             |
| 24:13      | And then you start automating certain things.                      |
| 24:14      | And usually you start off by kind of mimicking                     |
| 24:17      | the way you do it by hand.                                         |
| 24:18      | That's usually not a great way.                                    |
| 24:20      | It's a good way to start,                                          |
| 24:21      | but it's usually not the best way to automate it.                  |
| 24:23      | And then you learn, oh no, I can do it a different way.            |
| 24:25      | And then you find another thing.                                   |
| 24:27      | Well, I have to prep certain things                                |
| 24:30      | to get that automation to run right.                               |
| 24:32      | Maybe I can automate the prep work too.                            |
| 24:33      | And things expand.                                                 |
| 24:35      | And then, so my invoicing system,                                  |
| 24:40      | as I say, started back when I was using Linux.                     |
| 24:45      | And this was back when we had paper invoices                       |
| 24:48      | coming out of my company's invoicing system,                       |
| 24:53      | our accounting system.                                             |
| 24:54      | And I would make a paper cover letter to go with it                |
| 24:58      | and stick it in an envelope and put a stamp on it                  |
| 25:02      | and so forth and send it off.                                      |
| 25:04      | So I automated the cover letter to,                                |
| 25:08      | it was very much like,                                             |
| 25:10      | this was not much more than a TextExpander kind of thing,         |
| 25:12      | except because I was in Linux and it was 1997,                     |
| 25:16      | I wasn't, there was no TextExpander.                              |
| 25:20      | I wrote a Perl script that would make a billing letter for me.     |
| 25:25      | And when I came back to the Mac,                                   |
| 25:27      | I started changing things around and things,                       |
| 25:30      | we shifted to, I shifted to email, emailing my invoices            |
| 25:35      | that were PDFs to the client.                                      |
| 25:38      | And so my system in a nutshell is this.                            |
| 25:45      | First, there is the new project script.                            |
| 25:48      | So when I write up and when I get a new project                    |
| 25:52      | from a client, this is something that runs                         |
| 25:54      | still entirely on the Mac.                                         |
| 25:56      | I haven't expanded it to be able to work on iOS yet,               |
| 26:00      | but I enter the information, it basically prompts me,              |
| 26:05      | who's the client, what's the project name,                         |
| 26:07      | that sort of thing.                                                |
| 26:09      | And it makes a database entry for me                               |
| 26:12      | in a database that I have locally on my machine.                   |
| 26:16      | Well, I'm also using, what's it called, Airtable.                  |
| 26:21      | I have both Airtable and an SQLite database.                       |
| 26:27      | I'm actually doing things in parallel.                             |
| 26:30      | Rose, have you noticed how often Airtable comes up lately?         |
| 26:33      | Something tells me we're gonna need an episode on this, right?     |
| 26:35      | Everybody's using Airtable, yeah, anyway.                          |
| 26:38      | Yeah, I'm kind of, on this, I'm still keeping it there.            |
| 26:43      | I'm starting to use it a little bit less                           |
| 26:45      | for this particular one,                                           |
| 26:46      | but yeah, Airtable is a lovely thing.                              |
| 26:48      | And so it does that, it makes two database entries                 |
| 26:52      | and two different databases because I'm redundant.                 |
| 26:55      | It makes a mail folder in mail                                     |
| 26:58      | because I have to organise my email                                |
| 27:01      | by the jobs that I am working on.                                  |
| 27:04      | And then it makes a subdirectory                                   |
| 27:07      | with the name of the project.                                      |
| 27:09      | And then within that, it makes some other folders                  |
| 27:13      | for photographs that I might take on the project,                  |
| 27:16      | invoices and other things.                                         |
| 27:20      | So that's one thing.                                               |
| 27:23      | Then when an invoice comes out,                                    |
| 27:24      | I have the invoice as a PDF and I run another script               |
| 27:28      | and that does a few things.                                        |
| 27:29      | First, it attaches any expense reports                             |
| 27:32      | associated with that invoice to it.                                |
| 27:35      | It attaches a W9 from my company to it.                            |
| 27:39      | Then it creates an email cover letter.                             |
| 27:42      | It attaches the invoice,                                           |
| 27:47      | which now has the expense report and the W9 appended to it.        |
| 27:51      | It attaches that to the cover letter                               |
| 27:53      | and gives some sort of boilerplate language                        |
| 27:55      | about here is invoice number such and such,                        |
| 28:00      | it's for X number of dollars on this project, please pay.          |
| 28:05      | And then the script then adds a reminder to me.                    |
| 28:16      | In reminders, I have an invoice list in reminders                  |
| 28:21      | and it adds one reminding me to follow up                          |
| 28:25      | on this invoice in roughly 45 days                                 |
| 28:31      | if it hasn't been paid.                                            |
| 28:32      | And that's actually, there's a bit of fun calendar                 |
| 28:38      | scripting in there, cause I like scripting calendar stuff.         |
| 28:41      | It actually follows up, it will remind me to follow up             |
| 28:45      | on the first Tuesday that happens,                                 |
| 28:47      | either 45 days or more afterward.                                  |
| 28:50      | And I chose Tuesday because it's weekday,                          |
| 28:52      | it's early in the week and it's almost never a holiday.            |
| 28:56      | And it's just that way, all my follow up happens                   |
| 28:58      | on the same day every week.                                        |
| 28:59      | And I don't have to think about following up within voices.        |
| 29:03      | And so when I get that reminder,                                   |
| 29:07      | I have to send out a new letter,                                   |
| 29:10      | an email to the client saying,                                     |
| 29:12      | hey, how come you haven't paid?                                    |
| 29:14      | And this is now also run by a script.                              |
| 29:18      | It's actually, fundamentally it's a Taskpaper,                    |
| 29:22      | I'm sorry, a [[Keyboard Maestro]] action                               |
| 29:27      | that runs every Tuesday morning,                                   |
| 29:29      | looks through my reminders,                                        |
| 29:31      | figures out which ones are due today,                              |
| 29:34      | creates an email for each one of them,                             |
| 29:38      | a follow up email saying,                                          |
| 29:40      | hey, you haven't paid, this invoice is now X days old,             |
| 29:44      | and attaches the invoice to that one,                              |
| 29:47      | and then saves it as a draft, as a draft email.                    |
| 29:51      | And then later on in the day, when I get the reminder saying,      |
| 29:54      | hey, you know, follow up on these,                                 |
| 29:57      | I open those up, maybe tweak the language a little bit,            |
| 30:00      | depending on how angry I am at the client,                         |
| 30:03      | versus paying up.                                                  |
| 30:04      | Sure, you've got the one that says,                                |
| 30:06      | hey, maybe this fell through the cracks,                           |
| 30:08      | and the other one says, pay me.                                    |
| 30:10      | Yeah, that's right.                                                |
| 30:11      | When can I expect payment on this?                                 |
| 30:15      | And then I send them out during the day.                           |
| 30:17      | So it's not fully automated,                                       |
| 30:20      | I do not want emails going to my clients                           |
| 30:23      | without me looking them over before they go out,                   |
| 30:26      | but it's, I think, automated now to a point                        |
| 30:30      | that makes sense.                                                  |
| 30:31      | And again, this has developed over                                 |
| 30:37      | years and years and years of me figuring out,                      |
| 30:40      | oh, I want to be able to do this,                                  |
| 30:42      | oh, my system only does this,                                      |
| 30:43      | I'd like to add a little bit more,                                 |
| 30:45      | I'd like to, things changed,                                       |
| 30:47      | going from paper to PDFs.                                          |
| 30:50      | So, and this last change was having it run automatically           |
| 30:58      | to create the emails and save them as [[Drafts]],                      |
| 31:00      | because I started realising I'm not always                         |
| 31:04      | in the office on Tuesday,                                          |
| 31:05      | and I still want to send the email off,                            |
| 31:08      | I want to be able to do it from my iPad,                           |
| 31:11      | or my phone, for that matter.                                      |
| 31:13      | And if there are [[Drafts]], they're already there.                    |
| 31:14      | No, I can do that because it's exactly,                            |
| 31:16      | they're already there.                                             |
| 31:18      | Have you considered adding a priority to the reminder?             |
| 31:21      | So if there's a priority set,                                      |
| 31:22      | then it needs to use the Angry Drang template,                     |
| 31:25      | otherwise it knows that it's using the normal template.            |
| 31:28      | You know, it's so hard to figure out                               |
| 31:30      | when I should be angry or not,                                     |
| 31:33      | and honestly, at some point, my default becomes anger.             |
| 31:36      | Ah, so it's better to start with the less angry template.          |
| 31:41      | Exactly, it's so much easier to send the one out                   |
| 31:44      | that is gentle.                                                    |
| 31:46      | That's the one I normally send out.                                |
| 31:49      | But everyone's, no, I start,                                       |
| 31:51      | is it worth me going in there                                      |
| 31:53      | and fiddling with the language on this one?                        |
| 31:54      | Oh, yeah, yes it is, this is egregious.                            |
| 31:59      | You know, especially when I look at,                               |
| 32:00      | and I see, oh, it's 180 days now that it's that old,               |
| 32:05      | and the language starts getting more strict.                       |
| 32:08      | Yeah, that's when I start putting the number of days in,           |
| 32:11      | is when you know I'm starting to get rid of you.                   |
| 32:16      | It has helped, actually.                                           |
| 32:18      | I find, since doing this,                                          |
| 32:21      | and having a system for following up in particular,                |
| 32:24      | I've always had a system for generating the original invoice,      |
| 32:28      | but my system for following up                                     |
| 32:30      | was a bit more haphazard in the past.                              |
| 32:32      | And over the last few years,                                       |
| 32:34      | when I have this sort of automatic reminder saying,                |
| 32:37      | you know, you need to follow up with these people,                 |
| 32:42      | I have been doing it more,                                         |
| 32:44      | and I have been getting paid more close to on time                 |
| 32:50      | than in the past.                                                  |
| 32:51      | By the way, those reminders all have what's it called,             |
| 32:55      | where it'll do it again in two weeks,                              |
| 33:01      | or every three, a repeat thing                                     |
| 33:03      | that does it every two or three weeks,                             |
| 33:06      | depending on what.                                                 |
| 33:08      | And that also is something, unfortunately,                         |
| 33:10      | that's something I cannot automate.                                |
| 33:11      | The addition of a repetitive feature to a reminder                 |
| 33:17      | is something that [[AppleScript]] does not allow you to do.            |
| 33:19      | So that has to be done by hand                                     |
| 33:21      | in the middle of creating the reminder.                            |
| 33:23      | So the automation kind of makes the reminder,                      |
| 33:27      | leaves reminders up on my screen                                   |
| 33:30      | to essentially prompt me to go ahead                               |
| 33:33      | and add that repeat feature to it.                                 |
| 33:37      | And you've been generous with this.                                |
| 33:39      | You've posted a blog post                                          |
| 33:41      | where you've listed all of these scripts,                          |
| 33:42      | and you're running it through a Python script,                     |
| 33:45      | but the AppleScript language is embedded in that script.           |
| 33:48      | So anybody that wants to just do this with AppleScript             |
| 33:51      | could do it.                                                       |
| 33:52      | You could.                                                         |
| 33:54      | I don't recommend it to doing things                               |
| 33:56      | because there's a certain amount of text processing,               |
| 34:01      | and there's a certain amount of calendar processing                |
| 34:06      | that I think Python is just flatly better at than AppleScript.     |
| 34:10      | But yes, I write AppleScript inside my Python,                     |
| 34:14      | and I have a self-made, very simple library                        |
| 34:24      | called, I think it's called AppleScript,                           |
| 34:26      | and it has only a couple of commands in it                         |
| 34:31      | that one of them I think is quote, and one of them is run.         |
| 34:34      | And so usually I just create a string                              |
| 34:36      | that would be my AppleScript.                                      |
| 34:38      | Within the Python program, I create a string                       |
| 34:40      | for the command that I would give in AppleScript,                  |
| 34:42      | and then there's, you know,                                        |
| 34:43      | AppleScript.run that string, and it does it.                       |
| 34:47      | But the point is you can actually take pieces of this out          |
| 34:49      | if you're listening and you think,                                 |
| 34:50      | well, yeah, I'd like to do that little piece that he's doing.      |
| 34:54      | A lot of this scripting in here,                                   |
| 34:56      | you could completely separate.                                     |
| 34:59      | I'd like to talk about one piece of it that you did                |
| 35:01      | that kind of made my eyebrows jump,                                |
| 35:04      | is when you're doing your reminders,                               |
| 35:06      | you said it's looking at presumably your database                  |
| 35:10      | and looking, it's doing a date check to figure out                 |
| 35:12      | the ones that are unpaid and seven weeks old.                      |
| 35:15      | How are you figuring that out automatically?                       |
| 35:19      | It is not so much doing it that way.                               |
| 35:22      | It's actually looking in reminders                                 |
| 35:25      | and looking at the due date in reminders.                          |
| 35:28      | So what my script does on Tuesday morning is say,                  |
| 35:32      | which reminders have come due today?                               |
| 35:34      | Okay.                                                              |
| 35:35      | And AppleScript allows you to do that.                             |
| 35:38      | The AppleScript library or dictionary for reminders                |
| 35:43      | has pieces like that, commands for doing that.                     |
| 35:46      | So what it does is it gives me a list then                         |
| 35:49      | of all of the invoices that are all of the reminders               |
| 35:55      | because it doesn't really know about invoices,                     |
| 35:57      | but it reads the text of all the reminders.                        |
| 35:59      | Then it parses and figures out which ones are due that day.        |
| 36:04      | Then it parses the reminder itself.                                |
| 36:06      | And the reminder says it's invoice number X                        |
| 36:10      | for Y amount of money and so on on project number Y.               |
| 36:16      | And then it looks in the database to figure out                    |
| 36:18      | who the client is for project number Y                             |
| 36:20      | and what his or her email address is.                              |
| 36:23      | And so that's how it helps make the reminder email.                |
| 36:28      | Well, I think it's brilliant.                                      |
| 36:30      | And I love that you shared this whole thing.                       |
| 36:32      | I mean, he explains it all in the blog post                        |
| 36:35      | and then you can download the entire Python script.                |
| 36:37      | You could run the system yourself if you want.                     |
| 36:40      | I love, this is something you do often, Dr. Drang,                 |
| 36:44      | where there'll be some problem                                     |
| 36:46      | and you have basically Homebrewed your own solution to it.         |
| 36:50      | And I think it's probably your hobby, right?                       |
| 36:53      | I mean, you do a lot of this stuff.                                |
| 36:55      | And, but it's just,                                                |
| 36:56      | it's fascinating to see how you do this stuff.                     |
| 36:59      | And so often the thing you've built is better                      |
| 37:02      | than anything out there that, you know,                            |
| 37:04      | it's more customised to what you need.                             |
| 37:06      | I remember years ago, I used to read the ongoing                   |
| 37:11      | problems you were having as you built your own custom              |
| 37:13      | basically weather app                                              |
| 37:14      | because you wanted the exact weather where you're located.         |
| 37:19      | Yeah, that was- You're still doing that?                           |
| 37:22      | Well, I was up until, I was still using that                       |
| 37:25      | up until recently it was working.                                  |
| 37:27      | But what, I don't remember, was it Yahoo?                          |
| 37:31      | No, I think it was whatever third party weather API                |
| 37:40      | I was logging into, oh, it was Weather Underground.                |
| 37:45      | It was Weather Underground.                                        |
| 37:46      | Yeah, Weather Underground.                                         |
| 37:47      | And, well, they shut themselves down.                              |
| 37:50      | And so I kept checking my weather apps                             |
| 37:54      | and they kept working for a month or two                           |
| 37:57      | after Weather Underground said they were shutting                  |
| 38:00      | down their API.                                                    |
| 38:01      | So they didn't really shut their web, but it's dead now.           |
| 38:04      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 38:06      | When I opened those pages now,                                     |
| 38:08      | because they were basically just web pages                         |
| 38:10      | that were sort of made on the fly                                  |
| 38:13      | through like JavaScript or whatever.                               |
| 38:15      | And now they're dead now.                                          |
| 38:17      | So I'm, so I have to use more standard weather apps.               |
| 38:22      | And I haven't gone back to find another API to do that.            |
| 38:28      | It's something that I, maybe when I retire,                        |
| 38:30      | I will go back to doing that.                                      |
| 38:32      | retired people are a lot more interested in the weather,           |
| 38:35      | I think.                                                           |
| 38:35      | I think it depends on where you live.                              |
| 38:36      | If you live in California like David,                              |
| 38:38      | then basically you just need to check whether or not               |
| 38:40      | it's the right season for rain, right?                             |
| 38:43      | Yeah, honestly, all I need to know is that going to rain.          |
| 38:46      | And almost always the answer is no.                                |
| 38:50      | So it's really not a problem.                                      |
| 38:53      | Things are more interesting here in the Midwest.                   |
| 38:56      | And so it's nice to know what's going on                           |
| 38:59      | and what's going on this afternoon,                                |
| 39:01      | even though things look nice now.                                  |
| 39:03      | So you also do some automation on the iOS side.                    |
| 39:06      | And I know that you're a big user of the [[Drafts]] app,               |
| 39:10      | which, by the way, just released the Mac version of [[Drafts]].        |
| 39:14      | Yeah, which is very nice.                                          |
| 39:17      | And it has been, I think, to all of us,                            |
| 39:20      | because I think we all use [[Drafts]],                                 |
| 39:22      | has been a big help because I do a lot of writing in [[Drafts]].       |
| 39:26      | And then getting it over to my Mac                                 |
| 39:29      | was not a horrible problem.                                        |
| 39:32      | But typically the way I would do it                                |
| 39:33      | is I would write it out to a Dropbox file                          |
| 39:37      | so that I could then pick it up on my Mac.                         |
| 39:39      | Well, now it's much easier.                                        |
| 39:40      | You just open [[Drafts]].                                              |
| 39:41      | And I typically don't do betas                                     |
| 39:45      | because I'm a terrible beta tester.                                |
| 39:46      | I'm not good at giving feedback                                    |
| 39:49      | because I just get lost in the work that pays me.                  |
| 39:52      | And I forget to follow up with people.                             |
| 39:55      | But I did do the beta on that because it was wonderful.            |
| 40:00      | And Greg Pierce did a really good job on this.                     |
| 40:04      | So now I just walk over to my Mac and there it is.                 |
| 40:07      | And I can do whatever I want with the text from within [[Drafts]].     |
| 40:13      | But yeah, I do a lot of, I do a surprising amount                  |
| 40:18      | of automation within [[Drafts]].                                       |
| 40:19      | Now, I use [[Drafts]].                                                 |
| 40:22      | I like to have one text editor per platform.                       |
| 40:28      | I don't like using lots of different ones just because,            |
| 40:32      | and especially on iOS because the standards for keyboard shortcuts |
| 40:38      | when you have a keyboard hooked up, things like that,              |
| 40:41      | aren't as well-established on iOS as they are on Mac.              |
| 40:44      | It definitely varies between apps on iOS.                          |
| 40:47      | Oh, yeah.                                                          |
| 40:47      | Yeah, so I try not to have to remember any of that stuff.          |
| 40:52      | And so now it's not to say that I don't change,                    |
| 40:55      | but I like to work primarily with one at a time.                   |
| 40:58      | And the one that I'm using now more than any other                 |
| 41:01      | is [[Drafts]].                                                         |
| 41:02      | I do use Textastic a bit because it's                              |
| 41:05      | got a broader range of syntax highlighting for me.                 |
| 41:12      | [[Drafts]] is pretty well-limited in its syntax highlighting           |
| 41:14      | to Markdown and JavaScript and then the very Taskpaper            |
| 41:20      | and the simple list thing.                                         |
| 41:21      | But I write in late tech and I program in Python.                  |
| 41:27      | And so I like having Textastic sometimes.                          |
| 41:31      | But mostly I do still write in [[Drafts]].                             |
| 41:35      | And so I have, jeez, a variety of things                           |
| 41:40      | that have sort of crept in through [[Drafts]],                         |
| 41:43      | a variety of automations.                                          |
| 41:45      | So one set of them is I have been                                  |
| 41:51      | blogging through [[Drafts]] pretty much exclusively                    |
| 41:55      | for a couple of years now.                                         |
| 41:58      | And I have, over the time, built up                                |
| 42:01      | a lot of little actions that help me out.                          |
| 42:04      | And like all automations, they're                                  |
| 42:07      | things that I did by hand and then decided                         |
| 42:09      | I'm tired of doing this by hand.                                   |
| 42:11      | It's taking too long.                                              |
| 42:12      | Or it's not so much that it takes so long.                         |
| 42:14      | It takes you out of the flow of what you're doing.                 |
| 42:18      | Yes.                                                               |
| 42:19      | If I want to add a link, I don't want                              |
| 42:22      | to have to think about going over here, grabbing the URL,          |
| 42:25      | coming back, putting the markdown text in,                         |
| 42:29      | and then going down because I put all my links at the bottom.      |
| 42:33      | I use the markdown reference link style instead of inline.         |
| 42:37      | And so doing all of that, by the time I'm done with it,            |
| 42:41      | I have forgotten what I was writing about because I'm old          |
| 42:44      | and I forget things.                                               |
| 42:45      | So that's really, and of course I make mistakes in doing that.     |
| 42:50      | You get the syntax wrong a little bit sometimes.                   |
| 42:53      | So automation fixes the fact that you get taken out                |
| 42:59      | of the flow of your work.                                          |
| 43:00      | And it fixes the fact that you might make mistakes                 |
| 43:02      | because if you get the automation right, which                     |
| 43:05      | sometimes takes a little while, but once you get the automation    |
| 43:08      | right, it's right all the time from that point on.                 |
| 43:12      | And actually, that particular piece of automation                  |
| 43:14      | is not one that I wrote.                                           |
| 43:16      | It's one that I stole.                                             |
| 43:19      | It's in the actions directory.                                     |
| 43:21      | And it was written by, it's called Markdown Reference Link.        |
| 43:25      | And it was written by P Davison-Reiber.                           |
| 43:30      | And it's excellent.                                                |
| 43:33      | And it mimics, well, mimics.                                       |
| 43:35      | I'm sure he did this on his own, or she                            |
| 43:37      | did this on his own on her own, but it matches so perfectly        |
| 43:42      | an AppleScript that I wrote many years ago                        |
| 43:45      | for doing this in [[BBEdit]].                                         |
| 43:47      | It does exactly what I used to do in [[BBEdit]],                      |
| 43:51      | except it does it in [[Drafts]].                                       |
| 43:53      | So I was thinking about writing my own.                            |
| 43:55      | I was thinking about taking that AppleScript                      |
| 43:57      | and converting it into JavaScript                                  |
| 43:59      | so that it would work in [[Drafts]] and realised, oh,                  |
| 44:02      | I don't have to.                                                   |
| 44:03      | This is already done for me.                                       |
| 44:05      | So there's that one.                                               |
| 44:06      | There are, when I need to add an image link, very simple to do.    |
| 44:15      | And so I have a [[Drafts]] action for doing that.                      |
| 44:18      | If I want to add a YouTube video link,                             |
| 44:20      | I have a [[Drafts]] action for that that just makes me,                |
| 44:22      | I only have to press one button.                                   |
| 44:26      | I have one for adding footnotes.                                   |
| 44:30      | Again, press a button.                                             |
| 44:31      | It looks like an asterisk is what the button looks like.           |
| 44:35      | And then finally, because a lot of my blog posts                   |
| 44:42      | have scripts in them, I like to line number the scripts.           |
| 44:48      | And so I have an action that will add line numbers                 |
| 44:53      | to a selected portion of a draft and format things the way         |
| 44:58      | I like to have things formatted for that.                          |
| 45:01      | And finally, and this was perhaps the most difficult thing,        |
| 45:06      | is the part that it publishes now.                                 |
| 45:09      | So it goes to my server.                                           |
| 45:12      | I have a button that I press that goes to the server               |
| 45:16      | and runs the code that converts the markdown into HTML,            |
| 45:23      | puts it, incorporates it into the directory structure              |
| 45:27      | of my blog, and therefore publishes it.                            |
| 45:32      | And then finally, there's a button                                 |
| 45:35      | for tweeting a link to it.                                         |
| 45:38      | And again, that doesn't do it directly on the iPad.                |
| 45:42      | It goes off, I believe, it goes off to the server, right?          |
| 45:45      | Yeah, I think it goes off to the server, not to one of my Macs,    |
| 45:48      | and runs a particular script that accesses the Twitter API         |
| 45:54      | to add a link to that Twitter tweet with a link to that post.      |
| 46:04      | Just like you don't want to automate sending an email              |
| 46:06      | to a client, I am terrified of automating pressing the post        |
| 46:09      | button.                                                            |
| 46:12      | See, I find it's much easier to edit a blog post                   |
| 46:14      | after I've published it versus calling back an email that I've     |
| 46:18      | already hit send on.                                               |
| 46:19      | Yeah, yes, there is that, yes.                                     |
| 46:25      | Because I can always hop into my,                                  |
| 46:28      | I've just switched back to WordPress,                              |
| 46:29      | so everything's confusing, but I can always hop into WordPress     |
| 46:31      | and change the status back to draft                                |
| 46:33      | and hope that nobody's seen it and that the automatic              |
| 46:36      | tweet hasn't gone out yet.                                         |
| 46:38      | And then mess around if I realise that I have a massive            |
| 46:40      | typo or accidentally forgot a code block,                          |
| 46:43      | which happens every once in a while.                               |
| 46:45      | Yeah, so typically, I will go ahead and publish it,                |
| 46:49      | and then it's out there for the world,                             |
| 46:50      | and then I go look at it in Safari, and I see,                     |
| 46:55      | oh, that's not good, and I go back and I tweak it,                 |
| 46:58      | and of course, I don't find everything,                            |
| 47:01      | but I tweak it to at least the mistakes that I find,               |
| 47:05      | and then republish it, because my published script                 |
| 47:07      | allows me to distinguish between things that are new               |
| 47:11      | and things that are reworked, edited,                              |
| 47:15      | and until, then after I've done that,                              |
| 47:20      | then I say, okay, fine, I'll tweet out the link,                   |
| 47:23      | because people, it's surprising to me,                             |
| 47:27      | because I really don't think Twitter is a great way                |
| 47:28      | of finding stuff.                                                  |
| 47:31      | I still prefer RSS, and I think I will always prefer RSS,          |
| 47:35      | but lots of people get their information through Twitter,          |
| 47:38      | and that's why I still tweet those out.                            |
| 47:41      | Yes, yeah, I have to say a lot of people do,                       |
| 47:45      | or they like to reply on Twitter,                                  |
| 47:47      | and so if you've already got the post out there,                   |
| 47:49      | then of course, it's an easy one spot                              |
| 47:51      | for everybody to talk back area.                                   |
| 47:53      | It is, and when I gave up comments,                                |
| 47:57      | when I stopped using comments on my site many years ago,           |
| 48:02      | I figured Twitter would take over,                                 |
| 48:03      | and it's worked out well.                                          |
| 48:06      | Yes.                                                               |
| 48:06      | Remember when that was a big deal                                  |
| 48:07      | about bloggers and comments?                                       |
| 48:09      | It just, I mean, there was so much ink spilled                     |
| 48:13      | on the internet over whether you put comments on your blog,        |
| 48:16      | and now just nobody does it.                                       |
| 48:18      | Well, there are certain blogs that are not                         |
| 48:22      | in our business, in our world,                                     |
| 48:25      | but political blogs live by comments                               |
| 48:29      | because they have a community and people argue                     |
| 48:30      | with one another and things like that,                             |
| 48:32      | and I think the blog comments are still just as bad                |
| 48:37      | as they are everywhere else, if not worse,                         |
| 48:39      | but that's how those kinds of bloggers build up a community        |
| 48:45      | is by letting their readers spew.                                  |
| 48:48      | Yeah, like I said, for most of us, though,                         |
| 48:52      | there's no more comments.                                          |
| 48:54      | I guess that's really the reason                                   |
| 48:55      | why these forums have come back as we wanted a place,              |
| 48:58      | but we didn't want to have to deal                                 |
| 49:00      | with all of the comment spamming                                   |
| 49:02      | we were getting on blogs a few years ago.                          |
| 49:04      | Which was terrible, yes,                                           |
| 49:07      | and was one of the reasons why I got rid of it.                    |
| 49:10      | I'm tired of policing the comments.                                |
| 49:15      | Going back into [[Drafts]], so you mentioned                           |
| 49:17      | that you tap on buttons.                                           |
| 49:18      | Do you use that with the keyboard row,                             |
| 49:20      | or do you use that with the action group popped out?               |
| 49:24      | It's the keyboard row, typically.                                  |
| 49:26      | So I have a blogging set                                           |
| 49:30      | that comes up, and so I choose that one,                           |
| 49:32      | so then across the keyboard row,                                   |
| 49:34      | and of course, I'm usually typing on a physical keyboard,          |
| 49:38      | so that keyboard row shows up all the way down at the bottom.      |
| 49:42      | It's still on the screen, but there it is.                         |
| 49:44      | And so, yeah, no, exactly.                                         |
| 49:46      | I popped that, and I'm usually working in split screen             |
| 49:50      | when I'm writing a blog post,                                      |
| 49:51      | because I have either transit open                                 |
| 49:56      | in the other half of split screen,                                 |
| 50:00      | where I'm going through the various images                         |
| 50:03      | that I'm gonna put in the post,                                    |
| 50:05      | or I have Safari open in the other one,                            |
| 50:07      | which is where the links are gonna be.                             |
| 50:10      | So you haven't yet really replaced transit?                        |
| 50:13      | I have been using File Explorer and File Browser,                  |
| 50:17      | and my script for adding image links                               |
| 50:24      | does allow me, it's tolerant                                       |
| 50:29      | of whether I'm getting that URL out of Transmit                    |
| 50:34      | or out of File Explorer,                                           |
| 50:36      | or maybe it's File Browser, actually, I think.                     |
| 50:40      | I am waiting.                                                      |
| 50:44      | Transmit is not gonna last forever,                                |
| 50:47      | but I'm happy that I have it, and I still use it.                  |
| 50:51      | I'm gonna use it until it stops working,                           |
| 50:54      | because I really like it, File Browser and File Explorer           |
| 51:00      | are both okay, they're both fine,                                  |
| 51:02      | but they just do not look like a panic app,                        |
| 51:05      | and they don't work like a panic app.                              |
| 51:08      | And honestly, the guys at Panic just understand                    |
| 51:15      | how I use an app.                                                  |
| 51:16      | I don't know whether they understand how other people do,          |
| 51:19      | but boy, Transmit just works so well for me.                       |
| 51:23      | And for those in the audience who aren't up on this,               |
| 51:25      | Panic is just an amazing development house out of Portland.        |
| 51:30      | They made this great app,                                          |
| 51:31      | this FTP app for iOS called Transmit,                              |
| 51:34      | they also make it for Mac,                                         |
| 51:36      | and they just stopped,                                             |
| 51:38      | they weren't making enough money on it,                            |
| 51:39      | and now all of us,                                                 |
| 51:41      | and there really isn't an equal replacement.                       |
| 51:44      | I wish kind of that they had just doubled the price                |
| 51:47      | just to see what would happen.                                     |
| 51:48      | Yeah, you know, but the,                                           |
| 51:52      | because I think that those of us that love it would have paid.     |
| 51:55      | Yeah, it's unfortunate.                                            |
| 51:57      | And you know, every time Panic tweets out something,               |
| 52:03      | oh, there's a new version of Transmit,                             |
| 52:04      | you know, my heart jumps,                                          |
| 52:06      | and okay, no, no, it's the one for the Mac,                        |
| 52:07      | which I love, I mean, I'm really happy.                            |
| 52:09      | I use Panic obviously on the Mac as well,                          |
| 52:11      | and it's a great program, and I love it.                           |
| 52:14      | But oh, I really wish they would go back to it.                    |
| 52:18      | I understand their reasons.                                        |
| 52:19      | Yeah, it's a shame though,                                         |
| 52:20      | because it had shortcuts integration,                              |
| 52:22      | which I used so much myself to get images uploaded,                |
| 52:26      | and I miss it.                                                     |
| 52:26      | It's, if they went with a subscription system,                     |
| 52:30      | and you know, obviously like many people,                          |
| 52:32      | I'm not thrilled with subscriptions,                               |
| 52:35      | but Transmit, I would subscribe to,                                |
| 52:37      | just as I have with [[Drafts]].                                        |
| 52:39      | Yeah, we all have our [[Drafts]].                                      |
| 52:41      | Yeah, exactly.                                                     |
| 52:43      | It's worth it.                                                     |
| 52:44      | And they kind of,                                                  |
| 52:46      | if I'm remembering right,                                          |
| 52:47      | I kind of decided to shut it down                                  |
| 52:50      | before subscriptions became a big thing,                           |
| 52:54      | which is too bad.                                                  |
| 52:56      | I would have liked them to try that,                               |
| 52:57      | you know, try one more thing                                       |
| 52:59      | before deciding to shut it down,                                   |
| 53:01      | but obviously they have a business to run.                         |
| 53:04      | Well, at least it's still running for you.                         |
| 53:06      | Which is an indication of how well it's written,                   |
| 53:08      | because Apple is changing things underneath,                       |
| 53:11      | but it's still running along because they didn't do,               |
| 53:14      | obviously they didn't do cheating things                           |
| 53:17      | in the development of that app.                                    |
| 53:19      | Or if they did, they were extremely clever about it.               |
| 53:21      | So I, you know, they were using,                                   |
| 53:23      | they apparently were using standard APIs                           |
| 53:25      | and those, you know, very solid parts                              |
| 53:30      | of the IO, the underlying iOS structure,                           |
| 53:33      | and that's why it's still working.                                 |
| 53:34      | Because gosh, how long has it been                                 |
| 53:35      | since they announced that they were done with it?                  |
| 53:38      | They stopped developing on it quite a while ago.                   |
| 53:40      | I just found the link to add it to the show notes,                 |
| 53:43      | and they announced that January 5th, 2018, so over a year ago.     |
| 53:47      | Oh, that's, gosh, it seems like it was longer ago than that.       |
| 53:50      | It does.                                                           |
| 53:51      | Maybe it's just because I've been,                                 |
| 53:52      | I've been feeling angst about it for such a long time.             |
| 53:56      | And dead man walking the software, yes.                            |
| 53:58      | Exactly.                                                           |
| 53:59      | But, you know, and then like,                                      |
| 54:00      | iOS 13's gonna come out                                            |
| 54:02      | and it's gonna have all these cool new features,                   |
| 54:03      | but it may have a cost for you, a dire cost.                       |
| 54:07      | It may be the end of it.                                           |
| 54:08      | It might.                                                          |
| 54:09      | Yes.                                                               |
| 54:10      | And I have substitutes ready to go.                                |
| 54:12      | I just, I just would rather not, if possible.                      |
| 54:16      | Well, if the good folks are panicking listening,                   |
| 54:18      | we will give you the money.                                        |
| 54:19      | Just give us transmit for iOS back.                                |
| 54:22      | Between the three of us, I'm sure we could,                        |
| 54:25      | we can convince them, right?                                       |
| 54:26      | Oh yeah, we're super wealthy.                                      |
| 54:28      | The three of us, we could fund it entirely, right?                 |
| 54:30      | Yeah, yeah.                                                        |
| 54:31      | And maybe Tim Cook can chip in for the rest.                       |
| 54:34      | That would be good.                                                |
| 54:35      | That would be good.                                                |
| 54:37      | Yeah, he should support iOS a little bit more.                     |
| 54:40      | Here's an idea, add like, in the about screen,                     |
| 54:46      | add some sort of Pong game,                                        |
| 54:48      | and then make it part of the new                                   |
| 54:51      | Apple Game Subscription service.                                   |
| 54:55      | Have Apple throw like millions of dollars at them                  |
| 54:57      | to get the app, you know, tuned up again.                          |
| 55:01      | And we'll all subscribe to the gaming service                      |
| 55:03      | and use transmit.                                                  |
| 55:04      | Well, it's just like.                                              |
| 55:05      | I think games certainly work for James.                            |
| 55:07      | Yes, I was just gonna say it's work for James Thompson.            |
| 55:09      | So yeah, yeah, exactly.                                            |
| 55:12      | All right, well, we have been broaching the subject                |
| 55:15      | of Siri shortcuts and some iOS stuff.                              |
| 55:17      | And I know you have feelings on that.                              |
| 55:19      | We're gonna talk about that right after this.                      |

| 56:10      | Today, I had one of those days,                                    |
| 56:12      | I couldn't type my own name.                                       |
| 56:15      | Every time I tried to send an email,                               |
| 56:16      | it would go out as some version of something                       |
| 56:18      | that wasn't quite my name.                                         |
| 56:20      | So I was called Rise, Rose Without the O,                          |
| 56:23      | Roz Without an E at the end, all sorts of things.                  |
| 56:27      | I realised, of course, what I need to do                           |
| 56:29      | is I need to change my email signature with TextExpander.        |
| 56:33      | So now whenever I type Lieberkurse                                 |
| 56:36      | or mit freundlichen Grüßen at the end of my messages,              |
| 56:39      | I start typing and TextExpander does the rest,                   |
| 56:42      | including my name.                                                 |
| 56:43      | No more oops, I spelt my own name wrong again.                     |

| 56:58      | Okay, before we started recording,                                 |
| 57:01      | you started talking about iOS and automation                       |
| 57:04      | and I could tell that you had a head of steam going,               |
| 57:07      | so I stopped you.                                                  |
| 57:08      | I wanted to get it on mic.                                         |
| 57:10      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 57:11      | Tell me about Siri shortcuts.                                      |
| 57:12      | What is the aggravation for you?                                   |
| 57:15      | Well, okay.                                                        |
| 57:16      | So first, it is a marvelous program.                               |
| 57:20      | There's no question about it,                                      |
| 57:24      | but my problems with it go all the way back.                       |
| 57:27      | And some of these problems are my problems.                        |
| 57:28      | They're not the problems with shortcuts itself,                    |
| 57:30      | but some of them really are shortcuts problems.                    |
| 57:33      | So when it started and it was workflow                             |
| 57:36      | and I was reading blog posts and listening to podcasts             |
| 57:39      | and everybody who was just in love with this program               |
| 57:42      | and I started using it and I hated it.                             |
| 57:45      | I thought that workflow was one                                    |
| 57:49      | of the worst development environments I had ever been in,          |
| 57:54      | worse even than Automator,                                         |
| 57:56      | which I'm not a big fan of either.                                 |
| 57:58      | And I just kind of brushed it off.                                 |
| 58:02      | Now, the reason for this was my fault.                             |
| 58:07      | Not my fault, but this was because of my situation.                |
| 58:12      | At that time, I did not have an iPad.                              |
| 58:16      | I was still using a MacBook Air and my iPhone.                     |
| 58:20      | And so obviously on workflow, all I had was my iPhone.             |
| 58:23      | And I maintained to this day, developing a shortcut                |
| 58:28      | or a workflow on an iPhone is horrible,                            |
| 58:34      | a horrible experience because your workflow,                       |
| 58:38      | because it's not split.                                            |
| 58:40      | You don't have the split between the list of actions               |
| 58:43      | that you can choose from over on the left                          |
| 58:45      | and then your workflow or shortcut nowadays on the right           |
| 58:50      | where you've got your list of steps.                               |
| 58:52      | So you have to essentially, in order to choose a new task          |
| 59:00      | or a new step to add into your workflow,                           |
| 59:03      | you have to abandon seeing what your workflow is.                  |
| 59:07      | And I just think that's horrible.                                  |
| 59:10      | I don't like working that way.                                     |
| 59:13      | I like seeing what I'm working on                                  |
| 59:19      | while I'm picking the next step.                                   |
| 59:21      | And it's true, I should know what the next step                    |
| 59:24      | is going to be before I leave and I do,                            |
| 59:27      | but it still bothers me that I don't see the workflow              |
| 59:31      | that the program that I am working on                              |
| 59:34      | while I am shifting around and trying to find the next step.       |
| 59:39      | If I already know that there's a shortcut step available           |
| 59:43      | and I know what its name is,                                       |
| 59:45      | I can type in the little search field down at the bottom           |
| 59:49      | and get right to it.                                               |
| 59:50      | And so that doesn't take me out of my programming flow much.       |
| 59:57      | But there are a lot of times where I'm at a step                   |
| 59:59      | and I, well, you know, this has to do with,                        |
| 01:00:02   | I don't know, an image.                                            |
| 01:00:04   | Let me go find what I can do with an image.                        |
| 01:00:07   | And there's a certain amount of exploratory work                   |
| 01:00:09   | that you do when you're making a shortcut.                         |
| 01:00:13   | And as is the case when you're programming in any language,        |
| 01:00:17   | when you're using a library,                                       |
| 01:00:19   | you like to see, well, what does this library give me?             |
| 01:00:22   | You know, I've got, I'm working with an image.                     |
| 01:00:25   | Well, what does Python have in the Python Imageing Library          |
| 01:00:28   | that I can use?                                                    |
| 01:00:30   | Well, similarly in workflow, there are different shortcuts.        |
| 01:00:34   | There are different steps that you can do things with              |
| 01:00:38   | with images and sometimes I just like to go and explore.           |
| 01:00:41   | Well, when I'm going and exploring,                                |
| 01:00:43   | I can't, on an iPhone, I can't see the program                     |
| 01:00:47   | that I'm looking at.                                               |
| 01:00:48   | So then I got an iPad a couple of years ago                        |
| 01:00:53   | and I decided to try workflow again.                               |
| 01:00:56   | It was still workflow at the time.                                 |
| 01:00:58   | And I said, oh, this is why people like this                       |
| 01:01:01   | because now I have the split screen                                |
| 01:01:04   | and I can still see, I can see what I'm working on                 |
| 01:01:06   | while I'm off doing the exploration.                               |
| 01:01:08   | And so that got much better.                                       |
| 01:01:10   | And I wrote several little workflows in that time                  |
| 01:01:15   | before it switched over to shortcuts.                              |
| 01:01:17   | And, you know, I have to say still,                                |
| 01:01:21   | this visual way of writing programs                                |
| 01:01:27   | is not entirely to my liking.                                      |
| 01:01:29   | I'd still rather just type it out.                                 |
| 01:01:32   | I understand that other people and especially people               |
| 01:01:35   | who don't have 35 years of programming behind them                 |
| 01:01:40   | like to do it this other way.                                      |
| 01:01:42   | And it's a good introduction.                                      |
| 01:01:43   | I understand all that, but I can't help.                           |
| 01:01:45   | I am who I am.                                                     |
| 01:01:46   | And I really do prefer to just type these things out.              |
| 01:01:50   | You know, possibly with documentation on the screen                |
| 01:01:54   | next to it as I'm writing it out.                                  |
| 01:01:57   | Part of it is because I think I'm getting to sound                 |
| 01:02:01   | like John Siracusa on here,                                        |
| 01:02:02   | but part of it is these blocks of steps                            |
| 01:02:08   | take up a lot of space.                                            |
| 01:02:10   | And as you are making more and more complicated programs,          |
| 01:02:15   | you need to be able to see more to get a better sense              |
| 01:02:18   | of what's going on in your program or your script.                 |
| 01:02:23   | And workflow, like all of these visual type tools,                 |
| 01:02:28   | automator as well, cuts down on how much you can see at once       |
| 01:02:33   | because the blocks are so big.                                     |
| 01:02:36   | Still, it's nice.                                                  |
| 01:02:39   | My most recent problem though with shortcuts                       |
| 01:02:42   | is how they broke it with the two,                                 |
| 01:02:47   | and I don't know whether it broke with the 2.1                     |
| 01:02:50   | or the 2.1.1 or the 2.1.2.                                         |
| 01:02:54   | I can't, I don't remember exactly when it broke,                   |
| 01:02:59   | but they didn't fix it until 2.2.                                  |
| 01:03:00   | And I'm delighted that they did finally fix it.                    |
| 01:03:04   | And what they broke was everything having to do                    |
| 01:03:09   | with images, if you have a shortcut                                |
| 01:03:12   | that you would put in a sharing sheet                              |
| 01:03:14   | that takes as its input an image,                                  |
| 01:03:18   | it will not work or it would not work for a few months.            |
| 01:03:25   | I was kind of, and I use that actually a lot                       |
| 01:03:31   | while blogging because I will have an image                        |
| 01:03:33   | that's either a screenshot or a photo that I've taken              |
| 01:03:36   | and I wanna upload it to my server for the blog.                   |
| 01:03:41   | And I like to do that in a particular way                          |
| 01:03:44   | with a particular file name format.                                |
| 01:03:49   | And I had a shortcut that did that.                                |
| 01:03:52   | I had several shortcuts that did things with images.               |
| 01:03:55   | I kind of, for a while there, I went all in                        |
| 01:03:58   | on doing things with images in shortcuts.                          |
| 01:04:03   | In fact, probably the bulk of my shortcuts                         |
| 01:04:06   | for a while there were all image-based shortcuts.                  |
| 01:04:10   | And some of this was inspired by what [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] was doing           |
| 01:04:12   | with putting the frame around the iPhone type                      |
| 01:04:17   | or iPad looking frame around screenshots.                          |
| 01:04:21   | And so I had this tremendous investment                            |
| 01:04:27   | in shortcuts that dealt with images and they all broke.            |
| 01:04:32   | And so I had to go back to uploading                               |
| 01:04:35   | and renaming images by hand,                                       |
| 01:04:38   | which is just horrible.                                            |
| 01:04:40   | It's the worst thing in the world.                                 |
| 01:04:41   | It's like using punch cards again.                                 |
| 01:04:47   | But I got used to doing it with a tap here and there               |
| 01:04:52   | and a little bit and a small amount of typing.                     |
| 01:04:56   | My shortcut put in, there's the file format,                       |
| 01:04:59   | the file naming format that I use for images on my blog            |
| 01:05:03   | is the date, year, year, four digits a year,                       |
| 01:05:09   | two digits a month, two digits a day dash,                         |
| 01:05:12   | and then a description of the image                                |
| 01:05:13   | and then.jpeg or.png, whatever it happens to be.                   |
| 01:05:19   | And a lot of my blogging scripts                                   |
| 01:05:23   | that get links to those images assume that that is the case.       |
| 01:05:28   | And so they use the part after the dash to fill in the title       |
| 01:05:33   | and the alt fields of an image tag.                                |
| 01:05:37   | So anyway, a lot of this was automated for me                      |
| 01:05:40   | through my shortcuts and they all broke                            |
| 01:05:43   | and they kept breaking and then Automator did an update,           |
| 01:05:46   | the 2.1.3 and it didn't fix it.                                    |
| 01:05:48   | And I was just, I was so angry at the Automator team               |
| 01:05:54   | during this period because this was my main use of Automator,      |
| 01:05:58   | really was this stuff.                                             |
| 01:06:01   | And it was great until it stopped working                          |
| 01:06:04   | and then it was horrible.                                          |
| 01:06:05   | I was quite fortunate because one of the things                    |
| 01:06:08   | that I realised very early on is I don't always remember           |
| 01:06:11   | if I've written a shortcut to accept input                         |
| 01:06:13   | or for me to run it first.                                         |
| 01:06:15   | So what pretty much all of my shortcuts                            |
| 01:06:17   | that handle something like a share sheet do                        |
| 01:06:19   | is they check, they count whether or not there's input             |
| 01:06:22   | and if there's no input then they ask me                           |
| 01:06:23   | for the right kind of input.                                       |
| 01:06:25   | But I've built my shortcuts from the go with that in mind.         |
| 01:06:29   | And I know some people were using a workaround                     |
| 01:06:32   | where they had a run image shortcut shortcut                       |
| 01:06:35   | where they would run it and then it would get                      |
| 01:06:39   | whatever images they needed or something                           |
| 01:06:42   | and then it would pass them to the right shortcuts                 |
| 01:06:45   | just so they didn't have to rewrite everything.                    |
| 01:06:48   | But it's still very frustrating, unfortunately.                    |
| 01:06:51   | Yeah, and I had too many shortcuts that were built,                |
| 01:06:55   | the way I wanted them to be built                                  |
| 01:06:57   | because I really don't like the image picker                       |
| 01:07:00   | within shortcuts.                                                  |
| 01:07:01   | I really prefer, and I had done some shortcuts that way            |
| 01:07:05   | using the image picker and this is not for me.                     |
| 01:07:08   | I really like the way photos presents my images                    |
| 01:07:13   | and that's how I worked.                                           |
| 01:07:15   | And it was just, I looked at it and said,                          |
| 01:07:19   | well, surely the shortcuts team knows                              |
| 01:07:22   | that this is a problem.                                            |
| 01:07:24   | Exactly how this bug came through I don't understand               |
| 01:07:27   | because it seems like the regression tests                         |
| 01:07:30   | would have caught it before it got released.                       |
| 01:07:33   | And I also don't understand,                                       |
| 01:07:34   | this is very easy for me to say                                    |
| 01:07:36   | because I'm not the one who's doing the programming,               |
| 01:07:37   | but I'm angry.                                                     |
| 01:07:40   | So I'm gonna complain.                                             |
| 01:07:42   | I also don't understand why they didn't get this fixed out         |
| 01:07:45   | faster because it was months that this problem was there           |
| 01:07:50   | and it was, it soured me on the program                            |
| 01:07:55   | because one of the reasons for shortcuts                           |
| 01:08:00   | not being part of system software                                  |
| 01:08:03   | is that you can address things                                     |
| 01:08:05   | and you can add new features early on                              |
| 01:08:08   | and you can fix things that you've broken early,                   |
| 01:08:11   | not waiting another six months or a year                           |
| 01:08:14   | to get something done.                                             |
| 01:08:16   | And that's all true,                                               |
| 01:08:19   | but it seemed to happen too late for me,                           |
| 01:08:21   | too slowly for my taste.                                           |
| 01:08:24   | Surely the shortcuts people knew that this was a problem.          |
| 01:08:27   | Yeah, I'm sure they were very upset                                |
| 01:08:29   | about it being out there.                                          |
| 01:08:31   | It was rough for me                                                |
| 01:08:32   | because people had paid for a Siri shortcuts field guide           |
| 01:08:35   | and some of the scripts I gave them didn't work anymore.           |
| 01:08:38   | We're breaking, yes.                                               |
| 01:08:40   | So I had to build automation                                       |
| 01:08:41   | to explain what the problem was.                                   |
| 01:08:43   | Oh God.                                                            |
| 01:08:45   | Yeah.                                                              |
| 01:08:46   | So, but I do think and that happens                                |
| 01:08:49   | and the thing I wanna emphasise about this is                      |
| 01:08:53   | Apple is updating a product more than once a year.                 |
| 01:08:56   | So it's like, that's good.                                         |
| 01:08:58   | You know, I mean, I know that there was a problem with this        |
| 01:09:01   | but the fact that they continue to push                            |
| 01:09:03   | they've had two significant updates.                               |
| 01:09:05   | To me is a good sign.                                              |
| 01:09:06   | I'm crossing my fingers that in June                               |
| 01:09:08   | we're gonna get a lot of these things fixed.                       |
| 01:09:10   | The other complaint you have,                                      |
| 01:09:12   | which I think is entirely legitimate                               |
| 01:09:14   | is just the general programming environment                        |
| 01:09:19   | can be difficult if you wanna use it                               |
| 01:09:22   | beyond the most simple function.                                   |
| 01:09:24   | And, you know, we've talked on this show in the past               |
| 01:09:26   | about how small the text field is                                  |
| 01:09:28   | when you're working in text.                                       |
| 01:09:29   | And I can only imagine,                                            |
| 01:09:31   | I have never done it on the phone                                  |
| 01:09:32   | because I can't imagine doing it on the phone.                     |
| 01:09:34   | But even on the iPad,                                              |
| 01:09:38   | like working with text in a script is quite difficult.             |
| 01:09:41   | And like even just like,                                           |
| 01:09:43   | okay, you've created a block of actions here.                      |
| 01:09:46   | So often, especially with a simplified programming environment     |
| 01:09:50   | which Siri Shortcuts is,                                           |
| 01:09:52   | you wanna be able to just paste them                               |
| 01:09:54   | like in Keyboard Master all the time.                              |
| 01:09:56   | You get something figured out, Command C, Command V                |
| 01:09:59   | and then suddenly you've duplicated at 17 times                    |
| 01:10:02   | and it's great.                                                    |
| 01:10:03   | It's a little hacky                                                |
| 01:10:04   | that you had to do it that many times                              |
| 01:10:06   | but at least you didn't have to create it                          |
| 01:10:08   | from scratch 17 times.                                             |
| 01:10:10   | And-                                                               |
| 01:10:10   | You're absolutely right.                                           |
| 01:10:11   | And although, you know, yes,                                       |
| 01:10:14   | you can sort of make subroutines.                                  |
| 01:10:17   | You can make shortcuts                                             |
| 01:10:19   | because shortcuts can call other shortcuts.                        |
| 01:10:22   | You can make essentially subroutines that do something             |
| 01:10:25   | and then kind of, you know, you take some input,                   |
| 01:10:28   | you get some output.                                               |
| 01:10:28   | Okay, fine.                                                        |
| 01:10:32   | But yeah, being able to cop,                                       |
| 01:10:33   | sometimes that's just overkill                                     |
| 01:10:35   | and you don't wanna have this                                      |
| 01:10:37   | because you're not gonna be doing this a bunch of times.           |
| 01:10:40   | And yeah, being able to copy and paste steps,                      |
| 01:10:45   | not the whole shortcut,                                            |
| 01:10:46   | but just some steps to be able to use                              |
| 01:10:49   | either in two or three steps only                                  |
| 01:10:51   | to be able to use in another shortcut                              |
| 01:10:54   | or to be able to use later on in a shortcut                        |
| 01:10:57   | that you're writing right now and you can't do it.                 |
| 01:11:00   | And that's, text solves all those problems.                        |
| 01:11:05   | That being said, you know,                                         |
| 01:11:06   | the question that I think people have to ask themselves            |
| 01:11:08   | about Siri Shortcuts is,                                           |
| 01:11:10   | is this just a glass of water to a man in the desert?              |
| 01:11:13   | You know, which, you know, like we love it                         |
| 01:11:15   | just because it's any kind of automation on iOS                    |
| 01:11:19   | or is it an automation system that has merit on its own?           |
| 01:11:23   | And, you know, I would tend to look at the later of those two.     |
| 01:11:27   | I think that as a automation system                                |
| 01:11:31   | for people who are not gonna learn Python                          |
| 01:11:33   | and who turn me out,                                               |
| 01:11:35   | maybe they don't have even listening to this show anymore          |
| 01:11:36   | because we talked about regular expressions                        |
| 01:11:38   | at the beginning.                                                  |
| 01:11:40   | For people who don't wanna bother with that stuff,                 |
| 01:11:43   | but do want to make their devices work a little smarter            |
| 01:11:46   | for them and give them a little bit more automation,               |
| 01:11:48   | I think they've done a pretty good job                             |
| 01:11:50   | and like the integration with so many different applications       |
| 01:11:54   | and, you know, all the stuff they're doing                         |
| 01:11:56   | while some of it has some rough patches,                           |
| 01:11:59   | I feel like they're pointing it in the right direction.            |
| 01:12:01   | And I'm a fan, you know, at the end of the day.                    |
| 01:12:04   | I don't disagree with you.                                         |
| 01:12:06   | I just, you know, obviously there are things about it              |
| 01:12:10   | I don't like, but I still use it.                                  |
| 01:12:12   | And, you know, every programming language                          |
| 01:12:16   | and every programming environment                                  |
| 01:12:18   | has things that I don't like about it.                             |
| 01:12:20   | Nothing is a panacea.                                              |
| 01:12:23   | You're exactly right.                                              |
| 01:12:25   | Its integration is excellent.                                      |
| 01:12:27   | And I think the, perhaps in the future,                            |
| 01:12:32   | what we will find to be best about shortcuts                       |
| 01:12:36   | and Siri shortcuts in particular                                   |
| 01:12:40   | is that it allows Siri to work better                              |
| 01:12:45   | than it did on its own                                             |
| 01:12:47   | because when you make a shortcut                                   |
| 01:12:49   | that you intend to run by voice,                                   |
| 01:12:52   | you say, this is the name of my shortcut.                          |
| 01:12:55   | I want you to run this shortcut when I say this                    |
| 01:12:59   | and it records your voice and it knows what you said.              |
| 01:13:01   | And it's not trying to interpret what you said very much.          |
| 01:13:06   | And that, I think, gets around a lot of the problems               |
| 01:13:11   | of Siri's inability to understand what we're saying.               |
| 01:13:16   | You know, messing up what we're saying.                            |
| 01:13:19   | And I think that idea which didn't come                            |
| 01:13:23   | until we actually got Siri shortcuts itself                        |
| 01:13:26   | back last September, it wasn't part of workflow.                   |
| 01:13:30   | And it was in particular,                                          |
| 01:13:32   | it was something that could not have been done                     |
| 01:13:35   | if the workflow people had not been bought up by Apple.            |
| 01:13:39   | I think that is one of the best things                             |
| 01:13:42   | about shortcuts as opposed to workflow.                            |
| 01:13:46   | And, you know, apart from all the things about, you know,          |
| 01:13:49   | it's got the full force of Apple behind it.                        |
| 01:13:51   | Apple does seem to be behind it.                                   |
| 01:13:52   | Apple spent a lot of time talking about this feature               |
| 01:13:57   | back there in September.                                           |
| 01:13:59   | And, or was it, were they doing it in June at WWDC?                |
| 01:14:04   | Whatever it was, whenever, when they introduced it,                |
| 01:14:07   | they talked a lot about it                                         |
| 01:14:08   | and they talked a lot about it                                     |
| 01:14:11   | in a way that I think made sense                                   |
| 01:14:14   | and indicated that they were interested in promoting this.         |
| 01:14:21   | And I think it's a way of getting around, as I said,               |
| 01:14:23   | some of Siri's shortcomings about interpretation                   |
| 01:14:27   | and not understanding context.                                     |
| 01:14:29   | Now you can tell something to Siri                                 |
| 01:14:32   | and as long as Siri can actually hear you,                         |
| 01:14:34   | that there isn't enough,                                           |
| 01:14:35   | there isn't so much background noise that it can't hear you.       |
| 01:14:38   | As long as it can hear you,                                        |
| 01:14:40   | it knows exactly what you want to do.                              |
| 01:14:42   | It doesn't do its own weird, sometimes weird interpretation.       |
| 01:14:47   | Yes, and just the ability to chain                                 |
| 01:14:49   | a bunch of things together.                                        |
| 01:14:50   | So for example, when I tell my HomePod, good night,               |
| 01:14:53   | it doesn't just run my good night scene in home kit.               |
| 01:14:56   | It does six or seven things, including checking, you know,         |
| 01:15:00   | if I've gotten early work appointment for the next morning         |
| 01:15:03   | and reminds me to set my alarm if that's the case.                 |
| 01:15:06   | You know, being able to do that,                                   |
| 01:15:08   | leapfrogs over a lot of the problems                               |
| 01:15:10   | that people have with automation,                                  |
| 01:15:12   | where they want to be able to tell their machine                   |
| 01:15:15   | what it should do when they ask it for certain things.             |
| 01:15:18   | And some devices are just not capable of that                      |
| 01:15:21   | and Siri certainly wasn't before,                                  |
| 01:15:22   | but it's definitely getting there now, which is great.             |
| 01:15:26   | Absolutely, absolutely.                                            |
| 01:15:27   | And that is one of the great things about this,                    |
| 01:15:31   | you know, Siri shortcuts as opposed to just workflow.              |
| 01:15:36   | And honestly, though, your complaints                              |
| 01:15:39   | are completely legitimate,                                         |
| 01:15:40   | especially just the lack of power                                  |
| 01:15:43   | for a programming environment as someone who, you know,            |
| 01:15:48   | spends his time writing in Python and even AppleScript.           |
| 01:15:51   | I mean, AppleScript, everybody makes fun of it,                   |
| 01:15:53   | but it's a powerful scripting language                             |
| 01:15:56   | combined with Apple events.                                        |
| 01:15:58   | You can do almost anything on a Mac with it.                       |
| 01:16:00   | And you don't quite have that with Siri shortcuts.                 |
| 01:16:04   | And I think what you see as someone                                |
| 01:16:07   | who's an experienced automator                                     |
| 01:16:09   | is you immediately see the ceiling of the current iteration.       |
| 01:16:13   | And that I think is of concern,                                    |
| 01:16:15   | but I feel like it's going to,                                     |
| 01:16:19   | the ceiling is going to get higher.                                |
| 01:16:20   | I don't know if it's ever gonna give you                           |
| 01:16:22   | the unlimited power or automation you want,                        |
| 01:16:26   | but it's definitely going to get higher.                           |
| 01:16:29   | Yeah, well, I don't think it can                                   |
| 01:16:32   | because Apple wants iOS to be a more locked down system               |
| 01:16:38   | than the Mac.                                                      |
| 01:16:38   | In fact, it's making Mac more locked down                             |
| 01:16:42   | than it ever has been before.                                      |
| 01:16:43   | And there are legitimate reasons for that.                         |
| 01:16:45   | We live in a different world                                       |
| 01:16:47   | where security is far more important to all of us.                 |
| 01:16:51   | And so it's legitimate                                             |
| 01:16:53   | that Apple has locked things down more.                            |
| 01:16:56   | But yeah, it is.                                                   |
| 01:16:58   | So when we were talking about regular expressions,                 |
| 01:17:01   | we talked about, I'm sorry,                                        |
| 01:17:03   | I'm cutting your audience away again,                              |
| 01:17:05   | but you start with the simple stuff                                |
| 01:17:09   | and then you move on                                               |
| 01:17:10   | and you can work up to very complicated things                     |
| 01:17:15   | the more you learn about regular expressions.                      |
| 01:17:19   | And you can do that with almost any other language.                |
| 01:17:23   | You can do that with Perl,                                         |
| 01:17:24   | you can do that with Python.                                       |
| 01:17:26   | You can start off writing sort of baby type languages              |
| 01:17:29   | as you learn more about the language and its capabilities          |
| 01:17:34   | and also just about programming in general.                        |
| 01:17:37   | You can do the same thing in shortcuts, but,                       |
| 01:17:41   | and I've done it in shortcuts                                      |
| 01:17:43   | because when I started doing things in shortcuts,                  |
| 01:17:45   | man, my shortcuts were stupid.                                     |
| 01:17:47   | They, I didn't understand how magic variables worked               |
| 01:17:51   | and how you can extract things out of magic variables.             |
| 01:17:53   | It's just, and there's a thing that is not,                        |
| 01:17:57   | that is unlike almost every other programming,                     |
| 01:18:01   | maybe every other programming language that I have used.           |
| 01:18:04   | And it's an extremely powerful thing                               |
| 01:18:05   | and I didn't understand it at all.                                 |
| 01:18:06   | And so people like [[Matthew Cassinelli\|Matt Cassinelli]] were sort of                    |
| 01:18:11   | gently telling me, hey, look idiot,                                |
| 01:18:13   | you need to use magic variables here                               |
| 01:18:15   | and things will be much better.                                    |
| 01:18:19   | So there is a learning curve with shortcuts                        |
| 01:18:24   | and you can get better                                             |
| 01:18:27   | and you can work start off like I started off                      |
| 01:18:30   | and eventually you can get to where [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] is.                   |
| 01:18:35   | [[Federico Viticci]], everybody knows who [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] is.                  |
| 01:18:37   | So, but yeah, I am sealing the ceiling.                            |
| 01:18:44   | It's inevitable, I think that there's gonna be a ceiling.          |
| 01:18:47   | The ceiling comes from the fact                                    |
| 01:18:49   | that the individual apps on your phone                             |
| 01:18:54   | are only gonna let you do certain things.                          |
| 01:18:59   | And, you know, there's just no way around that.                    |
| 01:19:06   | Well, it's gonna be interesting to see how it plays out.           |
| 01:19:09   | I am encouraged by the fact                                        |
| 01:19:11   | that there have been two significant updates                       |
| 01:19:13   | in between iOS updates.                                            |
| 01:19:18   | That's encouraging to me.                                          |
| 01:19:19   | I do think that Apple, at least for the immediate future,          |
| 01:19:23   | is invested in Siri shortcuts.                                     |
| 01:19:26   | So I'm hoping that in June,                                        |
| 01:19:28   | we get a whole bunch of new toys                                   |
| 01:19:29   | and Rose and I have stuff to geek out over                         |
| 01:19:31   | for another year.                                                  |
| 01:19:33   | And, you know, but I guess we're just gonna have to wait           |
| 01:19:34   | and see, I mean, the other fear in the back of my mind             |
| 01:19:37   | is what if Apple loses interest in this, you know?                 |
| 01:19:40   | Cause like I feel like Automator started                           |
| 01:19:42   | with the best of intentions,                                       |
| 01:19:43   | but at some point, you know,                                       |
| 01:19:45   | they just didn't give Sal enough to work with over there           |
| 01:19:48   | to build it into what it could have been.                          |
| 01:19:51   | Yeah, Automator always, I think, yeah, Automator                   |
| 01:19:54   | always suffered when I was trying to use Automator,                |
| 01:19:57   | I'd always get to a step and then say,                             |
| 01:20:00   | crap, there's no step,                                             |
| 01:20:01   | there's no piece that I can stick in here in Automator.            |
| 01:20:06   | And then I would end up going back                                 |
| 01:20:08   | and doing it in AppleScript.                                      |
| 01:20:09   | Yeah, or writing a script to drop into the Automator.              |
| 01:20:12   | What are they like?                                                |
| 01:20:13   | Yeah, something like that.                                         |
| 01:20:15   | And it was, well, the thing was,                                   |
| 01:20:17   | if I had to write a script to drop into Automator,                 |
| 01:20:20   | why don't I just write the damn script entirely?                   |
| 01:20:23   | Write it entirely as a script, which often I did.                  |
| 01:20:26   | Sometimes, you know, you could combine the two.                    |
| 01:20:29   | And I do have Automator actions                                    |
| 01:20:32   | that basically run a script.                                       |
| 01:20:35   | They do a couple of little things                                  |
| 01:20:36   | and then they run a script and they work out fine.                 |
| 01:20:40   | But yeah, it's suffered from the fact                              |
| 01:20:43   | that it's library of available actions                             |
| 01:20:47   | or steps or whatever the hell they're called in Automator          |
| 01:20:52   | was limited and didn't seem                                        |
| 01:20:55   | to get significantly increased over time.                          |
| 01:20:59   | I mean, that's something that we're definitely seeing now          |
| 01:21:01   | because, I mean, Microsoft wrote action blocks for Automator       |
| 01:21:04   | and they were included in previous versions of Office.             |
| 01:21:06   | But last, I think two versions of Office,                          |
| 01:21:08   | two significant releases, 2016, 2019,                              |
| 01:21:12   | they removed them, they're gone.                                   |
| 01:21:15   | Whereas Shortcuts released last summer                             |
| 01:21:17   | and they've added and so many people have added actions.           |
| 01:21:20   | It is amazing.                                                     |
| 01:21:22   | Well, I mean, you know,                                            |
| 01:21:23   | Ben Walde is the guy who wrote those for Microsoft                 |
| 01:21:26   | and now he works for Apple.                                        |
| 01:21:27   | So I suspect there's nobody at Microsoft                           |
| 01:21:30   | that knows how to write the Automator action.                      |
| 01:21:34   | That would explain a lot.                                          |
| 01:21:37   | Yeah, it is unfortunate when things seem to get,                   |
| 01:21:40   | especially of course, when it's something that you rely on,        |
| 01:21:43   | seems to get abandoned.                                            |
| 01:21:44   | And it's just, you know,                                           |
| 01:21:48   | AppleScript has gone through this in the past,                     |
| 01:21:51   | not just Automator, but AppleScript itself, you know.              |
| 01:21:53   | Is AppleScript dead?                                               |
| 01:21:55   | Is Apple, it's not.                                                |
| 01:21:57   | You know, a few years ago, they actually came,                     |
| 01:21:59   | amazingly, they decided to come out                                |
| 01:22:01   | with an entirely new language that looks at Apple events,          |
| 01:22:06   | you know, JavaScript for applications.                             |
| 01:22:09   | And I don't like it because I'm not a big fan of JavaScript.       |
| 01:22:15   | And also because I find it,                                        |
| 01:22:18   | you know, how you write an AppleScript,                            |
| 01:22:21   | which is you start writing and then you realise,                   |
| 01:22:23   | I don't know exactly how the dictionary                            |
| 01:22:26   | for this particular app that I want to automate works.             |
| 01:22:29   | And you look at the dictionary                                     |
| 01:22:30   | and you don't really understand,                                   |
| 01:22:32   | can I just, does it have the word selection available to it?       |
| 01:22:37   | Does it have this, does it have that?                              |
| 01:22:39   | And then you just start typing into Google your problem.           |
| 01:22:43   | The solution is almost,                                            |
| 01:22:45   | there are lots of solutions for AppleScript problems               |
| 01:22:48   | because AppleScript has been around for such a long time.          |
| 01:22:51   | It's very hard to find JXA solutions,                              |
| 01:22:55   | or is it JXA or JESA, whatever it is,                              |
| 01:22:57   | in JavaScript solutions for these problems,                        |
| 01:23:01   | because it just hasn't been around for very long.                  |
| 01:23:03   | So I end up still writing mostly in AppleScript,                   |
| 01:23:07   | even though it's not a language that I particularly like.          |
| 01:23:11   | It's the only one where I can get things done,                     |
| 01:23:15   | certain things done.                                               |
| 01:23:16   | Well, we sure like all the automation you've been doing            |
| 01:23:19   | and I especially like the fact that you share                      |
| 01:23:22   | so much of it so freely over at leancrew.com                       |
| 01:23:25   | or whether that we call it the blog title                          |
| 01:23:28   | or the snowman page, you know, whatever we're gonna call it.       |
| 01:23:32   | We're gonna have links for all this in the show notes              |
| 01:23:35   | so you can go check it out.                                        |
| 01:23:36   | And I strongly recommend anyone listening                          |
| 01:23:39   | to follow Dr. Drang over at leancrew.com,                          |
| 01:23:42   | sign up for the RSS.                                               |
| 01:23:45   | I love your blog because it's high signal to noise.                |
| 01:23:48   | You don't put a post up every day,                                 |
| 01:23:49   | but when you do put a post up,                                     |
| 01:23:51   | it's always something that I wanna read                            |
| 01:23:52   | and we all really appreciate that.                                 |
| 01:23:55   | Well, thank you very much.                                         |
| 01:23:57   | And thanks for coming on the show.                                 |
| 01:23:59   | Are there any other places people should look for you              |
| 01:24:01   | on the internet?                                                   |
| 01:24:02   | Well, I'm Dr. Drang on Twitter and I don't tweet,                  |
| 01:24:05   | I don't blog as much as I used to                                  |
| 01:24:07   | and I don't tweet as much as I used to.                            |
| 01:24:08   | I happen to be going through a very busy time at work,             |
| 01:24:12   | but I hope to do more, especially with the blogging,               |
| 01:24:16   | maybe not so much more of the tweeting,                            |
| 01:24:17   | but if you follow me on Twitter,                                   |
| 01:24:19   | at least you'll know when the new posts come out.                  |
| 01:24:22   | We're gonna have a ton of links in this show,                      |
| 01:24:24   | including links to the specific [[Drafts]] automations                 |
| 01:24:29   | and that invoicing system that Dr. Drang was talking about.        |
| 01:24:32   | Yes.                                                               |
| 01:24:33   | Also, we didn't talk about it at the top of the show,              |
| 01:24:35   | but there's still space in the meetups in Orange County            |
| 01:24:38   | and San Jose that we've got planned for June.                      |
| 01:24:41   | They are filling up though.                                        |
| 01:24:42   | So if you're interested in doing that, let us know                 |
| 01:24:45   | because we're gonna have to make some decisions                    |
| 01:24:46   | about locations here real quick.                                   |
| 01:24:48   | And thanks a lot for listening.                                    |
| 01:24:51   | We are The Automators.                                             |
| 01:24:52   | You can find us over at relay.fm/automators.                 |
| 01:24:55   | Rose, anything exciting going on over at rosewater.com lately?     |
| 01:24:58   | Well, I've recently switched my blogging software,                 |
| 01:25:02   | so I'm automating more things                                      |
| 01:25:03   | and hopefully posting rather more                                  |
| 01:25:05   | because it's going to be a lot easier now                          |
| 01:25:06   | because I'm on WordPress.                                          |
| 01:25:08   | So yes, keep an eye out there and don't forget,                    |
| 01:25:10   | you can follow Automators at Automators FM on Twitter.             |
| 01:25:14   | And there's also the discourse group                               |
| 01:25:18   | over at talk.automators.fm.                                        |
| 01:25:21   | If you like [[Drafts]], we talked about [[Drafts]].                        |
| 01:25:23   | Rose did a really great job of reviewing the app                   |
| 01:25:25   | over at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/).                                               |
| 01:25:26   | We'll put a link in the show notes.                                |
| 01:25:28   | And I did the introductory video for the [[Drafts]] for Mac.           |

| 01:25:33   | just kind of walking through how it works.                         |

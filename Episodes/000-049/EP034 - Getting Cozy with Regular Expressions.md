| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators, I'm David Sparks and I'm joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard                            |
| 00:07      | and this is Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology and make it                           |
| 00:11      | do your bidding for you.                                                                                          |
| 00:13      | Hello Rosemary.                                                                                                   |
| 00:14      | Hey David, how are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:16      | Excellent.                                                                                                        |
| 00:17      | I am excited today to talk about regular expressions.                                                             |
| 00:21      | Ooh, fun.                                                                                                         |
| 00:23      | It looks like a spider just ran across my keyboard and typed on everything.                                       |
| 00:26      | What happened?                                                                                                    |
| 00:27      | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                                               |
| 00:28      | Well, maybe it's a regular expression.                                                                            |
| 00:30      | We'll have to do the show and find out.                                                                           |
| 00:35      | If you're reaching for the knob right now, don't because regular expressions is something                         |
| 00:38      | everybody can do.                                                                                                 |
| 00:40      | It sounds like a programmer thing, programmers use it all the time, but even as normal folks                      |
| 00:45      | can find a use for a regular expression, what it really is, is a fancy way to search text                         |
| 00:51      | and it gives you text searching superpowers if you take the time to learn it and it won't                         |
| 00:58      | take that long.                                                                                                   |
| 00:59      | Yes, and that is a promise.                                                                                       |
| 01:01      | It really doesn't take a lot of time to learn this and we have a bunch of tools up our sleeves                    |
| 01:05      | for this show, which will actually pretty much write your irregular expressions for                               |
| 01:09      | you.                                                                                                              |
| 01:10      | So keep listening.                                                                                                |
| 01:12      | Yeah, I thought I'd start by just telling you one of my best uses of regular expressions                          |
| 01:18      | as a lawyer.                                                                                                      |
| 01:20      | I get in these disputes once in a while where we get all these documents.                                         |
| 01:26      | Lawyers are weird people and a lot of times when you send a demand for documents and there's                      |
| 01:31      | like one or two good documents that we really need to prove our case, they'll bury it in                          |
| 01:36      | 20 boxes worth of documents and it's the needle in the haystack problem.                                          |
| 01:41      | But the way I would solve that is I would just have the documents scanned in [[OCR]] and                          |
| 01:47      | we would combine that into one big [[OCR]] file, which is a lot of words, but I'd use [[BBEdit]],                 |
| 01:55      | which is a great application.                                                                                     |
| 01:56      | It's actually made for web programming, really, but a lot of people are writing it as well.                       |
| 02:01      | And I would take [[BBEdit]] because you can throw anything at it and I'd put all this text in                     |
| 02:04      | it and I would run a regular expression against it and a regular expression would be a very                       |
| 02:10      | complex kind of search that I would run, finding a specific set of text within the document                       |
| 02:17      | and I was always able to find what I wanted and everybody could never believe how I could                         |
| 02:23      | always dig up the one piece of information we needed out of all this information and                              |
| 02:28      | the answer was regular expressions.                                                                               |
| 02:31      | Yes, and if you think of this, some people may be going, well, maybe I don't really have                          |
| 02:36      | that kind of information.                                                                                         |
| 02:37      | Well, there's a lot of other ways that you can use it as well.                                                    |
| 02:40      | So I'll give you one of my examples, which is one I literally used it just before we                              |
| 02:44      | started the show because I booked some flights yesterday.                                                         |
| 02:47      | They're now in my calendar thanks to [[Tripit]].                                                                  |
| 02:50      | And say I had just this flight information from somewhere else, I often need to get the                           |
| 02:55      | flight number at the origin location so that I can add it to [[OmniFocus]] with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] to |
| 03:00      | check in.                                                                                                         |
| 03:02      | And getting that information, well, what is a flight number?                                                      |
| 03:05      | A flight number is two or three letters followed by two to four numbers.                                          |
| 03:11      | And well, the letters, they could be any combination of letters because there are lots of different               |
| 03:17      | airlines and the numbers, well, you can have anywhere from one up to 9,999.                                       |
| 03:24      | If I'm just doing a Control-F for that, I'm going to be there for a very long time.                               |
| 03:28      | But if I do a Control-F and turn on [[grep]] or regular expressions or regex, depending                           |
| 03:33      | on the program, funnily enough, I have it right under my fingertips.                                              |
| 03:38      | And as it turns out, I actually do this one with shortcuts.                                                       |
| 03:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 03:42      | So you can look for a number in a particular format or words in a particular format with                          |
| 03:49      | regular expressions as well.                                                                                      |
| 03:50      | And it's just really powerful once you stop to learn it.                                                          |
| 03:54      | Now, you just said something really quick.                                                                        |
| 03:56      | I want to go back over regex.                                                                                     |
| 03:59      | It's sometimes called that regular expressions.                                                                   |
| 04:01      | It's called '[[grep]]'.                                                                                           |
| 04:03      | There's different names for it.                                                                                   |
| 04:06      | But the whole idea is this search terminology where you do something, and I think we'll                           |
| 04:11      | do one easy regular expression, and that's the period, which is the wild card.                                    |
| 04:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 04:19      | That's a really useful one.                                                                                       |
| 04:21      | So just give an example of that.                                                                                  |
| 04:22      | Well, I mean, a period matches anything because it's a magic matcher, if you want to call                         |
| 04:30      | it something, and it will match anything, excluding a new line.                                                   |
| 04:34      | So for example, if I put six dots in a row, then it will match anything that is six in                            |
| 04:43      | length or the first six of something.                                                                             |
| 04:46      | And that's really, really useful because I don't have to specify, hey, is this a letter                           |
| 04:51      | or is it a space or is it a number?                                                                               |
| 04:53      | It just grabs any of those.                                                                                       |
| 04:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 04:56      | And if you do the regular expression "ca.", then it'll look for any three-letter word                             |
| 05:05      | because that dot just represents one letter.                                                                      |
| 05:07      | We're going to talk later about how to fix that.                                                                  |
| 05:10      | But any three-letter word, it starts with the letters "ca", so it'll find "cat" and "can".                        |
| 05:16      | It will not find "coat".                                                                                          |
| 05:17      | Well, actually, it doesn't start with "ca", does it?                                                              |
| 05:20      | Aha.                                                                                                              |
| 05:21      | There you go.                                                                                                     |
| 05:22      | It will find a four-letter word starting with "ca", but it will find anything.                                    |
| 05:28      | It'll use that period, essentially, as anything.                                                                  |
| 05:30      | If you've ever played poker, you've had wild cards, jokers wild, deuces wild, it's the                            |
| 05:36      | same thing as a wild card in poker.                                                                               |
| 05:39      | It can be literally any card in the deck.                                                                         |
| 05:41      | In this case, it can be any number or letter in the alphabet.                                                     |
| 05:45      | So that is a regular expression.                                                                                  |
| 05:48      | So if you search one of these mini-programs that do regular expressions and type "ca.",                           |
| 05:55      | guess what?                                                                                                       |
| 05:56      | You just did a regular expression.                                                                                |
| 05:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 05:59      | And what you should double-check with any program that you're using to do this because                            |
| 06:03      | there are some programs, for example, [[OmniFocus]] supports regular expressions in their search.                 |
| 06:07      | Did you know that?                                                                                                |
| 06:08      | Maybe not.                                                                                                        |
| 06:09      | But if you open up the search function of a program like [[BBEdit]] or [[OmniFocus]] or [[Drafts]],               |
| 06:16      | then you can usually turn on and off the regular expressions, which is really useful because                      |
| 06:20      | sometimes you might want to actually match a period and you don't care about regular                              |
| 06:25      | expressions.                                                                                                      |
| 06:26      | So you can just turn that feature off.                                                                            |
| 06:28      | But if you do want a match period, then you need to put a backslash in front of it to                             |
| 06:33      | escape it, and then you're matching the actual period.                                                            |
| 06:35      | So then you're matching anything that is "ca." if you type "ca\\.".                                               |
| 06:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 06:41      | Like if you, like an example with the period, you can use multiple of these wildcard periods.                     |
| 06:46      | So let's say you say, I know the guy has a phone number and it starts out 987, but then                           |
| 06:53      | there's four digits after that I don't remember.                                                                  |
| 06:55      | In that case, you could do a regular expression for "987....", right?                   |
| 07:02      | And it would search for any number starting with "987: and having four characters afterwards.                       |
| 07:10      | And actually, as we get through the show, you're going to find out there's much better                            |
| 07:12      | ways to do that.                                                                                                  |
| 07:13      | But just as a basic example, that's another regular expression.                                                   |
| 07:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 07:17      | And it's really useful, especially if, for example, you have put a document through [[OCR]]                           |
| 07:22      | and you're looking for something in particular and you're not finding it with more complex                        |
| 07:26      | regular expressions that we'll get to later in the show, try falling back to the dot because                      |
| 07:31      | the way programs do that [[optical character recognition\|OCR]] may mean that you've actually                             |
| 07:36      | got something unexpected in there, which to us as humans, it's very clear, hey, this                              |
| 07:40      | is an em-dash, but it turns out it's come out as a hyphen.                                                        |
| 07:44      | It's very useful to just be able to go, hey, I'll just put a dot and then I'll get either                         |
| 07:47      | of those.                                                                                                         |
| 07:49      | And it will also get anything else.                                                                               |
| 07:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 07:51      | The other one that I always catch that way is the zero and the 'O'. Sometimes [[OCR]] will                              |
| 07:57      | find you're searching for a digit and it doesn't find it.                                                         |
| 08:01      | But then if you search for capital 'O', it finds it.                                                                |
| 08:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 08:05      | And that's a neat trick that you'll want to bear in mind, especially if you have a                                |
| 08:10      | bunch of data that you scanned in, maybe you've put it through a scanner with one of those                        |
| 08:14      | feeders on top.                                                                                                   |
| 08:15      | Those are extremely useful if you're going paperless, but then you have to find the data                          |
| 08:20      | afterwards.                                                                                                       |
| 08:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 08:22      | Well, in regular expressions, as Rosa was saying, is in a lot of places, [[OmniFocus]] is                             |
| 08:28      | the place I use it.                                                                                               |
| 08:29      | I've got a big enough database that regular expressions help me kind of find things if                            |
| 08:32      | I lose them, [[Drafts]] is another great one.                                                                     |
| 08:36      | Of course, he's going to support regular expressions because that's what [[Greg Pierce\|Greg]] does.                               |
| 08:43      | [[Shortcuts]], we're going to talk later in the show about it because the shortcuts, regular                          |
| 08:45      | expressions really give shortcuts an extra power boost and I want to talk about that                              |
| 08:52      | later because it's kind of complicated.                                                                           |
| 08:54      | But the application that I think would be best if you wanted to really kind of give                               |
| 08:58      | this a try for the first time is [[BBEdit]].                                                                      |
| 09:01      | There is a brand new version of [[BBEdit]] that just came out as we record the show, version                      |
| 09:06      | 13.                                                                                                               |
| 09:08      | They have a free, I believe it's a 30-day trial.                                                                  |
| 09:11      | And [[BBEdit]] has always been kind of one of the best places to do regular expressions.                          |
| 09:16      | It's actually the software documentation is where I first started learning regular expressions.                   |
| 09:22      | It's really well-written.                                                                                         |
| 09:23      | Yes, it is.                                                                                                       |
| 09:24      | You can find that in the help menu or you can find it on that website, we'll put a link                           |
| 09:28      | to it in the show notes because even if you are, for example, an iPad first user and you                          |
| 09:32      | don't have a Mac, so you can't install [[BBEdit]], well, you don't have to miss out on their                      |
| 09:37      | manual because it's on their website as a PDF and the chapter on regular expressions,                             |
| 09:41      | I have to say, is very good reading, which sounds very strange or something that's so                             |
| 09:45      | technical, but it's very useful.                                                                                  |
| 09:48      | Yeah, and they also, with this newest version, I feel like they've really embraced their                          |
| 09:53      | role as the regular expressions machine because they have, they call it a lab where you can                       |
| 10:00      | write a regular expression and have text underneath it and it will live search the text while                     |
| 10:06      | you are writing the regular expressions so you can see exactly what you're triggering                             |
| 10:10      | with your regular expressions.                                                                                    |
| 10:11      | So getting back to the thing we had earlier about the zero versus the capital 'O' or the                            |
| 10:15      | dash versus the em-dash, you can see live on your documents if there's a problem and it's                          |
| 10:23      | just really convenient and they even have cheat sheets built into that where you can                              |
| 10:29      | get a list of all the regular expression terms and we're going to go over those after the                         |
| 10:33      | break, but to have that there as you're writing the expression is really useful.                                  |
| 10:38      | Definitely.                                                                                                       |
| 10:39      | I highly recommend giving this a play because even if you are going to be mostly using regular                    |
| 10:45      | expressions in shortcuts, having a quick reference and an ability to check this is something                      |
| 10:52      | that you definitely need.                                                                                         |
| 10:53      | And we will talk about some other things later in the show that will help you do this, but                        |
| 10:56      | [[BBEdit]] I would say is not the gold standard, maybe the diamond standard because it's just                     |
| 11:01      | been there for so long doing such a great job at this.                                                            |
| 11:04      | Yeah, it sounds like it's sponsored by [[BBEdit]] this show, but it's not.                                        |
| 11:08      | It's really not.                                                                                                  |
| 11:09      | Yeah, but it is really great and like I said, you can get that free trial if you want to                          |
| 11:13      | buy it, it's not that expensive, but just for the process of learning regular expressions,                        |
| 11:17      | you could do that within the free trial period.                                                                   |
| 11:19      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 11:20      | Speaking of sponsors, we have a sponsor.                                                                          |

| 11:32      | data from emails to spreadsheets to whatever else.                                                                |
| 11:36      | Why don't you automate that?                                                                                      |

| 12:31      | I signed up for Zapier because we covered it here on the show.                                                    |
| 12:34      | I wanted to test it out, and I have become a pain member because I love the way Zapier                            |
| 12:39      | helps with all of my web services.                                                                                |
| 12:42      | For example, with the law practice, when I sign up a new client, I've got things that                             |
| 12:46      | need to happen in Basecamp and in the billing program and over in [[Airtable]].                                   |
| 12:52      | Well, Zapier connects with all those apps.                                                                        |
| 12:54      | So we just put the data in once, and it just shows up everywhere.                                                 |
| 12:57      | It saves us a bunch of time, it's more efficient, and it's more accurate.                                         |
| 13:01      | And I love it, so I'm a paying member.                                                                              |
| 13:05      | So go there now.                                                                                                  |

| 13:18      | Our thanks to Zapier for the support of automators and all of Relay FM.                                           |
| 13:24      | So Rose, let's talk about creating regular expressions.                                                           |
| 13:28      | We already covered the wild card, the period, but there's so much more.                                           |
| 13:31      | One of them that I think probably we should, we could talk about first is, what if you                            |
| 13:36      | want to search for a period, which is also the wild card character?                                               |
| 13:41      | Yeah, and I briefly mentioned this before, which is you need to escape certain things.                            |
| 13:48      | And to escape something is basically a programming term for saying, hey, don't treat this the                     |
| 13:52      | way that you think you should be treated.                                                                         |
| 13:54      | Treat it as exactly what I've written.                                                                            |
| 13:57      | And to escape something, you put a backslash before it.                                                           |
| 14:01      | So if you want a period or a full stop as I would usually call them, then you do a backslash                      |
| 14:06      | followed by a period or a full stop.                                                                              |
| 14:08      | They are the same thing.                                                                                          |
| 14:09      | I think I'm going to start calling them full stops.                                                               |
| 14:12      | That sounds a way classier.                                                                                       |
| 14:13      | Well, that's what I grew up calling them.                                                                         |
| 14:15      | So I'm biased thinking it's better.                                                                               |
| 14:17      | Now, is that throughout the UK?                                                                                   |
| 14:19      | That's what you call it?                                                                                          |
| 14:20      | Yeah, it is.                                                                                                      |
| 14:21      | Okay.                                                                                                             |
| 14:22      | Because to me, full stop is like, we're heading towards an iceberg and we got to stop this                        |
| 14:27      | vessel.                                                                                                           |
| 14:28      | You know, the full stop.                                                                                          |
| 14:29      | I mean, but...                                                                                                    |
| 14:30      | Well, you have to do a full stop at the end of your sentence because otherwise you don't                          |
| 14:33      | have the time to pause and breathe and then start your next sentence again.                                       |
| 14:37      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 14:38      | Well, a full stop or a period is a wild card, but backslash full stop is just a full stop.                        |
| 14:45      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 14:46      | And you'll want to use this with other certain, so other penetration as well.                                     |
| 14:50      | So for example, the hyphen or a dash would also probably need escaping.                                           |
| 14:58      | And so do some other things, for example, the star or the plus or the question work.                              |
| 15:03      | In general, think about punctuation.                                                                              |
| 15:05      | And if your regular expression is not doing what you want, try escaping it.                                       |
| 15:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 15:10      | So let's talk about some of those that you just mentioned, starting with the dash.                                |
| 15:14      | So you can search for literal letters.                                                                            |
| 15:16      | Like when we did our cat example earlier,"ca." to search for anything that                              |
| 15:23      | starts with the letters "ca".                                                                                       |
| 15:24      | But you can also search for ranges of letters or even better numbers.                                             |
| 15:29      | So if you had zero hyphen three, it would look for any number between zero and three.                             |
| 15:37      | You need to make sure that you put your ranges in square brackets because a square bracket                        |
| 15:41      | is what tells regular expression that you want to have some magic happen on this, essentially.                    |
| 15:48      | And square brackets have a lot of uses.                                                                           |
| 15:50      | But for example, inside your square brackets, you can write "0-3", which means                          |
| 15:55      | it'll match zero, one, two, or three.                                                                             |
| 15:59      | It'll grab any one of those, which is really useful because if you do square brackets "0-9"                        |
| 16:06      | close square bracket, it'll match any number, any single number, just one-digit                        |
| 16:13      | numbers, but it'll match any single number for you.                                                               |
| 16:15      | And that's really useful.                                                                                         |
| 16:17      | And of course, you can limit this, so you could do four dash nine, so it'll match anything                        |
| 16:21      | between four and nine as well.                                                                                    |
| 16:23      | Yeah, and so that square bracket, and I should have said that, is it designates one digit.                        |
| 16:28      | So that's why you're kind of putting the "0-3" inside it.                                             |
| 16:32      | But you can also have a search for specific digits or letters as well.                                            |
| 16:39      | So like give an example of that, Rose.                                                                            |
| 16:41      | Well, for example, with our zero to three, if maybe we just want zero or three, then                              |
| 16:46      | you can do open square bracket, "03", close square bracket, and it won't match                             |
| 16:50      | one or two, it will just match zero and three folks.                                                            |
| 16:55      | And that's where you get in trouble sometimes, because you may say, you want to search between                    |
| 16:59      | the numbers 20 and 22, right?                                                                                     |
| 17:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 17:03      | So if you put "20-22", it's going to search for the number two, or the number zero                           |
| 17:09      | through two, or the number two.                                                                                   |
| 17:12      | So that you suddenly find yourself, these computers are smart, but they're also really                            |
| 17:17      | dumb.                                                                                                             |
| 17:18      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 17:19      | And that's where you have to remember, a computer is only as smart as the person telling                          |
| 17:23      | it what to do.                                                                                                    |
| 17:24      | And we are all very smart, but we're not necessarily very good at telling our computers exactly                   |
| 17:28      | what it is that we want them to do.                                                                               |
| 17:30      | And so it's going to do exactly what you tell it, which is why having something like the                          |
| 17:35      | pattern playgrounds feature in [[BBEdit]] is really useful, because you can try all of this,                      |
| 17:40      | and especially when it gets to using the replace feature, then you can look through and see                       |
| 17:44      | what it's actually done with this magic that you've told it to do, and see whether or not                         |
| 17:50      | it had the intended side effects, or maybe if it went a little off the rails, which it                            |
| 17:54      | will happen when you're learning these regular expressions.                                                       |
| 17:57      | But you can also use it to your advantage, like that problem was talking about earlier,                           |
| 18:01      | where [[OCR]] often confuses zero and capital 'O'. If you put a square bracket with a zero                              |
| 18:08      | and a capital 'O' in it, and close bracket, no dash, it's looking for either a zero or                              |
| 18:15      | a capital 'O'. So if you're worried your [[OCR]] confused the number for the letter, the regular                        |
| 18:21      | expressions will find for you, where if you just did a normal search, it would never find                         |
| 18:26      | that.                                                                                                             |
| 18:27      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 18:28      | And so then to enhance this, say you wanted to match any digit or a capital 'O' because that                        |
| 18:35      | frequently happens with [[OCR]], then you could have your square bracket, have a capital 'O',                           |
| 18:40      | zero dash nine, and close your square bracket, and it's going to match any of those, which                        |
| 18:45      | gives you all of the numbers and the possible misunderstood zero.                                                 |
| 18:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 18:50      | And we're trying to take this low.                                                                                |
| 18:51      | It's hard to cover this stuff in audio only.                                                                      |
| 18:54      | I know you're driving down a freeway somewhere and listening to this, but if you can picture                      |
| 18:59      | in your head, this stuff really is not that difficult once you wrap your head around it.                          |
| 19:05      | We talked about ranges, often they're used with numbers.                                                          |
| 19:07      | You can also use them with letters.                                                                               |
| 19:09      | Like if you wanted to search for "ca", open bracket, "a-m", it would find "can" because "n" follows                       |
| 19:22      | between "a" and "m", but it would not find "cat" because "cat" is outside that range.                                     |
| 19:28      | Well, it will find "n" if your alphabet is a little bit different, "m" comes before "n" in the                            |
| 19:32      | alphabet.                                                                                                         |
| 19:35      | This is where you have to be careful, though, because you want to make sure that it's there.                      |
| 19:39      | So it will find "cad", but it won't find "can".                                                                       |
| 19:43      | Sometimes podcasting is hard.                                                                                     |
| 19:46      | It is.                                                                                                            |
| 19:47      | Let's just say that.                                                                                              |
| 19:48      | Okay.                                                                                                             |
| 19:49      | It's okay.                                                                                                        |
| 19:50      | We'll just dig on you in the forums, David.                                                                       |
| 19:52      | It's okay.                                                                                                        |
| 19:53      | I'm just used to saying the alphabet backwards when I get pulled over.                                            |
| 19:56      | Oh, there we go.                                                                                                  |
| 19:58      | The secret life of David Sparks.                                                                                  |
| 20:00      | Oh, boy.                                                                                                          |
| 20:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 20:03      | So you can limit your alphabet, which is back to our point.                                                       |
| 20:07      | So if, for example, you didn't want the letter 'N', for example, the letter 'N' is definitely                         |
| 20:11      | not appearing, then you could fetch 'A' through to 'M' and then 'O' through to 'Z'. And you can                           |
| 20:17      | put these all in square brackets.                                                                                 |
| 20:19      | So you would open your square bracket, put "a-mo-z" and close.                                            |
| 20:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 20:26      | And that's it.                                                                                                    |
| 20:27      | And make sure that you are using the right kind of brackets.                                                      |
| 20:29      | For the ranges, these are square brackets (`[` `]`).                                                                        |
| 20:33      | Now on my keyboard, I have the American layout and I also have a British layout right next                        |
| 20:37      | to it for comparison.                                                                                             |
| 20:39      | These are the second row down there next to the 'P' and they don't use modifier keys.                               |
| 20:44      | And you need to make sure that you're using the right kind of brackets.                                           |
| 20:48      | And as always, make sure your brackets match because if your brackets don't match, then                           |
| 20:52      | your regular expression is probably just going to not work, which is safer than it going                          |
| 20:57      | completely off the rails, but double check.                                                                       |
| 21:00      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 21:01      | Now I want to go back to the telephone number search because we've learned more and I want                        |
| 21:06      | to apply that.                                                                                                    |
| 21:07      | So we could have a telephone search and we're going to use the US format where it's three                         |
| 21:13      | digits dash three digits dash four digits.                                                                        |
| 21:16      | So one way you could do that, and this isn't the end of the road for the telephone search.                        |
| 21:21      | We're going to come back to it throughout the show.                                                               |
| 21:23      | But one way you could do that is you could have the square brackets with zero through                             |
| 21:27      | nine.                                                                                                             |
| 21:28      | So that is representing any digit.                                                                                |
| 21:29      | You could have three of those.                                                                                    |
| 21:32      | And then you'd have a dash and then you have three more, then you have a dash, then you                           |
| 21:36      | have four more.                                                                                                   |
| 21:37      | Now there's one problem though, the dash doesn't mean dash in regular expression.                                 |
| 21:42      | So you'd have to escape the dash.                                                                                 |
| 21:43      | So to fix that, you'd have to put a backslash before each dash.                                                   |
| 21:46      | So then it'd be the zero through nine in square brackets, three times the backslash dash,                         |
| 21:53      | then three times backslash dash, then four times backslash dash.                                                  |
| 21:57      | And if you ran that regular expression, which hopefully isn't that hard to visualise, it                          |
| 22:02      | would look through as much text as you will throw at it and it'll find every phone number                         |
| 22:07      | formatted that way.                                                                                               |
| 22:09      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 22:10      | And this is great, assuming that the phone number is formatted the right way.                                     |
| 22:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 22:14      | But we can get to that.                                                                                           |
| 22:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 22:16      | Well, this is going to get easier as we get through.                                                              |
| 22:18      | It is.                                                                                                            |
| 22:19      | It's going to get a lot easier.                                                                                   |
| 22:20      | Can you explain negative characters to folks, Rose, because that's another big deal with                          |
| 22:25      | regular expressions.                                                                                              |
| 22:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 22:27      | So say for example, we already mentioned the letter 'N'. So we wanted to match anything                             |
| 22:32      | but the letter 'N'. We had 'A' through to 'M' and 'O' through to 'Z'. And this sounds like a lot                            |
| 22:36      | of work.                                                                                                          |
| 22:37      | Well, using our ranges again, we can put the carrot or the little hat symbol, as it's                             |
| 22:44      | sometimes known, it shift six on my keyboard.                                                                    |
| 22:46      | It's like a little upward pointing arrow.                                                                         |
| 22:48      | So you can open your square bracket and put a little caret in there.                                             |
| 22:51      | Not carrot is in [[Carrot Weather]], but caret as in C-A-R-E-T. And then you put the thing                           |
| 22:57      | that you don't want.                                                                                              |
| 22:58      | So for example, the letter 'N', and then you close your square bracket and then it will                             |
| 23:01      | match anything except your letter 'N', because that's what regular expressions do.                                  |
| 23:07      | Now in the UK, is the caret like got some other name like full stop does for period?                             |
| 23:13      | I don't believe so.                                                                                               |
| 23:15      | I think I've actually only used it in French.                                                                     |
| 23:18      | So it's a carry.                                                                                                  |
| 23:19      | But yes, I'm not sure.                                                                                            |
| 23:21      | Maybe it does.                                                                                                    |
| 23:22      | You're so fancy Rose.                                                                                             |
| 23:23      | I'm sorry.                                                                                                        |
| 23:24      | And you know the alphabet.                                                                                        |
| 23:26      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                |
| 23:29      | We all have our challenges.                                                                                       |
| 23:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 23:31      | So the caret is a good way to remove something.                                                                  |
| 23:35      | So if going back to the example, like if you put, if you want to, if you want to search                           |
| 23:39      | for "ca", but not find cat, you would type "ca\[^t]".                            |
| 23:47      | And that way it would search for "ca" and any letter that is not a 'T', or actually any digit                        |
| 23:52      | that's not a 'T'. So it can be a letter or a number.                                                                |
| 23:56      | And that also comes in handy when you're doing these searches.                                                    |
| 24:00      | So there are some words in the English language which don't have thousands.                                       |
| 24:04      | And say for example, you had a challenge and you needed to find all of the words that did                         |
| 24:08      | not have any, didn't have a vowel in.                                                                             |
| 24:11      | And so you just want to match everything that isn't a vowel is your starting point.                               |
| 24:14      | Well, you could do that because you open your square bracket, you put the little caret,                          |
| 24:18      | and then you go A-E-I-O-U and you close it and it will match everything that isn't a                              |
| 24:23      | vowel.                                                                                                            |
| 24:24      | Now you're going to want to refine this and improve it because it just matching everything                        |
| 24:30      | that's not a vowel is not going to find you just the words that have no vowel.                                    |
| 24:34      | It's going to find you all of the characters that aren't vowels, so it's also going to                            |
| 24:39      | find 0, 3, 9 and everything else.                                                                                 |
| 24:40      | But that's a really useful place to start if you for some reason really don't like                                |
| 24:44      | vowels today.                                                                                                     |
| 24:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 24:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 24:47      | Now, it gets easier though because in addition to searching inside these brackets, regular                        |
| 24:54      | expressions has kind of made a shorthand for you.                                                                 |
| 24:57      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 24:58      | So the digits we were talking about, the concept of open bracket, 0-9, close bracket, so it's                     |
| 25:05      | looking for any digit.                                                                                            |
| 25:07      | Well, there is a shortcut character for that and that is just backslash lowercase 'd'.                              |
| 25:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 25:16      | So.                                                                                                               |
| 25:17      | And this is so useful because now instead of typing five characters to match any digit,                           |
| 25:22      | well you can type two backslash to the lowercase 'd'.                                                               |
| 25:25      | Now the case is important here because you could also flip this.                                                  |
| 25:29      | You can say, hey, I don't want any digits, which with our ranges would be open bracket                            |
| 25:36      | caret 0 through 9 with through being the dash and close square bracket.                                           |
| 25:42      | Well if you capitalise the 'd', then you are going to exclude that.                                                 |
| 25:48      | And if you just think of 'd' for digit as in digits being numbers, then hopefully you can                           |
| 25:53      | remember this because lowercase matches a digit whereas uppercase doesn't match a digit.                          |
| 26:00      | Yeah, so "\\d" give me all the digits, lowercase that is "\\D" gives                         |
| 26:05      | me none of the digits.                                                                                            |
| 26:07      | And let's go back to the telephone number again.                                                                  |
| 26:09      | Now it's easier.                                                                                                  |
| 26:10      | It's backslash d three times than an escape dash than another three digits than an escape                         |
| 26:17      | dash than four digits.                                                                                            |
| 26:19      | So our regular expression is getting tighter as we work our way through the show.                                 |
| 26:26      | And that is a very easy way to do it.                                                                             |
| 26:27      | If you had a phone number where you knew partially what it was and you wanted to search it, you                   |
| 26:33      | would just replace the backslash d with the partial numbers you have where they fit in                            |
| 26:39      | the phone number.                                                                                                 |
| 26:40      | Yeah, so say for example you know that the last four digits, they start with a nine and                           |
| 26:44      | they end with a four.                                                                                             |
| 26:46      | Well, you can do nine backslash d backslash d four and then it's going to find any digit                          |
| 26:51      | that goes between those two and you're good.                                                                      |
| 26:55      | There's also a shorthand for words and I'll give you one guess what the shortcut is for                           |
| 27:03      | a word.                                                                                                           |
| 27:04      | Can I, can I take this one?                                                                                       |
| 27:06      | Can I get the point?                                                                                              |
| 27:07      | Am I allowed to do that?                                                                                          |
| 27:08      | Yeah, yes you do.                                                                                                 |
| 27:09      | Okay.                                                                                                             |
| 27:10      | Always Rose, you get all the points.                                                                              |
| 27:11      | Oh, thank you.                                                                                                    |
| 27:12      | Well, if you hadn't guessed it, it is indeed backslash 'w' lowercase matches any word character.                    |
| 27:18      | So that's A through to Z.                                                                                         |
| 27:20      | And backslash uppercase 'w', guess for it, guess it, go on.                                                           |
| 27:25      | I can hear people's brains going, it's not a word, not a word character.                                          |
| 27:29      | Well done.                                                                                                        |
| 27:30      | Full points to you.                                                                                               |
| 27:31      | If you are busy driving and you missed it, don't worry, come back, listen later and we                            |
| 27:34      | have plenty of resources in the show notes for you.                                                               |
| 27:37      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                                       |
| 27:38      | But this stuff just simplifies the regular expressions and suddenly, because if you don't                         |
| 27:44      | know anything about regular expressions and you look at one, it looks literally like a                            |
| 27:47      | spider did crawl across your keyboard.                                                                            |
| 27:49      | But the logic of it comes together pretty quickly if you just spent some time learning                            |
| 27:53      | it.                                                                                                               |
| 27:54      | Definitely.                                                                                                       |
| 27:55      | And this also extends.                                                                                            |
| 27:57      | So we have digits and we have words, but we have spaces.                                                          |
| 28:00      | Do you want to guess the space is one, David?                                                                     |
| 28:03      | Would that be 's'?                                                                                                  |
| 28:05      | Well done.                                                                                                        |
| 28:06      | Full points to David.                                                                                             |
| 28:07      | Yeah, lowercase 's' gives you white space.                                                                          |
| 28:10      | Yes, and uppercase 's' gives you something that's not white space.                                                  |
| 28:15      | So we've talked through it.                                                                                       |
| 28:18      | You've got these different ways to designate characters and then you assemble these into                          |
| 28:23      | the format of the word you're looking for.                                                                        |
| 28:26      | It's just so much more powerful than general search.                                                              |
| 28:29      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 28:30      | There's more to this, however.                                                                                    |
| 28:32      | I want to talk about that, but before we do that, let's hear from our next sponsor.                               |

| 29:34      | All right, Rose, so so far we've been focusing on regular expressions to designate a single                       |
| 29:40      | character, you know, the idea of like, like getting back to the full stop or the period.                          |
| 29:46      | It could be any character or we use those brackets to to narrow that list of what it                              |
| 29:52      | can be for that specific character.                                                                               |
| 29:55      | But you also need to deal with things where you don't know the exact position of characters                       |
| 30:00      | or the exact length of words.                                                                                     |
| 30:02      | How does regular expressions deal with that?                                                                      |
| 30:04      | Well, it has three ways of dealing with this.                                                                     |
| 30:07      | And you might go three ways, oh my gosh, kill me now.                                                             |
| 30:09      | Trust me, it's not it's not crazy.                                                                                |
| 30:11      | It's really, really useful.                                                                                       |
| 30:14      | Let's start with you need zero or one of something.                                                               |
| 30:19      | So for example, it may be actually there is a space in the phone number after around the                          |
| 30:25      | dashes.                                                                                                           |
| 30:26      | Okay, so you have your three dashes, three letters, and then instead of it just being                             |
| 30:31      | a dash.                                                                                                           |
| 30:32      | For example, maybe they were here on autopilot, who knows, they wrote space dash space, hmm.                      |
| 30:38      | But you don't want to have to write lots of regular expressions and run this multiple                             |
| 30:42      | times to find it.                                                                                                 |
| 30:43      | You want to make that optional.                                                                                   |
| 30:46      | And you can do that very simply by putting a question mark.                                                       |
| 30:49      | So if your space is optional, then you can do a "\\s" for space, and                              |
| 30:55      | then a question mark, which means match zero or one of these spaces.                                              |
| 31:00      | And that's so useful.                                                                                             |
| 31:02      | So if there's no space at all, like if they compress the number together, then it's still                         |
| 31:07      | going to find it.                                                                                                 |
| 31:08      | Exactly.                                                                                                          |
| 31:09      | And that's exactly what you need in that case like that.                                                          |
| 31:11      | And this continues and you can use this question mark on anything in a regular expression.                        |
| 31:17      | And you can use that also within brackets.                                                                        |
| 31:20      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 31:21      | And so the next one is what if you want, if something is optional, but maybe there's more                         |
| 31:28      | than one of something.                                                                                            |
| 31:29      | So they'll let the space key run away from them.                                                                  |
| 31:32      | Maybe they spill apple juice on their keyboard and their space key got stuck.                                     |
| 31:35      | I am not speaking from personal experience here at all.                                                           |
| 31:39      | Well, then you might need star because the star lets you match zero to an infinite number                         |
| 31:46      | of something.                                                                                                     |
| 31:47      | Now, you do need to be a little careful with this and the next one because it will keep                           |
| 31:52      | going until it finds the very last instance of whatever you're looking for.                                       |
| 31:57      | And so you can use a star.                                                                                        |
| 32:00      | So if, for example, there may be a space at the end of the phone number or there could                            |
| 32:03      | be 50 spaces, but we don't know, well, you can put a backslash lowercase s and then put                           |
| 32:08      | a star.                                                                                                           |
| 32:09      | And then it'll find it'll find anything with one or more spaces at the end or more spaces                         |
| 32:16      | for the star.                                                                                                     |
| 32:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 32:18      | Exactly.                                                                                                          |
| 32:19      | So and can you give an example of where you use that practically?                                                 |
| 32:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 32:24      | Well, for example, I often end up with code and sometimes I can't put it into my intelligent, sorry, ID, not                          |
| 32:33      | intelligent development environment, sorry, having more of those days.                                            |
| 32:37      | And I need to put it somewhere else and I just need to strip out a stupid amount of padding                       |
| 32:44      | at the start of a line.                                                                                           |
| 32:46      | But some lines don't have padding and I just need to flatten it all because it's all a                            |
| 32:50      | little bit over the place.                                                                                        |
| 32:51      | And then I can just match, so any white space character, so "\\s*"                        |
| 32:59      | and I just replace it with nothing.                                                                               |
| 33:01      | And that gets rid of all the spaces.                                                                              |
| 33:04      | Now I do need to be careful to make sure that I put this specifically at the start of the                         |
| 33:07      | line, but we'll get to that later in the show.                                                                    |
| 33:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 33:10      | And I feel like this one is particularly dangerous when you're working with words.                                |
| 33:13      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 33:14      | It can.                                                                                                           |
| 33:15      | It's easy to get yourself into trouble with that one.                                                             |
| 33:16      | And also the plus is a little dangerous to explain what the plus does.                                            |
| 33:20      | Well, the plus works the same way as the star does, but it says one or more.                                      |
| 33:24      | So star is zero or more and plus is one or more.                                                                  |
| 33:28      | So it's this plus anything else that you happen to find, which also matches the pattern that                      |
| 33:33      | was just before the plus, please.                                                                                 |
| 33:34      | Now, I don't use the plus or the start too often.                                                                 |
| 33:37      | I do use the question mark because that comes in handy like inside the bracket, you know,                         |
| 33:41      | getting back to the, getting back to the telephone number, you can solve the problem of saying,                   |
| 33:49      | is it a dash or is it a space or is it a no space?                                                                |
| 33:52      | You can do that inside a bracket with the question mark.                                                          |
| 33:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 33:55      | You put the question mark just after the bracket, but yes, you can put that there.                                |
| 34:00      | And that's really useful.                                                                                         |
| 34:01      | And I would caution you if you're seeing problems with your regular expression, have a look                       |
| 34:05      | at where you're using stars and pluses because that's often where you will go wrong because                       |
| 34:10      | they are very greedy and they keep going until they find the very last instance of whatever                       |
| 34:14      | it is that you're looking for.                                                                                    |
| 34:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 34:17      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 34:18      | So, that's kind of the basics.                                                                                    |
| 34:20      | We're not really going to teach you regular expressions that we want you to understand                            |
| 34:23      | the basics of how they work.                                                                                      |
| 34:25      | And we've been talking a lot today about how regular expressions are useful for search                            |
| 34:31      | and we're finding things and then you can act on them once you do.                                                |
| 34:35      | This is where the Automator part kicks in, but a lot of times people also use regular                             |
| 34:39      | expressions for search and replace.                                                                               |
| 34:42      | And that's where I think you have to be really careful.                                                           |
| 34:45      | Well, it doesn't mean that you need to be careful, but at the same time, it also means                            |
| 34:49      | that you can take, for example, that phone number and it doesn't matter if maybe they                             |
| 34:55      | use spaces instead of dashes or they use space-space to format the phone number.                                  |
| 35:00      | You can actually take that and have them all reformatted to whatever your preferred option                        |
| 35:06      | is.                                                                                                               |
| 35:07      | So, I have seen some US phone numbers with the first three digits in brackets followed                            |
| 35:11      | by three digits and then a dash and then four digits.                                                             |
| 35:14      | And so, you can easily do that with the search and replace if you use groups, which are probably                  |
| 35:21      | the next thing that we should talk about.                                                                         |
| 35:23      | All right, let's talk about groups then.                                                                          |
| 35:25      | Okay, well, we already had square brackets.                                                                       |
| 35:27      | Let's go for round brackets this time and that is what groups use.                                                |
| 35:31      | And so, if you put a chunk of your regular expression inside round brackets, that becomes                         |
| 35:36      | a group and then you can reference that later because what that does is that says to your                         |
| 35:42      | regular expression, hey, you're looking for all of this, but this particular part is something                    |
| 35:46      | that I want to call out.                                                                                          |
| 35:47      | All right, and give us an example of where you'd use that.                                                        |
| 35:50      | Well, for example, I do some video production for [[Screencasts Online]], which I'm really enjoying,                  |
| 35:56      | but the project management system that we use, it gives me an awful lot of data when                              |
| 36:00      | it triggers my [[Zapier]] app.                                                                                      |
| 36:03      | Full disclosure, [[Zapier]] is a sponsor of this episode, but I use [[Zapier]] personally as well,                        |
| 36:09      | but when it triggers my [[Zapier]] app, the project management tool, it's giving me loads                           |
| 36:13      | of information and I don't want all of this information.                                                          |
| 36:16      | And so, what I do is I use regular expressions to match the chunks of data, so for example,                       |
| 36:21      | the show number and the show title are the information I need, but if it's got my name                            |
| 36:25      | in it, well, most days I do know what my own name is, at least I hope I do.                                       |
| 36:30      | I'm David Sparks, right?                                                                                          |
| 36:32      | Yeah, that's me.                                                                                                  |
| 36:34      | At least you know the alphabet.                                                                                   |
| 36:36      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                |
| 36:38      | So I can just get rid of that, so I don't need that, but I do need to get this information                        |
| 36:42      | out of here.                                                                                                      |
| 36:43      | And so, I use groups, and I use the group to match the number, and I use a group to                               |
| 36:45      | match the title, and then I can take these and use them later in different parts of                               |
| 36:50      | my Zap.                                                                                                           |
| 36:51      | Yeah, that's really powerful, and that's the thing about this regular expression stuff.                           |
| 36:56      | Once you start understanding it, if you can appreciate how it works, you don't even have                          |
| 37:00      | to be an expert at it, you can always go back and relearn it.                                                     |
| 37:03      | I don't do it as often as Rose does, I feel like you're more fluent in it than I am.                              |
| 37:07      | Well, I am a programmer, so it comes with the territory.                                                          |
| 37:11      | So I have like a cheat sheet in my [[Apple Notes]] that I just keep dropping regular expressions                  |
| 37:15      | as I use them and kind of perfect them.                                                                           |
| 37:18      | But there is a good use for them, and a problem I had, I was working on a big, a client was                       |
| 37:23      | in the middle of an acquisition, and so we were doing all these meetings, and everybody                           |
| 37:28      | wanted the minutes following the meetings, and it was always just a pain in the neck                              |
| 37:32      | for me to find, you know, to get the meeting minutes and then to email them out to everybody                      |
| 37:39      | after the meeting, and I would forget about it, and then everybody would be mad at me.                            |
| 37:42      | So I used a regular expression to solve that problem with [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]], and I used a                            |
| 37:48      | sanitised version of this in the Shortcuts field guide, you can watch it and download                             |
| 37:52      | if you're subscribed to that.                                                                                     |
| 37:55      | But basically what it does is it's a regular expression that looks for the word distribution                      |
| 38:00      | with a colon after it, and then it looks for word patterns after that, and in the case                            |
| 38:07      | of the client thing I was doing, I was looking for the names of the specific individuals                          |
| 38:11      | that were involved in the transaction, for the sample one, it's Rose, Mike, and [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]],                          |
| 38:16      | you know, my podcast buddies, and what it does is it says, if you see the word distribution                       |
| 38:22      | colon and it has the word Rose after that, then I want you to take, that's the regular                            |
| 38:28      | expression, and then with [[Shortcuts]], you can say that essentially creates an if statement,                        |
| 38:34      | you know, you say, use regular expressions, look for word distribution followed by Rose.                          |
| 38:40      | If you see that, then do the following, and then it's just mechanics in [[Shortcuts]], but                        |
| 38:44      | what the mechanic is is it grabs the minutes and it adds them to an email, it prepares                            |
| 38:49      | an email to Rose with a subject line that says, here are the minutes, you know, and                               |
| 38:53      | then it sends the email off.                                                                                      |
| 38:55      | So all I have to do in order to make sure that the minutes get out is write the word                              |
| 39:00      | distribution colon at the bottom, and put the names of the people that I want them to                             |
| 39:04      | go to.                                                                                                            |
| 39:05      | And it's a regular expression driving the shortcut that goes through and does that.                               |
| 39:09      | And so if it sees Rose and it sees [[Myke Hurley\|Myke]], then it's going to send one to Rose and [[Myke Hurley\|Myke]].                            |
| 39:14      | If it sees [[Myke Hurley\|Myke]] and [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]], but not Rose, it will send it to [[Myke Hurley\|Myke]] and [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]], but not                           |
| 39:19      | Rose.                                                                                                             |
| 39:20      | And it's all just basic regular expressions.                                                                      |
| 39:23      | It's a one-line regular expression, but the stuff is not that difficult if you've never                           |
| 39:31      | done it before.                                                                                                   |
| 39:32      | I really want you to try if you're listening to this and you haven't gone down this road                          |
| 39:35      | before.                                                                                                           |
| 39:36      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 39:37      | And I would highly recommend that you do that, because going back to our groups option, well,                     |
| 39:42      | what happens if one day instead of writing Rose, you write Rosemary?                                              |
| 39:45      | Because some people do call me that, and that's okay.                                                             |
| 39:49      | And with the groups, you can do this.                                                                             |
| 39:50      | So you can open your RAM bracket and you can type Rose, and then you can put a pipe and                           |
| 39:54      | put Rosemary.                                                                                                     |
| 39:55      | And you can say, hey, if it has Rose or Rosemary, that's the same person, send them in, it's                      |
| 40:00      | over here.                                                                                                        |
| 40:01      | But if you call it Rosie, it won't match.                                                                         |
| 40:04      | I could never call you Rosie.                                                                                     |
| 40:05      | Oh, nobody calls me Rosie.                                                                                        |
| 40:07      | It's very strange.                                                                                                |
| 40:08      | I've never been used to it.                                                                                       |
| 40:10      | There was actually a girl in my primary school class called Rosie, and she was lovely, but                        |
| 40:15      | it was very clear.                                                                                                |
| 40:16      | She was Rosie and I was Rose.                                                                                     |
| 40:18      | And that was an easy way to tell us apart, name-wise.                                                             |
| 40:20      | I believe even when you were in primary school, you were all business.                                            |
| 40:25      | I confess, I did my maths exercise books during playtime because that's what I did at home,                       |
| 40:31      | because my dad was trying to make sure that I'd be good at maths.                                                 |
| 40:34      | By the way, it totally worked, and I'm very grateful to my dad for giving me all those                            |
| 40:37      | exercises.                                                                                                        |
| 40:38      | It was, you know, I got plenty of playtime too, but I was decent at maths, so I never                             |
| 40:43      | had a problem with that.                                                                                          |
| 40:44      | Yeah, but using groups, I could have done it either one.                                                          |
| 40:47      | Up in my head, do you prefer Rose or Rosemary?                                                                    |
| 40:50      | I don't mind.                                                                                                     |
| 40:51      | I'm one of those people who's quite ambivalent about it.                                                          |
| 40:54      | Just not Rosie.                                                                                                   |
| 40:55      | I want to make sure.                                                                                              |
| 40:57      | I'd hate to find out that you were cringing every time I called you Rose for the last                             |
| 41:01      | three years.                                                                                                      |
| 41:02      | Yes, I've secretly been super angry at David Sparks for three years.                                              |
| 41:05      | No.                                                                                                               |
| 41:06      | That's how you broke your ankle.                                                                                  |
| 41:08      | You were like, I said Rose, and you were like stomping your foot so hard.                                         |
| 41:12      | No, I'm still blaming that leaf for that.                                                                         |
| 41:15      | So yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 41:16      | I have a scooter now, and I take it all the time, and I think about you every time I get                          |
| 41:21      | on it.                                                                                                            |
| 41:22      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                |
| 41:24      | I will go down in history because of podcasting for something.                                                    |
| 41:27      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 41:30      | So that's an example of a regular expression with [[Shortcuts]].                                                      |
| 41:33      | So with [[Shortcuts]], there's just a couple of commands you use, but you need to learn                               |
| 41:37      | how to use the regular expressions.                                                                               |
| 41:38      | But you think about that.                                                                                         |
| 41:40      | The reason I love that regex so much is because it solved a problem that [[Shortcuts]] really                         |
| 41:45      | didn't have a tool for.                                                                                           |
| 41:47      | There isn't a tool in [[Shortcuts]] saying, look for the name Rose in this document and then                          |
| 41:54      | do something.                                                                                                     |
| 41:55      | It just doesn't have that ability.                                                                                |
| 41:58      | And more importantly, it would have to look for the name Rose only after the word distribution                    |
| 42:02      | colon because what if the word Rose or the letters R-O-S-E were part of some other word                           |
| 42:10      | in the document?                                                                                                  |
| 42:11      | I mean, I don't want it sending an email to Rose just because that happens.                                       |
| 42:14      | It has to be distribution colon Rose and I just don't think there's any other way to                              |
| 42:20      | do it.                                                                                                            |
| 42:21      | I mean, you could theoretically go through and have it split and look at certain lines                            |
| 42:25      | or something, but then you're doing something very hacky and you're doing an awful lot of                         |
| 42:28      | work to solve something that you can solve with a regular expression.                                             |
| 42:32      | Now there is, of course, the joke of if you have a problem and you solve it with a regular                        |
| 42:37      | expression, now you have two problems.                                                                            |
| 42:39      | And if you don't test your regular expression, that is absolutely the case.                                       |
| 42:44      | Always test because with everything else that we automate, it could have unintended side                          |
| 42:49      | effects.                                                                                                          |
| 42:50      | And I think that's saying is appropriate for complex regular expressions, but I would                             |
| 42:56      | guess a lot of people who's in the show are just looking for a phone number or looking                            |
| 43:00      | for something I explained, like a specific word followed by a variety of other words.                             |
| 43:06      | It's not that bad if you're doing the simple stuff.                                                               |
| 43:09      | Exactly.                                                                                                          |
| 43:10      | And yeah, that's what you need to start with.                                                                     |
| 43:12      | Always start with something simple that they can solve.                                                           |
| 43:14      | So say, for example, you regularly get appointments in a calendar that you're subscribed to, but                  |
| 43:20      | only some of these are relevant.                                                                                  |
| 43:22      | So once a week you run a shortcut and you pick out the events manually that are relevant                          |
| 43:26      | to you with a choose from list.                                                                                   |
| 43:28      | Well, you could automate that if they all contain something that's relevant, that's similar                       |
| 43:35      | every week, doesn't have to be the same because you can use a regular expression and you can                      |
| 43:39      | just have it filter for those and grab them and put them on the real calendar for you.                            |
| 43:44      | And that's something that you can do with regular expressions very easily.                                        |
| 43:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 43:50      | Let's talk a little bit about dates and regular expressions formatting them.                                      |
| 43:56      | If you're looking for dates in a big pile of text, I guess let's start with the best                              |
| 44:04      | way to write a date, in my opinion, four-digit year dash, two-digit month dash, two-digit                         |
| 44:09      | day.                                                                                                              |
| 44:10      | How would you do that?                                                                                            |
| 44:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 44:12      | Well, assuming that we're using that particular format, well, you could start with our backslash                  |
| 44:17      | lowercase 'd' and do four of those and then escape your dash.                                                       |
| 44:24      | And then do two more backslash 'd's then the dash and then two more backslash 'd's, but you could                       |
| 44:31      | also improve on this because instead of saying, hey, I'm going to type this out four times                        |
| 44:38      | to match four digits, well, we can actually use a regular expression to say, hey, I want                          |
| 44:44      | exactly four of these, please.                                                                                    |
| 44:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 44:48      | And that one is actually pretty simple.                                                                           |
| 44:51      | I think a more difficult one is the US way.                                                                       |
| 44:54      | I don't like the way we write dates here.                                                                         |
| 44:57      | I think the European method is better where it's day, space, month, spelled out, space,                           |
| 45:03      | year, like on a letter.                                                                                           |
| 45:06      | But instead we do it here, month, space, day, comma, space, year.                                                 |
| 45:13      | And that is a little more difficult because you've got different combinations of words.                           |
| 45:19      | There isn't like a grouping where you can say January, hyphen, December, it's going                               |
| 45:25      | to find all the months.                                                                                           |
| 45:26      | You've got to actually list the various months.                                                                   |
| 45:30      | And if you're looking for any month, then that becomes kind of a complicated expression.                          |
| 45:34      | Yes, it can do, which is why you would then probably end up trying to match any word that                         |
| 45:41      | comes between one or two digits days followed by, and then it would have to have a comma                          |
| 45:48      | and that would be followed by four digits.                                                                        |
| 45:50      | And that may capture some other stuff that you weren't intending it to do, but then you                           |
| 45:54      | would have to go through and filter that out.                                                                     |
| 45:56      | It is entirely possible to build a regular expression for something like that, but that's                         |
| 46:00      | where you start getting complex and that's where your regular expression could be creating                        |
| 46:05      | more problems than it solves.                                                                                     |
| 46:07      | Yeah, but it will if you use word instead of spelling out the months, you're going to                             |
| 46:11      | get everybody misspelled February, so it's good.                                                                  |
| 46:15      | One of the problems with that regular expression is the day digit.                                                |
| 46:21      | You might think, well, that would just be backslash 'd', backslash 'd', but that's not going to work                  |
| 46:26      | followed by a comma.                                                                                              |
| 46:27      | That's not going to work because what if it's February 7th?                                                       |
| 46:31      | There's only one digit.                                                                                           |
| 46:32      | So how do you solve that problem with a regular expression looking for one or two digits?                         |
| 46:37      | Well, what you could do, you could go back to our question mark for earlier and put backslash                     |
| 46:41      | 'd', backslash 'd', question mark, because then your second digit is optional, or you could                           |
| 46:46      | put the question mark on the first digit.                                                                         |
| 46:48      | However, we can use another element of regular expressions to solve this, which is the count.                     |
| 46:55      | And this is where we get to our third set of brackets for today.                                                  |
| 46:59      | This is the final set of brackets, I promise.                                                                     |
| 47:01      | And these are the curly brackets, and these are usually found on the same keys as the                             |
| 47:05      | square brackets, though I can't promise outside of English-speaking keyboards that it will                        |
| 47:08      | always be there.                                                                                                  |
| 47:11      | And so what you could do, if you want one or two, then you can open your curly bracket                            |
| 47:16      | with, right, one comma two, and close your curly bracket, and that means one or two of                            |
| 47:21      | these please.                                                                                                     |
| 47:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 47:23      | I solve it with the question mark.                                                                                |
| 47:25      | That's how I figured that one out, but you're better at this than I am.                                           |
| 47:30      | I will be the first to admit it.                                                                                  |
| 47:32      | Well, I wouldn't say I'm better because the question mark is something that you're already                        |
| 47:36      | familiar with is probably the better way to solve it.                                                             |
| 47:39      | But the curly bracket option has a few other tricks up its sleeve.                                                |
| 47:43      | More power.                                                                                                       |
| 47:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 47:45      | So, for example, that you only want two instances of digit.                                                       |
| 47:49      | Well, in this case, you're not going to save yourself any typing, but you can do backslash 'd'                       |
| 47:53      | open curly bracket, to close curly bracket.                                                                    |
| 47:57      | And this is going to give you exactly two of the digits.                                                          |
| 48:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 48:03      | I hope you're not banging your head against your steering wheel right now.                                        |
| 48:06      | No, please be looking at the road if you're driving.                                                              |
| 48:09      | This is definitely one of the more complex topics we've covered on the show, but it's                             |
| 48:13      | just if you can get some appreciation for the way you can combine this stuff with things                          |
| 48:17      | like [[Shortcuts]] or just use it with [[BBEdit]] on your Mac, it really is powerful.                                      |
| 48:22      | Yes, it definitely is.                                                                                            |
| 48:25      | And then you can take your curly brackets up an extra step if you like.                                           |
| 48:29      | So say, for example, that you want two or more digits.                                                            |
| 48:34      | So what you could do, open your curly brackets, put two comma, and then close your curly brackets.                |
| 48:40      | And then it will do two to infinity.                                                                              |
| 48:43      | And that can be useful for other things.                                                                          |
| 48:45      | I would not use that for dates because you're going to get some very unexpected things.                           |
| 48:51      | Somebody's written that some things could cost you $1 billion and they've got all of                              |
| 48:54      | those zeros in the document.                                                                                      |
| 48:55      | That's going to end up in there.                                                                                  |
| 48:57      | And unfortunately, billion is not valid as a date format, at least not yet.                                       |
| 49:01      | Might need a couple more million years to get to that point.                                                      |
| 49:04      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 49:05      | Well, we've got a couple more examples and we have some additional resources.                                     |
| 49:08      | If we've piqued your interests, we're going to give you some ideas of places to go.                               |
| 49:12      | But before we do that, I want to talk about our last sponsor.                                                     |
| 49:14      | That's our friends over at FreshBooks.                                                                            |
| 49:17      | You want to save 192 hours, you freelancers.                                                                      |
| 49:20      | FreshBooks can help you out with that.                                                                            |
| 49:23      | Just go to freshbooks.com/automators and let them know you heard about it here                                    |

| 49:34      | So what does FreshBooks do?                                                                                       |
| 49:35      | It allows you to get paid easier.                                                                                 |
| 49:38      | Isn't that a great idea?                                                                                          |
| 49:40      | They have a cloud accounting software system that just works.                                                     |
| 49:44      | By simplifying tasks like invoicing, tracking expenses, and getting paid online, FreshBooks                       |
| 49:49      | has drastically reduced the time it takes for over 10 million people to deal with their                           |
| 49:54      | paperwork.                                                                                                        |
| 49:55      | And I'm one of those 10 million.                                                                                  |
| 49:56      | I was realising I was doing my invoicing for MacSparky through pages documents and                                |
| 50:02      | the numbers spreadsheet that I tracked it on.                                                                     |
| 50:04      | And I was forgetting to follow up with customers and at some point when an invoice gets so                        |
| 50:10      | old, you just can't collect on it anymore because it's almost on you at that point.                               |
| 50:16      | So I decided that's crazy.                                                                                        |
| 50:17      | I signed up for a FreshBooks account a few years ago and now all my invoicing problems                            |
| 50:21      | are solved.                                                                                                       |
| 50:22      | It remembers my vendors, it remembers the transactions.                                                           |
| 50:26      | When I put it in, it sends them a nice email.                                                                     |
| 50:28      | It gives them a way to pay with their credit card right from the email.                                           |
| 50:33      | When I get paid faster and everything is just taken care of now with FreshBooks.                                  |
| 50:38      | They continue to make FreshBooks better with the service.                                                         |
| 50:41      | When you email a client and invoice, FreshBooks can show you whether they've seen it, which                       |
| 50:45      | puts an end to that guessing game, you know, did they see it or not.                                              |
| 50:49      | Also with a new projects feature, you can share files and messages with your clients                              |
| 50:54      | and contractors employees to see how quickly things happen and keep all your conversations                        |
| 51:00      | in one place.                                                                                                     |
| 51:01      | Now, if you're listening to this and not using FreshBooks, it's time to try it.                                   |

| 51:25      | So we've bored you to tears or hopefully piqued your interest and given you lots of                               |
| 51:31      | regular expressions.                                                                                              |
| 51:32      | Let's talk about a few more ways that we actually use these, shall we?                                            |
| 51:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 51:37      | You do some cool stuff in [[Drafts]] with regular expressions, right?                                             |
| 51:39      | I do.                                                                                                             |
| 51:40      | And this is where I'm going to tell you a little secret.                                                          |
| 51:44      | I cheat.                                                                                                          |
| 51:45      | So there are things called functions that you can use that will do regular expressions                            |
| 51:51      | for you.                                                                                                          |
| 51:52      | So for example, begins with and ends with and contains.                                                           |
| 51:56      | And if these sound familiar, that's because they're not just in [[JavaScript]] as a function.                     |
| 52:01      | They're also in [[Shortcuts]] and in many other applications.                                                         |
| 52:05      | And that is one of the big secrets to regular expressions.                                                        |
| 52:09      | You don't necessarily have to write everything yourself.                                                          |
| 52:12      | As long as you know what it is that you're looking for and how to specify this, you can                           |
| 52:18      | cheat a lot of the time and use something that somebody else has written to make it                               |
| 52:22      | work for you.                                                                                                     |
| 52:24      | And so I do use standard regular expressions if you want to call them that in [[Drafts]].                         |
| 52:29      | So for example, finding any item which is marked as a task, which in [[Drafts]], the way                          |
| 52:36      | that you start a task is you do dash space square bracket.                                                        |
| 52:40      | And then it could be an 'X' in the box if it's completed or space and then close square bracket                     |
| 52:47      | followed by something else.                                                                                       |
| 52:48      | Well, if I need to match the space or the square, the space or the 'X', then well, I use                            |
| 52:54      | a regular expression for that.                                                                                    |
| 52:56      | And I do cheat.                                                                                                   |
| 52:57      | I just use the period as you call it or the full stop and put that in there.                                      |
| 53:03      | But I also use begins with and ends with to help me find what it is that I'm looking                              |
| 53:08      | for.                                                                                                              |
| 53:09      | Like I'm just thinking about that shortcut that I wrote the regular expression for where                          |
| 53:14      | it starts with distribution contains rows.                                                                        |
| 53:17      | I think I could probably pull it off with a begins with distribution, you break it by                             |
| 53:21      | line and you look for a line that starts with distribution and contains rows.                                     |
| 53:26      | I think that would probably work the same.                                                                        |
| 53:28      | I'd have to go through and test it, but I think that would that would work fine.                                  |
| 53:31      | It would probably use more steps in your shortcut than you're currently using.                                    |
| 53:35      | But it's a 100% valid way of doing that.                                                                          |
| 53:39      | And it will solve your problem in the way that you're expecting, which is great.                                  |
| 53:44      | And that should give everybody who's there going, I'm not sure I'm going to remember                              |
| 53:47      | all of these hierarchal effects.                                                                                  |
| 53:49      | Well, they're not hierarchal effects, they're punctuation, but you can cheat and use functions.                   |
| 53:53      | And that's totally okay.                                                                                          |
| 53:56      | And I love doing that in [[Drafts]] because it's really useful.                                                   |
| 53:59      | But also it's handy when I'm just searching for something, I'm there going, wait, did                             |
| 54:03      | I spell customised with an 'S' or 'Z'?                                                                                  |
| 54:06      | Because am I writing in British English or American English?                                                      |
| 54:09      | Well, I can find either of those.                                                                                 |
| 54:10      | Yeah, it's just really powerful.                                                                                  |
| 54:14      | This stuff doesn't take that long to learn.                                                                       |
| 54:16      | If you've been listening to the show, you already understand most of it, honestly.                                |
| 54:21      | But you need to get your hands on it.                                                                             |
| 54:22      | So download, be be edit or one of these resources and spend some time doing it.                                   |
| 54:28      | If you're only going to use it occasionally, I would recommend building your own library                          |
| 54:33      | of regular expressions of things that you use frequently so you can always resource it.                           |
| 54:38      | But once you know that this tool exists, you are going to find yourself bumping into times                        |
| 54:42      | where you need to search through a lot of text and want to do this, or you're going                               |
| 54:47      | to be building a shortcut and realise, man, if I could just make it do this one extra                             |
| 54:51      | thing and that one extra thing involves words in any way, regular expressions is going to                         |
| 54:57      | help you solve the problem.                                                                                       |
| 54:58      | Yes, it definitely is.                                                                                            |
| 55:00      | All right.                                                                                                        |
| 55:01      | So let's talk about some additional resources.                                                                    |
| 55:02      | We've been talking about [[BBEdit]] off and on throughout the show, but go download it.                           |
| 55:06      | It's a free download.                                                                                             |
| 55:08      | Like I said, you get that trial at the beginning.                                                                 |
| 55:11      | Great company.                                                                                                    |
| 55:12      | They've been on the Mac for a long time.                                                                          |
| 55:16      | And they have the written materials for regular expressions.                                                      |
| 55:19      | They have the lab where you can open it up and just start typing them.                                            |
| 55:22      | I guess what they call it, *the pattern playground*, is what they call that, I believe.                             |
| 55:26      | And you can go in there and just figure out some stuff, play with it, drop some text in,                          |
| 55:32      | grab something off the internet, or you can even populate.                                                        |
| 55:35      | I think [[BBEdit]] has pre-populated text, if you want.                                                           |
| 55:38      | Yes, it does.                                                                                                     |
| 55:39      | It has a *Lorem Ipsum Generator*.                                                                                   |
| 55:41      | It also has a *Bacon Ipsum Generator* and it has a *Startup Ipsum Generator*.                                         |
| 55:46      | And yes, these are as intriguing and amazing as they sound, and I highly recommend playing                        |
| 55:51      | with them just for that alone.                                                                                    |
| 55:54      | "Bacon Ipsum", brilliant idea, making me hungry.                                                                    |
| 55:57      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 55:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                             |
| 55:59      | Well, I mean, it's almost dinner time here.                                                                       |
| 56:00      | So maybe afterwards.                                                                                              |
| 56:02      | But as well as [[BBEdit]], the [[BBEdit]] manual, even if you're not using [[BBEdit]], have a look                |
| 56:08      | at the chapter on regular expressions in there.                                                                   |
| 56:10      | If you're stuck and you're looking for a good resource, it is extremely thorough, which                           |
| 56:14      | is great.                                                                                                         |
| 56:16      | And there's also a resource that we'll put in the show notes for the shortcuts format                             |
| 56:20      | of regular expressions, because some programming languages and therefore some applications                        |
| 56:26      | use different formats of regular expressions.                                                                     |
| 56:29      | Now usually these don't vary a lot, but [[JavaScript]] has some slight oddities, perhaps you could                |
| 56:37      | call it, or uniqueness.                                                                                           |
| 56:39      | And so you'll want to make sure that you're using the right format, and [[Shortcuts]] uses                            |
| 56:43      | the [[ICU]] format for a lot of things, for date formatting, and for regular expressions.                             |
| 56:49      | So we'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.                                                            |
| 56:52      | Yeah, some other great resources.                                                                                 |
| 56:54      | There's an app for iOS called [[Pretty Regular Expressions]].                                                         |
| 56:57      | Good for testing regular expressions out.                                                                         |
| 57:00      | Yes, especially if you're on a plane.                                                                             |
| 57:02      | Yeah, and Rose found a good website, [Regex 101](https://regex101.com).                                                                   |
| 57:06      | Yes, and this works the same way [[BBEdit]] does pretty much.                                                     |
| 57:10      | It has a cheat sheet on the right hand side.                                                                      |
| 57:13      | It's got your search box at the top.                                                                              |
| 57:15      | It's got a big box where you can paste in some sample text.                                                       |
| 57:18      | And you can also try, there's an option to try the replaces as well.                                              |
| 57:22      | So it works like the pattern playgrounds in [[BBEdit]] in many ways, but it's a really                            |
| 57:27      | useful, and I often use all machines that don't have [[BBEdit]] installed.                                        |
| 57:31      | The next machine is primarily, and on my iPad, because it's extremely handy.                                      |
| 57:37      | You know, Rose, I've been threatening to talk about regular expressions on a podcast for                          |
| 57:40      | like 10 years.                                                                                                    |
| 57:42      | I'm glad to have helped you achieve your goal.                                                                    |
| 57:44      | You got me to do it, and I think it came out great.                                                               |
| 57:47      | Thanks so much for all your knowledge on this stuff.                                                              |
| 57:50      | If you are listening to us and you've never tried a regular expression, go get in front                           |
| 57:55      | of a computer, give it a try, try some of these resources out.                                                    |
| 57:58      | Like I said, this is just a great tool to have in your belt, and you'll find a use for                            |
| 58:01      | it if you understand it in the slightest.                                                                         |
| 58:04      | And don't worry, you don't need to become encyclopedic knowledge about regular expressions.                       |
| 58:09      | You just need to know generally what they do.                                                                     |
| 58:12      | And then when you have a problem with just a little bit of research, you'll find out.                             |
| 58:16      | And a great place to get help with that would be the automators forums.                                           |
| 58:20      | There's a lot of really smart friends there that would help you if you had trouble with                           |
| 58:24      | regular expression, I'm sure.                                                                                     |
| 58:26      | Yes.                                                                                                              |
| 58:27      | And don't forget, check the show notes for all the links, and it's also over at [relayfm.com](https://relayfm.com).                    |
| 58:34      | All right.                                                                                                        |

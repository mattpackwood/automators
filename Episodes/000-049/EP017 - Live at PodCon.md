| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | All right. Well, hello and welcome to Automators Live at PodCon.                                                   |
| 00:10      | I am here with a very enthusiastic audience.                                                                       |
| 00:14      | It's crazy. There's like 10,000 people here to watch us talk about automation.                                     |
| 00:18      | I had no idea that we would draw a crowd like this.                                                                |
| 00:21      | Yeah, it's kind of scary, right?                                                                                   |
| 00:22      | Yeah, this is awesome. Thank you, you all. Thank you.                                                              |
| 00:25      | Sir, sir in the front, sit down, please.                                                                           |
| 00:27      | Yes. So, yeah, we thought that a good topic for this mini show,                                                    |
| 00:33      | which is going to be wrapped into a longer show released in a couple of weeks,                                     |
| 00:37      | would be to talk about how we got here with automation, right?                                                     |
| 00:41      | Yeah. So, Rose and I are at the PodCon Convention Conference in Seattle, having a great time.                      |
| 00:46      | There's a lot of people here with horns and...                                                                     |
| 00:50      | Elf ears.                                                                                                          |
| 00:51      | Elf ears. It's kind of cool. It's our usual crowd. That's good.                                                    |
| 00:55      | And we're going to talk about automation. So, just to make it super nerdy, like Rose said,                         |
| 01:01      | we both had put together some simple automations we used to get here,                                              |
| 01:05      | and we thought we'd do kind of a speed round of talking through how we did that stuff.                             |
| 01:09      | Yeah. You want to go first?                                                                                        |
| 01:10      | All right. I'm going to go first with the one that I preach about everywhere,                                      |
| 01:14      | which is I use Tripit to automate my travel itineraries.                                                           |
| 01:17      | So, Tripit is this really cool service. It's free. You can pay for it as well.                                     |
| 01:21      | I am a Tripit pro user, but the stuff that I'm talking about right now                                             |
| 01:24      | can be done for free.                                                                                              |
| 01:25      | And essentially what you do, you book something, like a hotel, or a flight, or a train,                            |
| 01:30      | and then you send the email that you get. You just forward it to Tripit,                                           |
| 01:33      | and then they just magically read everything.                                                                      |
| 01:36      | They parse everything out, and they stick it all together.                                                         |
| 01:38      | And then they create this trip plan for you so that you can see, like, hey, okay.                                  |
| 01:41      | So, first, I'm flying from Vienna to Newark Airport, and then from Newark to Seattle,                              |
| 01:45      | and then I'm staying in this hotel in Seattle for one night,                                                       |
| 01:47      | and then I'm staying in this hotel for the other night,                                                            |
| 01:49      | then I'm flying back to Washington, D.C., and then from there, I'm flying home to Vienna.                          |
| 01:53      | And it just has all of that, and then you can just pray, make one PDF,                                             |
| 01:57      | and it's like, I know what I'm doing now. Yay! That's always good.                                                 |
| 02:02      | Yeah, you know, I have the homegrown Tripit thing.                                                                 |
| 02:04      | What I do recently, I've been trying to use Bear, which is another note-taking app.                                |
| 02:08      | I know. I like note-taking apps.                                                                                   |
| 02:11      | But this one is very automation-friendly, and it allows you to append information                                  |
| 02:16      | and files to a note. So whenever I take a trip, I create in Bear a new note.                                       |
| 02:22      | Like, I have one called 2019 PodCon.                                                                               |
| 02:25      | So, when I first do it, I'll write down the details,                                                               |
| 02:30      | maybe I'll write down the names of the people I'm going to be with,                                                |
| 02:32      | or whatever details I know about the conference.                                                                   |
| 02:36      | But then the emails start coming in, and we all get a bunch of email,                                              |
| 02:39      | whether it's from the airline or the hotel or whatever.                                                            |
| 02:41      | And I've got a simple thing what I do. It's a series shortcut extension.                                           |
| 02:49      | So the way it works is in [[Airmail]], which is the mail application I'm using,                                        |
| 02:53      | but you can do this in [[Apple Mail]] too.                                                                             |
| 02:54      | You can render an email as a PDF, and then you press the extension button.                                         |
| 03:00      | And it's just one action. In fact, let me just check here to make sure I got this right.                           |
| 03:04      | And what it does is it just saves the file to Bear,                                                                |
| 03:09      | but it allows you to specify when you create the series shortcut                                                   |
| 03:14      | which Bear file does it go to.                                                                                     |
| 03:17      | And so I have it save it directly to the Bear file that's related to the trip.                                     |
| 03:22      | So you could do this for any trip you take or any kind of event.                                                   |
| 03:24      | So as emails start coming in, you just press one button, it saves that email to it.                                |
| 03:30      | Now, this also works with a PDF.                                                                                   |
| 03:31      | So because it's an extension, it can attach itself to a PDF.                                                       |
| 03:35      | So it doesn't have to just be the text of an email, it could also be the attached PDFs.                            |
| 03:39      | And by just hitting that one button as these things come in,                                                       |
| 03:42      | then I've got one note that has all that stuff accumulated.                                                        |
| 03:45      | It doesn't do like Tripit does a better job of making it pretty                                                    |
| 03:48      | because Tripit really combines it nicely.                                                                          |
| 03:50      | But this is just a really simple way to put it all in one place.                                                   |
| 03:53      | And then you've got it all in that bear note.                                                                      |
| 03:55      | So the day you go to leave, you've got your airline, your hotel, all that stuff in one place.                      |
| 04:00      | Yeah. And one of the things I do, so I take that Tripit.                                                           |
| 04:05      | So Tripit has a calendar that you can subscribe to.                                                                |
| 04:07      | And I don't usually use Google Calendar, but for this, I use Google Calendar.                                      |
| 04:11      | And so I've subscribed to my Tripit calendar in Google Calendar.                                                   |
| 04:13      | And then I have Zapier watch it and whenever Zapier sees a new all day event                                       |
| 04:17      | added to the Tripit calendar, it then takes that and it creates one task in my OmniFocus inbox.                    |
| 04:24      | But this task is kind of special because it's actually got a OmniFocus URL in the notes field,                     |
| 04:30      | which when I tap on it creates an entire trip project for me based on the information from the Tripit trip.        |
| 04:38      | So that I know I have the name of the event and then they match up in OmniFocus and in Tripit.                     |
| 04:42      | So it's all the same. So I can just look at it and be like, OK, right.                                             |
| 04:46      | So it's 2019 slash 01 dash Seattle. That's the name of this trip.                                                  |
| 04:50      | And it's the same everywhere.                                                                                      |
| 04:51      | Nice. Nice.                                                                                                        |
| 04:53      | Let's talk about getting packed up and automation stuff we did.                                                    |
| 04:58      | You've got a very cool automation.                                                                                 |
| 04:59      | I want to give you the most time on this, but just real quick, the way I've done packing lists,                    |
| 05:04      | I don't even think it qualifies as automation, but Rose says I have to tell you about it.                          |
| 05:09      | If you go on reminders, I just have a list called packing list and I've added to it over the years.                |
| 05:14      | I've got so much stuff in there.                                                                                   |
| 05:16      | I was just looking and I've got an entry called fancy socks, you know,                                             |
| 05:19      | because sometimes I go to a wedding or something.                                                                  |
| 05:22      | If I don't bring my fancy socks, I'm going to look like an idiot.                                                  |
| 05:24      | So what I do is I have all these items in here and for every trip, I'll add new things.                            |
| 05:28      | Like in this trip, I brought some really nice stickers for Rose.                                                   |
| 05:32      | And if you were here with the 10,000 people, you'd be able to get one of her stickers.                             |
| 05:37      | But so I just added Rose stickers.                                                                                 |
| 05:39      | I've got this list and they're all checked off all the time, except when I prepare for a trip.                     |
| 05:42      | And then in reminders, you can say, show me the completed items.                                                   |
| 05:46      | And I'll just scroll through that list and click on the ones that I want to add to the packing list for this trip. |
| 05:51      | And because I've got such a kind of encompassing list, it's very easy to populate that.                            |
| 05:57      | The other advantage of reminders is you can share that with someone.                                               |
| 06:00      | So I share with my spouse when we're doing like a family trip and she can be checking items off as well.           |
| 06:04      | And reminders is the right speed for her.                                                                          |
| 06:07      | I know there's some really cool packing apps, but and I have some good ideas of the reminders,                     |
| 06:12      | but forget everything because Rose has turned this into a serious shortcut.                                        |
| 06:16      | Well, I did used to use an app called TripList, which syncs with Tripit, but it hasn't updated for the iPhone 10.  |
| 06:22      | And now I have an iPhone 10S Max, so it just looks horrific.                                                       |
| 06:24      | So I gave up on that and said, OK, I'm doing this in shortcuts.                                                    |
| 06:28      | And essentially what I do is I build a dictionary in shortcuts.                                                    |
| 06:32      | And so I have clothing and then list of different clothing that I might take.                                      |
| 06:37      | So like T-shirts, jumpers, socks, et cetera.                                                                       |
| 06:39      | You have fancy socks in your list?                                                                                 |
| 06:40      | I do not have fancy socks, but I'm sure everybody's dying to know what are non fancy socks like.                   |
| 06:45      | Do they have BB-8 on them?                                                                                         |
| 06:47      | Usually. OK, usually.                                                                                              |
| 06:48      | I mean, that's acceptable.                                                                                         |
| 06:50      | BB-8 socks are good.                                                                                               |
| 06:51      | The stance Star Wars.                                                                                              |
| 06:52      | I won't lie when I say the stance Star Wars socks have a lot of real estate in my sock drawer.                     |
| 06:59      | That's OK.                                                                                                         |
| 07:00      | Well, I may need to add fancy socks to my packing list.                                                            |
| 07:03      | But essentially what I do is I build this dictionary.                                                              |
| 07:05      | So the keys are the different kinds of things that I pack, like clothing, technology, random stuff                 |
| 07:11      | that apparently I need on the plane, like Nintendo Switch, because why not?                                        |
| 07:15      | And things like that.                                                                                              |
| 07:16      | And then I go through and I have it give me the list of the keys.                                                  |
| 07:22      | So it's like, OK, do you need to pack clothing?                                                                    |
| 07:24      | You would think that's obvious.                                                                                    |
| 07:25      | But for some trips, you don't need clothing because you're just going for like one night                           |
| 07:28      | and it's just like, OK, I just need some clean underwear and we're good.                                           |
| 07:31      | And then so I select the different things and it goes through and it builds a nicely                               |
| 07:37      | layered series of action groups, which are Taskpaper, which I then add to OmniFocus.                              |
| 07:44      | Because I do everything in OmniFocus, including my packing lists.                                                  |
| 07:46      | And what I do is I add a specific tag to everything.                                                               |
| 07:50      | And this tag is called the packing tag.                                                                            |
| 07:51      | And most of the time this tag is on hold because, for example, the trip to WWDC,                                   |
| 07:56      | that's going to happen in June this year, I do not need to see the fact that I need                                |
| 08:00      | to pack five pairs of socks.                                                                                       |
| 08:02      | Like right now that is not important in my day to day life.                                                        |
| 08:05      | So that tag is always on hold.                                                                                     |
| 08:06      | And then like a couple of days before the trip, then I'll just take that tag off hold                              |
| 08:10      | and I'll see all of my packing items for everything.                                                               |
| 08:12      | And what I like about this is it means that I can have like a section called podcasting                            |
| 08:16      | gear.                                                                                                              |
| 08:17      | And if I'm going to visit my boyfriend's sisters, I do not need to pack podcasting                                 |
| 08:20      | gear.                                                                                                              |
| 08:21      | I mean, I could, but they're probably going to look at me like I've grown four heads                               |
| 08:23      | instead of the season two, so I'm sticking with no podcasting gear for that trip.                                  |
| 08:28      | And that's what I do with that.                                                                                    |
| 08:29      | And I will share a link to this one in the show notes and probably do a little video                               |
| 08:34      | on it as well, because it looks kind of crazy when you look at it, but it's actually nice                          |
| 08:38      | and easy to edit and to make more, more sections of it.                                                            |
| 08:42      | Yeah, I was looking at this and what I really liked the way Rose did it, she made up modular,                      |
| 08:46      | uses a dictionary entry.                                                                                           |
| 08:47      | So if you've got not podcasting equipment, but maybe, you know, you like to go fly your                            |
| 08:53      | drone or do something else, you could make a segment for that as well.                                             |
| 08:59      | We've got some other topics though we wanted to talk about.                                                        |
| 09:02      | One of them that I think of whenever I go to like a conference, you know, is you get                               |
| 09:08      | a lot of paper, people throw paper at you everywhere you go.                                                       |
| 09:11      | We were walking around the show floor here, everybody has their paper they want to give                            |
| 09:15      | us and then Rose got the cool swag bag, you know, it's full of stuff.                                              |
| 09:20      | I don't like any of that stuff, you know, I don't want that paper.                                                 |
| 09:24      | So I made a scanner pro automation for this scanner pro is a great app.                                            |
| 09:29      | We haven't talked about it on the show yet, but it's an app that allows you to take a                              |
| 09:33      | picture of anything turning into a PDF, but they're very automation friendly.                                      |
| 09:37      | This one doesn't require a serious shortcut, you can do it right in the application.                               |
| 09:41      | And they have automations in the app.                                                                              |
| 09:44      | They are called.                                                                                                   |
| 09:45      | I should have it over.                                                                                             |
| 09:46      | I think they're called workflows.                                                                                  |
| 09:47      | Yeah, workflows, of course.                                                                                        |
| 09:49      | Audience nods.                                                                                                     |
| 09:50      | Yes, workflows.                                                                                                    |
| 09:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 09:52      | So I've made a simple workflow that allows me to take a document that it has image.                                |
| 09:57      | So it's always scanner pro, it's you just find a piece of paper and it turns it into                               |
| 10:00      | a PDF.                                                                                                             |
| 10:01      | It does a really good job.                                                                                         |
| 10:02      | It gets the contrast right.                                                                                        |
| 10:04      | It finds the edges.                                                                                                |
| 10:07      | And then you run a workflow and the workflow I do renames the file.                                                |
| 10:13      | That's the sexy part, Rose, the rename.                                                                            |
| 10:16      | So what's the formatting on the naming?                                                                            |
| 10:19      | So I just put podcon and then a hyphen and then the date and then a hyphen and then the                            |
| 10:23      | time.                                                                                                              |
| 10:24      | And the reason I do that is I just want to get enough distinction that as I take pictures                          |
| 10:29      | of different things walking around here, they'll be the distinct files.                                            |
| 10:34      | And then I save it to a folder that I created on Dropbox.                                                          |
| 10:38      | So as I walk through the conference or like if you do speaking, they give you these bags                           |
| 10:44      | full of stuff.                                                                                                     |
| 10:45      | You can just take pictures of things.                                                                              |
| 10:46      | Like if you see somebody at a conference, you take a picture of their business card.                               |
| 10:49      | If you see a vendor you want, you take a picture of their poster.                                                  |
| 10:53      | And at the end of the day, you've got this collection of PDFs that have saved to your                              |
| 10:57      | Dropbox and you don't have to take any paper home.                                                                 |
| 11:01      | And then I guess what I should do is I should add a create task in OmniFocus or whatever                           |
| 11:07      | your task manager of choice is to review that stuff in a week when you get home.                                   |
| 11:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 11:11      | Because I mean, in the moment of travel, everything's like, oh my gosh, it's so pretty.                            |
| 11:15      | I need this map.                                                                                                   |
| 11:16      | I need this other map.                                                                                             |
| 11:17      | I've got 5,000 maps of Disneyland Paris now.                                                                       |
| 11:19      | I'm not even kidding.                                                                                              |
| 11:20      | And it's like, what am I going to do with all of this?                                                             |
| 11:22      | So yes, that's a very good point.                                                                                  |
| 11:24      | You want to have a point to review that.                                                                           |
| 11:27      | And that's one of the reasons why I like creating templates, which was one of our early episodes                   |
| 11:32      | we created.                                                                                                        |
| 11:33      | We talked about creating project templates and that's something I do for all of my                                 |
| 11:35      | trips every trip has a project template.                                                                           |
| 11:40      | Another automation I have is I use Airmail.                                                                        |
| 11:43      | We're both using Airmail right now as my mail app of choice.                                                       |
| 11:46      | And it has these things that are called custom actions.                                                            |
| 11:49      | And I have a trip action in there, which is just for travel.                                                       |
| 11:54      | And so what it does is it marks the emails read.                                                                   |
| 11:58      | So if, for example, I've got five or six emails related to the trip that are all coming                            |
| 12:01      | together, I can just handle them all together.                                                                     |
| 12:04      | It tags it with my travel tag, archives it, and forwards it to Tripit.                                             |
| 12:09      | So then Tripit will then go suck it all in and parse it and turn it into something pretty.                         |
| 12:15      | And of course, there is a filter in the backend to get rid of all the Tripit emails going,                         |
| 12:18      | yes, thank you very much.                                                                                          |
| 12:19      | We've received this email from you.                                                                                |
| 12:21      | Like as long as it worked, I don't care.                                                                           |
| 12:23      | So I just have that automatically filtered away.                                                                   |
| 12:25      | How do you deal with email when you're on a trip?                                                                  |
| 12:28      | Do you have any automation to help avoid the flood?                                                                |
| 12:32      | It's not precisely an automation in settings.                                                                      |
| 12:35      | You can turn off notifications.                                                                                    |
| 12:37      | So I just do that.                                                                                                 |
| 12:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 12:39      | It depends for me if it's a long trip, I will make an auto responder.                                              |
| 12:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 12:44      | Also, if you use something like a sandbox, the occasional sponsor over in Mac Power users,                         |
| 12:48      | they have a vacation mode where it'll save emails just into a vacation folder and you                              |
| 12:52      | can deal with it and you get back.                                                                                 |
| 12:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 12:54      | That's great for something like a work email address for work.                                                     |
| 12:56      | Of course, I have an auto responder enabled.                                                                       |
| 12:58      | My phone is forwarded.                                                                                             |
| 13:02      | That's the word.                                                                                                   |
| 13:03      | I was thinking of the German word for a moment because that's what my task manager tells me.                       |
| 13:07      | And yeah, I actually have two projects for every trip.                                                             |
| 13:10      | I have a work one which goes into the work section and then my regular one.                                        |
| 13:14      | So I know, for example, coming here, there were approximately six travel disasters on                              |
| 13:20      | the way and I ended up arriving a day early after all of that, which is impressive, but                            |
| 13:24      | it was good because I looked at it and it's like, okay, I am on my way to the airport much                         |
| 13:28      | earlier than I anticipated, what stuff did I not do before I left work on Friday that                              |
| 13:33      | has to be done and got it all done in the airport.                                                                 |
| 13:35      | Is that like a British thing?                                                                                      |
| 13:36      | Like Dr. Who, you have a problem?                                                                                  |
| 13:38      | You get there day early?                                                                                           |
| 13:40      | In my case, it was just a case of I turned up at the airline desk and said, help me please.                        |
| 13:45      | And they said, okay.                                                                                               |
| 13:47      | So yeah, I got put on an early flight.                                                                             |
| 13:52      | So yeah, I do think that finding a way to deal with email and your time when you're traveling                      |
| 13:58      | is important.                                                                                                      |
| 13:59      | We talked about time blocking and automation for time stuff.                                                       |
| 14:02      | I find that one of my little series short shortcuts is what I call travel work and it's                            |
| 14:08      | just a simple series shortcut that creates a series of events.                                                     |
| 14:12      | And unfortunately, I just don't have the kind of life where I can just like completely unplug                      |
| 14:16      | for a week at a time.                                                                                              |
| 14:17      | So before I leave on a trip, I just run this shortcut and it creates some events for me                            |
| 14:22      | in my calendar to deal with email and some of the day-to-day business of my various enterprises.                   |
| 14:29      | And usually they're early morning events that could create an automatically and it kind                            |
| 14:33      | of makes me hold myself honest.                                                                                    |
| 14:35      | So like when I'm on a trip and I'm drinking and it's getting late, I have something to                             |
| 14:40      | remind me that, okay, don't go too crazy here, man.                                                                |
| 14:43      | You got to get up and work tomorrow morning.                                                                       |
| 14:45      | So that's a very simple automation.                                                                                |
| 14:46      | You just create an event and then I run that usually on the plane on the way to a trip.                            |
| 14:51      | Yeah, I mean, I do something kind of similar.                                                                      |
| 14:54      | I usually create a task, a tag, sorry, an OmniFocus.                                                              |
| 15:00      | And this is especially useful for work things.                                                                     |
| 15:02      | And I create a tag that's called after XYZ trip.                                                                   |
| 15:06      | So in the run up to the trip, I'm looking at everything and people are going, Rose, can                            |
| 15:09      | you do this?                                                                                                       |
| 15:10      | Rose, I need you to do this for me.                                                                                |
| 15:11      | And I'm like, okay, after the trip.                                                                                |
| 15:13      | And then this tag is on hold and then when I come back from the trip, I just delete that                           |
| 15:17      | tag.                                                                                                               |
| 15:18      | What I used to do is defer everything until after the trip.                                                        |
| 15:20      | There is nothing worse than coming back to work after a trip and looking at your task                              |
| 15:24      | manager and going, oh, that's a lot of stuff.                                                                      |
| 15:28      | Like, you know, you want to ease yourself back into it.                                                            |
| 15:30      | So all I do is I have to just delete the tag and then stuff reappears where it's supposed                          |
| 15:34      | to be.                                                                                                             |
| 15:35      | You know, it's, Rose, it's really fun podcasting with you sitting next to you.                                     |
| 15:39      | It's slightly weird, but I like it.                                                                                |
| 15:40      | I guess we can talk, we don't talk over each other as much and we're in front of this great                        |
| 15:44      | live audience.                                                                                                     |
| 15:45      | There's a bunch of great nerds out there.                                                                          |
| 15:46      | Say hi, everybody.                                                                                                 |
| 15:48      | Yeah, see, that's, that's, that sounds like 10,000 to me, I think.                                                 |
| 15:51      | Definitely.                                                                                                        |
| 15:52      | Definitely.                                                                                                        |
| 15:53      | Occasionally, somebody walks by in full costume and they look at us and they listen to like                        |
| 15:56      | five seconds of what we say and they're like, what, wasn't this supposed to be like funny                          |
| 16:00      | shows?                                                                                                             |
| 16:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 16:02      | What's going on here?                                                                                              |
| 16:03      | Well, I mean, somebody just laughed.                                                                               |
| 16:04      | So there we go.                                                                                                    |
| 16:05      | We're good.                                                                                                        |
| 16:06      | It was an uncomfortable laughed.                                                                                   |
| 16:08      | So I'll take it though.                                                                                            |
| 16:09      | What are some of your other favourite travel automations?                                                           |
| 16:13      | Oh, um, yes.                                                                                                       |
| 16:16      | We don't have time for a lot of them.                                                                              |
| 16:18      | Let me see.                                                                                                        |
| 16:19      | I'm just going to have a quick look in shortcuts and see which ones I could go through super                       |
| 16:24      | quickly.                                                                                                           |
| 16:25      | Let me see.                                                                                                        |
| 16:26      | I'll tell you, one of my favourite automations is making sure that my noise canceling headphones                    |
| 16:31      | are on my packing list.                                                                                            |
| 16:32      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 16:33      | You've got to have them.                                                                                           |
| 16:35      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 16:36      | I actually have one, which is adding my travel to the airport.                                                     |
| 16:39      | So the way I get to the airport, I take a tram and a train.                                                        |
| 16:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 16:42      | Okay.                                                                                                              |
| 16:43      | And the tram always lasts for X minutes and the train always lasts for X minutes.                                  |
| 16:45      | Um, and so I actually have a shortcut that just asked me, okay, what time does the tram                            |
| 16:50      | leave?                                                                                                             |
| 16:51      | What time does the train leave?                                                                                    |
| 16:52      | And it sticks it in my travel calendar.                                                                            |
| 16:53      | Um, which yeah, because I always look it up, but adding everything with the addresses                              |
| 16:57      | and stuff so that it appears at the right thing.                                                                   |
| 16:59      | And so that you know that you get the reminder to leave so that you actually get the tram                          |
| 17:04      | instead of standing there going, well, that was the tram.                                                          |
| 17:07      | Cool.                                                                                                              |
| 17:08      | How do I get to the airport?                                                                                       |
| 17:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 17:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 17:11      | Another one I use is another series shortcut all the time is a lot of times I go on trips                          |
| 17:14      | and, uh, without my family, it's work related.                                                                     |
| 17:17      | And, um, I like to just kind of keep my wife posted as to where I'm at and what's going                            |
| 17:22      | on.                                                                                                                |
| 17:23      | And I have a real simple series shortcut called here I am and all it's two steps.                                  |
| 17:27      | It goes into [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]], it grabs my current location and it creates a text message                          |
| 17:33      | because I only have one wife that makes it really easy.                                                            |
| 17:36      | I, I create the text message and it's already addressed to her and it says here I am and                           |
| 17:41      | it just drops my current address in.                                                                               |
| 17:44      | It's like when I get back to the hotel, I'll send it to her and it's just one button.                              |
| 17:48      | Um, I could even automate that now that I think about if I want to automate firing                                 |
| 17:52      | that off.                                                                                                          |
| 17:53      | But it's just a nice way to kind of let her know how I'm doing and then like usually                               |
| 17:57      | when I get back to the room is when I can get on the phone together and then she doesn't                           |
| 18:00      | call me until she gets that text message.                                                                          |
| 18:03      | Um, it's, it's, it's an example of something anybody can do.                                                       |
| 18:07      | Everybody that's got an iOS device can load up [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]], two steps, find location                          |
| 18:12      | and the next one is send a text message and you're in another one, which I use is in find                          |
| 18:17      | friends, uh, which is built into iOS, um, is, uh, the ability to either notify somebody                            |
| 18:24      | when you get to a location or if you are stalking somebody like this weekend, I'm stalking David,                  |
| 18:30      | you can have it notify you when they get to a location.                                                            |
| 18:33      | So David yesterday was on his way to the hotel from the airport and I just had it notify                           |
| 18:37      | me when he was like a block away and I got a notification was able to go down to the lobby                         |
| 18:41      | and look like I've been sitting there for hours waiting for him when actually I just                               |
| 18:45      | got there like 30 seconds earlier.                                                                                 |
| 18:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 18:48      | I think the find friends is a great thing on trips, you know, like family or friends.                              |
| 18:52      | The first thing Rose and I did was we find friends for the duration of this trip and                               |
| 18:55      | it makes it really easy to find each other.                                                                        |
| 18:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 18:58      | Well, listen, we don't have much time left before, you know, the 10,000 people cycle                               |
| 19:01      | out of here.                                                                                                       |
| 19:02      | Well, I actually had to say it's more like 12,000 now.                                                             |
| 19:04      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                                  |
| 19:05      | I feel really bad for the next podcast because I mean, how are they going to crowd like this?                      |
| 19:11      | Well, we're the automators.                                                                                        |

| 19:19      | I want to do one on my favourite luggage, the shampoo I use.                                                        |
| 19:23      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 19:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 19:25      | And Rose is going to do a screencast on that really cool OmniFocus script.                                         |
| 19:29      | So we'll see that one too.                                                                                         |
| 19:31      | Yep.                                                                                                               |
| 19:32      | Thanks everybody for hanging out with us today and we'll see you next time.                                        |
| 19:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 19:37      | Thank you very much and goodbye.                                                                                   |
| 19:38      | This episode of The Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN, high speed, secure and                             |
| 19:49      | anonymous VPN service, get three months free with a one year package.                                              |
| 19:54      | We've seen a lot in the media lately about online security breaches.                                               |
| 19:57      | So it's only natural to worry about where your data goes, especially when something                                |
| 20:01      | as simple as sending an email can put your private information at risk.                                            |
| 20:05      | This is how you're being tracked by social media sites, marketing companies and possibly                           |
| 20:10      | even your internet provider.                                                                                       |
| 20:12      | And not only can they record your browsing history, they can also sell it to people who                            |
| 20:17      | want to profit from your information.                                                                              |
| 20:19      | You can take back your privacy with ExpressVPN.                                                                    |
| 20:22      | ExpressVPN works by securing and anonymising your internet browsing.                                               |
| 20:27      | It encrypts your data and hides your public IP address.                                                            |
| 20:30      | You can turn on ExpressVPN protection with just one click.                                                         |
| 20:34      | The easy to use apps run seamlessly in the background of your computer, iPhone and iPad                            |
| 20:39      | and it costs less than $7 a month.                                                                                 |
| 20:42      | ExpressVPN is rated the number one VPN service by Tech Rider.                                                      |
| 20:47      | It even comes with a 30 day money back guarantee.                                                                  |
| 20:50      | So if you've ever used public Wi-Fi and want to keep the bad guys away from your data,                             |
| 20:56      | you need ExpressVPN.                                                                                               |
| 20:57      | You know, as we get back from this trip that we just took, Seattle has a lot of really                             |
| 21:01      | great Wi-Fi was something I was impressed with that city kind of makes sense because                               |
| 21:06      | there's so much technology up there.                                                                               |
| 21:08      | But I still never feel comfortable getting on the Wi-Fi in a public place because it                               |
| 21:12      | really does open you up to exposure to hackers.                                                                    |
| 21:16      | And Seattle is also full of really smart computer people.                                                          |
| 21:19      | So maybe I don't want to do that.                                                                                  |
| 21:21      | Well I used ExpressVPN all throughout the trip.                                                                    |
| 21:24      | Anytime I wanted to go on Wi-Fi, I would just push the button ExpressVPN on my phone                               |
| 21:29      | on my iPad or my Mac and it just took care of it for me.                                                           |
| 21:32      | It's really great having one of these services installed on your devices.                                          |
| 21:36      | So anytime you want to protect yourself, you can.                                                                  |
| 21:41      | So I use it all the time and I think it's a great idea.                                                            |
| 21:44      | Honestly, in 2019, I think just about everybody should have a VPN service.                                         |
| 21:49      | So protect your online activity today by going to expressvpn.com/automators.                                 |

| 22:00      | ExpressVPN is the answer.                                                                                          |

| 22:20      | Well, welcome back from Seattle, David, we're not a pock on anymore.                                               |
| 22:25      | It was sure nice spending some time with you up there though.                                                      |
| 22:27      | We had a great time.                                                                                               |
| 22:28      | Yes, it was amazing and we got to meet so many listeners as well.                                                  |
| 22:32      | Thank you to everybody who came to that meetup.                                                                    |
| 22:34      | Yeah, the meet up just to give a quick summary was amazing.                                                         |
| 22:39      | We had a bar booked for it, but so many people signed up that we were way beyond what we                           |
| 22:44      | told the bar we were bringing and we were a little worried about it.                                               |
| 22:47      | Like triple capacity.                                                                                              |
| 22:48      | Yeah, we were a little worried about it and you and I had the opportunity to go and check                          |
| 22:52      | out the Omni Group's kind of corporate headquarters.                                                               |
| 22:57      | And we were telling them about it and they said, no problem, you can have it here.                                 |
| 23:00      | They have a really great cafeteria area there at the Omni Group.                                                   |
| 23:05      | And so we changed the location and a lot of people showed up.                                                      |
| 23:11      | We had a musical guest, I mean.                                                                                    |
| 23:14      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 23:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 23:16      | It got a little bit crazy and I think we accidentally set the bar insanely high.                                   |
| 23:21      | So if you were at the meeting before, then please don't expect that much awesomeness                               |
| 23:26      | again apart from, of course, David, because Sparky is awesome, but yeah, it was great                              |
| 23:32      | fun to meet everybody and to hear about all the different things that everybody's been                             |
| 23:35      | automating as well, which is very inspiring.                                                                       |
| 23:38      | And I got to introduce Rose to the American tradition of going to Target and loading up                            |
| 23:43      | a cart for a party, which was great too.                                                                           |
| 23:46      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 23:47      | I've literally never done anything like that before in my life.                                                    |
| 23:49      | So yeah, cart was surprisingly maneuverable.                                                                       |
| 23:53      | So well done Target.                                                                                               |
| 23:54      | There we go.                                                                                                       |
| 23:55      | There we go.                                                                                                       |
| 23:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 23:57      | Well, you know, we've already recorded half of this episode.                                                       |
| 23:59      | So the first half of this episode, as you heard, was recorded live at PodCon.                                      |
| 24:03      | And now we're home.                                                                                                |
| 24:04      | We thought it would be good to just fill up the rest of the episode with some of that                              |
| 24:07      | feedback that everybody's been sending us.                                                                         |
| 24:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 24:10      | It's been a while since we did feedback on the show and there's quite a bit.                                       |
| 24:13      | Well, it's been 10 episodes since we lasted some feedback.                                                         |
| 24:16      | And that was episode 7 when we talked about the fact that the podcast was indeed a success.                        |
| 24:21      | So I thought we'd let you know that the podcast is still a success and what other things                           |
| 24:25      | you've told us.                                                                                                    |
| 24:26      | Hooray.                                                                                                            |
| 24:27      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 24:28      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 24:29      | The first thing I would say is you really need, if you haven't, you need to really head                            |
| 24:34      | over to talk.automators.fm.                                                                                        |
| 24:37      | It's a great community of folks.                                                                                   |
| 24:39      | Yeah, everybody there is just extremely nice, very welcoming.                                                      |
| 24:45      | If you post a question, you've got no idea where to start.                                                         |
| 24:47      | You don't need to be worried just because, A, everybody's really, really nice anyway,                              |
| 24:52      | because that's the kind of listeners that we have, lovely people.                                                  |
| 24:55      | And B, we're here to learn.                                                                                        |
| 24:58      | Nobody's going to judge you or think, oh my gosh, this person's so silly.                                          |
| 25:01      | They didn't think to use shortcuts for this.                                                                       |
| 25:02      | That's not the case.                                                                                               |
| 25:04      | You can post something where you've got absolutely no idea and everybody will try and point you                    |
| 25:08      | in the right direction.                                                                                            |
| 25:09      | If you're lucky, then some people might even just do the automation for you and say, here's                        |
| 25:13      | what it looks like when it's finished so you can implement it yourself, which is lovely.                           |
| 25:18      | And if you've made automations, you're very welcome to share them as well.                                         |
| 25:21      | We would absolutely love to see more finished automations just being shared.                                       |
| 25:25      | Well, we teased on the show, I believe it was on the episode where we talked about Launch                          |
| 25:30      | Centre Pro, iBeacons and how we, at some point, we're going to do a show on it.                                    |
| 25:35      | I've got some, Rose's got some, and we've been both in plane with them.                                            |
| 25:39      | But of course, the listeners were not ready to wait for that.                                                      |
| 25:43      | So there's a whole thread on this over at the forum.                                                               |
| 25:48      | Sylumer found USB iBeacons, which looked pretty nice.                                                            |
| 25:52      | Apparently, the ones we talked about on the show are no longer available on Amazon.                                |
| 25:56      | No.                                                                                                                |
| 25:57      | So we're post using some by Estimote, and it looks like you can still buy individual ones                            |
| 26:02      | on Amazon, but the packs of three or four may not be available, at least they're not                               |
| 26:08      | on amazon.com at the time of recording.                                                                            |
| 26:11      | If CamelCamelCamel is working, then you can use the website camelcamelcamel.com to track                           |
| 26:18      | an Amazon listing and find out when it becomes available again or when it goes on sale.                            |
| 26:25      | So you may want to try that there as we record.                                                                    |
| 26:28      | They are unfortunately having some server issues, but they should hopefully be back                                |
| 26:32      | quite soon.                                                                                                        |
| 26:33      | And honestly, it's kind of hacky to buy these things and set them up right now.                                    |
| 26:38      | Yeah, it is.                                                                                                       |
| 26:39      | And like when we do the show out, we're going to have to go through that in detail how you                         |
| 26:42      | do it.                                                                                                             |
| 26:43      | But one of the things I was hoping is by the time we get around to doing that show that                            |
| 26:47      | there'll be somebody with a product out there that's a little more consumer friendly.                              |
| 26:50      | Well, we are keeping an eye out for that as well, because of course, everybody wants                               |
| 26:55      | to have good iBeacons and we're very much hoping that somebody out there, a fellow nerd                            |
| 27:00      | is going to get on with it and create some of these.                                                               |
| 27:03      | And as soon as we've got something like that, we will let you know.                                                |
| 27:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 27:07      | Okay, other feedback, [[Scriptable]].                                                                                  |
| 27:10      | Scriptable with [[Simon St√∏vring]] was one of our episodes, and I'm very much hoping I pronounce                      |
| 27:15      | Simon's surname correctly there.                                                                                   |
| 27:16      | I can see how I let you do that.                                                                                   |
| 27:19      | Yeah, yeah, that's very sneaky, and I approve.                                                                     |
| 27:22      | That's fine.                                                                                                       |
| 27:23      | Yeah, [[Simon St√∏vring\|| 27:23      | Yeah, Simon, who is lovely, and the Scriptable forums are in the Automated forums, actually,                       |]]Simon, who is lovely, and the Scriptable forums are in the Automated forums, actually,                       |
| 27:29      | and somebody wrote a Scriptable script to identify car registration plates.                                        |
| 27:34      | I think we've reached peak automation right there.                                                                 |
| 27:37      | You can just take a photo of a car registration plate, and Scriptable will identify it.                            |
| 27:41      | That's so crazy.                                                                                                   |
| 27:42      | I know, it's insane.                                                                                               |
| 27:44      | But if you're looking for examples of things that you can do Scriptable, there are a lot                           |
| 27:48      | of other less crazy ones in the forums, which people have shared.                                                  |
| 27:52      | Using this one, I'll make sure a link to this one is in the show notes so that everybody                           |
| 27:55      | can find it and try and identify it.                                                                               |
| 27:57      | The one thing I didn't check is whether or not it identifies just US plates or also European                       |
| 28:04      | plates as well.                                                                                                    |
| 28:05      | Well, now you have a homework project.                                                                             |
| 28:06      | Of course, we have a different format.                                                                             |
| 28:07      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                 |
| 28:08      | I mean, I don't drive, so I need to go start taking photos of cars on the street and hope                          |
| 28:12      | that people don't get upstairs.                                                                                    |
| 28:13      | I don't know.                                                                                                      |
| 28:14      | We'll see.                                                                                                         |
| 28:15      | I hope it's telling me you're part of the security state.                                                          |
| 28:18      | It's all right.                                                                                                    |
| 28:19      | Yeah, I'll just wear black heads of toe and try and look slightly terrifying.                                      |
| 28:23      | I mean, I don't really know what security look like over here.                                                     |
| 28:26      | I don't really see them that often.                                                                                |
| 28:27      | I feel like if there was a Jane bond that you could probably pull it off.                                          |
| 28:33      | Well, challenge accepted.                                                                                          |
| 28:37      | If I ever get access, I think I travel too much for that kind of security clearance.                               |
| 28:42      | You definitely have the gizmos for it, right?                                                                      |
| 28:44      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 28:45      | I've got all of the gadgets.                                                                                       |
| 28:47      | Exactly.                                                                                                           |
| 28:48      | I think I just, you could script them better than James Bond ever could.                                           |
| 28:52      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 28:53      | Well, I mean, I will give it a try.                                                                                |
| 28:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 28:56      | That's for sure.                                                                                                   |
| 28:57      | Now you just need to figure out how to kill a man with like a light bulb or something,                             |
| 29:00      | but you know.                                                                                                      |
| 29:01      | Well, I mean, I have a mirror, which is also a battery pack, which also has a ring inside                          |
| 29:06      | of it that lights up so that you can check your makeup properly, slash use it as a portable                        |
| 29:09      | light in the hotel room where the lamp is not positioned where you would like it to                                |
| 29:15      | be.                                                                                                                |
| 29:16      | Wait a second.                                                                                                     |
| 29:17      | You have a mirror that's a USB battery?                                                                            |
| 29:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 29:21      | And it's got a light.                                                                                              |
| 29:22      | I'll put a link to it in the show notes just because everybody's going to ask for me for                           |
| 29:26      | that.                                                                                                              |
| 29:27      | So I'm literally looking it up right now.                                                                          |
| 29:29      | Oh man.                                                                                                            |
| 29:30      | I think that's something my wife would really like.                                                                |
| 29:33      | It's something that a lot of women quite like because it's quite large for a mirror.                               |
| 29:39      | And it's round and flat, but it's very useful because it literally can do three things.                            |
| 29:47      | And when I used to work, so along with, it seems quite a few people on the relay network,                          |
| 29:52      | I used to work for Disney and the apartments that they give you, Disney and Paris are pretty                       |
| 29:57      | good, but the one thing that they do not have is a bedside lamp, which means that when you                         |
| 30:01      | go to turn off the lights at night, so you turn off the lights and then suddenly you're                            |
| 30:05      | by the front door in the dark.                                                                                     |
| 30:07      | So I got this so that I could take it with me so that I could leave it like on the nightstand.                     |
| 30:13      | And then I would still be able to see and go back to bed and then you can just turn                                |
| 30:16      | it off.                                                                                                            |
| 30:17      | Nice.                                                                                                              |
| 30:18      | Nice.                                                                                                              |
| 30:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 30:20      | So on filing, we talked about that on the show last time.                                                          |
| 30:27      | And there was a good question in the forum about how do you decide what tools you use                              |
| 30:32      | for this stuff and quick ATB, I don't know if it's Qui Cat B, I don't know how he or                               |
| 30:42      | she pronounces it.                                                                                                 |
| 30:43      | But the question was, how do you choose between Automator, [[Alfred]], Keyboard, Maestro, Apple                        |
| 30:47      | Script, [[Hazel]], I can think of a few more to perform actions.                                                       |
| 30:53      | And I think it really depends on what you're doing.                                                                |
| 30:58      | Just a quick rundown, tools like Spotlight, Automator, I'm sorry Spotlight, [[Alfred]], Launch                         |
| 31:05      | Bar, those are tools that are allowing you to use your keyboard to do things on your                               |
| 31:09      | Mac quickly.                                                                                                       |
| 31:10      | But they aren't really automation tools that much, although with [[Alfred]] and Launch Bar,                            |
| 31:15      | there certainly are automation elements to them.                                                                   |
| 31:17      | Definitely, yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 31:19      | I think that [[AppleScript]] is like a whole other level, it's something you need to learn                            |
| 31:24      | and it's probably the most powerful tool on the Mac if you need to do stuff because it                             |
| 31:29      | can talk to applications.                                                                                          |
| 31:32      | Automator is like a level below [[AppleScript]] where it kind of does everything for you.                             |
| 31:36      | That was the original idea of kind of build your own automation without coding.                                    |
| 31:42      | And then Keyboard Maestro, to me, is probably the starting point for most people that want                         |
| 31:48      | to seriously take this stuff on because it does so many things.                                                    |
| 31:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 31:54      | I mean, personally, I would say if it's a difficult automation, then use whatever you're                           |
| 32:00      | most familiar with, where if it's easy, then maybe that's a good opportunity to look at                            |
| 32:04      | a tool that you would like to use that doesn't get enough use, something like that, just                           |
| 32:09      | to help you balance out your automation skillset.                                                                  |
| 32:12      | But of course, you have to pick a tool that's capable of doing the job.                                            |
| 32:15      | So the example in this particular case was to create 12 folders, one for each month of                             |
| 32:20      | the year and the name should be the month name, always a two-digit one dash and then                               |
| 32:25      | the name of the month.                                                                                             |
| 32:27      | And so there's a lot of ways that you can do that and you can, of course, just do it                               |
| 32:32      | by hand if you're really stuck, but you probably don't want to do that by hand every year.                         |
| 32:37      | So yes, there's a lot of options out there for all of these solutions naturally.                                   |
| 32:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 32:42      | On that specific question, as it relates to a filing episode, I don't know if the listener                         |
| 32:46      | was trying to make folders like to file invoice in a way, but [[Hazel]] is really good for the                         |
| 32:54      | filing piece of that because you can even tell [[Hazel]] look in that folder and sort it                               |
| 33:00      | into a subfolder by month.                                                                                         |
| 33:02      | And if there isn't a subfolder for that month, create one when you do it.                                          |
| 33:06      | So that's the ultimate automation where you don't even have to push the button to make                             |
| 33:11      | it happen.                                                                                                         |
| 33:12      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 33:13      | I mean, in this case, I think it might have been that he needed the months in advance so                           |
| 33:16      | that he could pre-file certain things because every so often, for example, occasionally                            |
| 33:20      | I'll get my text return in May and they come here in June, the amount that I'm getting                             |
| 33:26      | back, I get told about it in June.                                                                                 |
| 33:28      | And so I like to post date that and stick that into the right folder.                                                |
| 33:32      | So every so often, you don't have the right folder already and then you need it and that's                         |
| 33:36      | a little bit of a hassle.                                                                                          |
| 33:37      | So perhaps to avoid that or something similar, but yes, especially filing, you can use all                         |
| 33:43      | of the tools pretty much.                                                                                          |
| 33:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 33:46      | And it's kind of like you're talking like a 43 folder situation where you're putting                               |
| 33:50      | things into the future and then in that case, you do need to create those folders.                                 |
| 33:54      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 33:55      | I was going to give someone general advice about on their Mac getting automation going.                            |
| 34:01      | I think I would say [[Hazel]] and Keyboard Maestro are probably the two best apps that anybody                         |
| 34:08      | can use so long as they're willing to spend a little bit of time kind of figuring out                              |
| 34:11      | how they work.                                                                                                     |
| 34:12      | I would agree with that 100%.                                                                                      |
| 34:14      | I mean, Automator, if you're short on cash and you just want to get started, Automator                             |
| 34:19      | is free and it's good, but once you've got the ability to spend money or you realise                               |
| 34:27      | that there's something that you need to do that Automator can't do because Automator                               |
| 34:31      | is limited, Keyboard Maestro is definitely the next step up.                                                       |
| 34:34      | You don't need to know how to program to do any of this.                                                           |
| 34:37      | It is the magic blocks just like shortcuts.                                                                        |
| 34:41      | The Keyboard Maestro does, of course, predate shortcuts or workflow and yeah, it's excellent                       |
| 34:47      | and the developer Peter Lewis has really invested in the application and he's got his own user                     |
| 34:53      | forum as well, which I will link to in the show notes.                                                             |
| 34:55      | Of course, you're very welcome to discuss Keyboard Maestro items in our forums as well,                            |
| 35:00      | but yeah, he's got a lot of resources out there for that.                                                          |
| 35:05      | I was just talking to a listener yesterday who is doing a Keyboard Maestro script to                               |
| 35:11      | do auto-fill, form-filling mails, because there's really not many good solutions for                               |
| 35:18      | mail merge and he's using Keyboard Maestro to mail merge emails and send them even if                              |
| 35:24      | you want and I got thinking that's a great solution to a problem because quite often                               |
| 35:31      | there are weaknesses in the platform for one thing or another and I think mail merge is                            |
| 35:35      | one where the Mac isn't particularly good.                                                                         |
| 35:38      | I'm not that impressed with the way Microsoft solutions do it and with Keyboard Maestro                            |
| 35:44      | he was able to make a solution that basically works across his Mac and that's just one                             |
| 35:50      | example of solving a problem with that application.                                                                |
| 35:53      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 35:54      | Well, if that user is listening, please do share that in the forums because I'd love                               |
| 35:57      | to see it and there was a question at one point, somebody was trying to create a contract.                         |
| 36:01      | It may have been in the Mac Power Users forum actually, possibly Automators, where they                            |
| 36:07      | wanted to create a contract and they wanted to use the contacts information to fill the                            |
| 36:11      | name of the person and then they had different information that had to go in depending on                          |
| 36:15      | which event the contract was for and that sounds like a mail merge.                                                |
| 36:20      | If you're trying to generate documents, this is the other end of filing, generating the                            |
| 36:24      | documents to be files, don't forget mail merge is quite a powerful tool and as you've                              |
| 36:29      | just heard, Keyboard Maestro can even help you do that.                                                            |
| 36:31      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 36:32      | I've done a lot of that work over time because I use Keyboard Maestro for that type of stuff                       |
| 36:37      | all the time.                                                                                                      |
| 36:38      | We'll get there, we'll get there.                                                                                  |
| 36:40      | Yes.                                                                                                               |
| 36:41      | We will be circling back to that for sure.                                                                         |
| 36:43      | Yes, we've got some other feedback and completely miscellaneous feedback because I'm not sure                      |
| 36:50      | when we're going to get around to doing an episode on this and this is too good not                                |
| 36:53      | to share.                                                                                                          |
| 36:55      | When you set up a new computer, you probably want a list of the applications on your old                           |
| 36:59      | computer.                                                                                                          |
| 37:00      | This is assuming that you're either setting your current computer up from start, up from                           |
| 37:05      | scratch or you're setting up a new computer and you don't want to just transfer everything                         |
| 37:08      | over using something like Time Machine, Carbon Copy Cloner, et cetera.                                             |
| 37:12      | Well, Burk on micro.blog shared this fabulous tip, which is you can use the terminal to                            |
| 37:17      | get a list of all of the applications and save it into a text file and all you do is                               |
| 37:23      | you open up terminal on your Mac and you don't need to know how it works and you just type                         |
| 37:27      | ls slash and then applications for your applications folder and then you do a greater than symbol                  |
| 37:34      | and then you put in a file name and a file extension.                                                              |
| 37:39      | So for example, newsystemapps.txt and yeah, this will give you a list of all of your applications                  |
| 37:46      | in a text file on your computer so that you can just grab that and use that when you're                            |
| 37:51      | setting up a new machine.                                                                                          |
| 37:53      | And yeah, I thought that that was an excellent tip because that is automation.                                     |
| 37:58      | It's not as automated as just transferring everything via Time Machine, but there are                              |
| 38:01      | times when you don't want to do that.                                                                              |
| 38:03      | Yeah, it's really tough to cover terminal stuff on an audio podcast.                                               |
| 38:07      | At some point, if we do a show on maybe terminal based automation, we will screencast the heck                     |
| 38:12      | out of that one.                                                                                                   |
| 38:13      | Oh yeah, definitely.                                                                                               |
| 38:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 38:15      | And I will be putting a link to Burk's post in the show notes because he's got the terminal.                       |
| 38:23      | He's got the command written out for you there so you can literally just copy paste it and                         |
| 38:27      | use it.                                                                                                            |
| 38:28      | And when I was looking at that, JD followed up with, if you use Homebrew, you can also                             |
| 38:33      | type `brew leaves` to get a list of all the packages installed, which I thought was extremely                         |
| 38:38      | useful.                                                                                                            |
| 38:39      | So thank you to JD and Burk on Micro.blog for sharing this.                                                         |
| 38:44      | The Launch Center Pro NFC stickers, what are you doing with yours at this point?                                   |
| 38:49      | Oh, okay.                                                                                                          |
| 38:50      | Well, do you remember we recently had an episode on time tracking?                                                 |
| 38:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 38:54      | Well, time tracking, as I foresaw in that episode, has come to my workplace.                                       |
| 39:00      | And we have to do it in a specific format, in a specific system, et cetera.                                        |
| 39:04      | Basically I'm saving CSV files onto my iPhone.                                                                     |
| 39:08      | And so I'm using Launch Center Pro, so I just pick up my iPhone and I tap it on sticker                            |
| 39:13      | and it runs a workflow or a shortcut rather that runs two shortcuts.                                               |
| 39:18      | So we've talked before about running multiple, one shortcut that does lots of other things.                        |
| 39:24      | This is a shortcut that runs a stop timer shortcut and a start timer shortcut.                                     |
| 39:29      | So it stops the timer, asks me for a summary of what I did, and then it starts a new timer.                        |
| 39:35      | And it's so useful.                                                                                                |
| 39:37      | I love it.                                                                                                         |
| 39:38      | And I literally just pick up my phone and I tap it on the sticker.                                                 |
| 39:41      | And everybody else is there trying to use some clunky Windows program that they have                               |
| 39:44      | to times into and press spacebar to get it to autofill.                                                            |
| 39:48      | Why doesn't it just autofill when you click into the box?                                                          |
| 39:52      | And things like that.                                                                                              |
| 39:53      | I'm very, very happy with my solution and it only took me about 20 minutes to build.                               |
| 39:57      | So it's definitely a proprietary system.                                                                           |
| 40:00      | I'm actually currently taking a break from the toggle style timing of myself.                                      |
| 40:06      | I just find that my data quite often is bad because it is hard for me to remember to push                          |
| 40:13      | the button.                                                                                                        |
| 40:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 40:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 40:16      | And honestly, I don't need it at all times.                                                                        |
| 40:20      | I feel like I don't need that data at all times.                                                                   |
| 40:23      | I do it once in a while for a couple of weeks just to kind of check in and see how things                          |
| 40:28      | are going.                                                                                                         |
| 40:29      | And I spend a lot of my work time at my Mac where timing is actually always tracking for                           |
| 40:35      | me and I do get those reports.                                                                                     |
| 40:38      | But right now I'm taking a little break from it.                                                                   |
| 40:40      | But anyway, I'm sure I'll be back and trying it again at some point.                                               |
| 40:46      | I learn things every time I do it, but I just don't know that the investment of time to                            |
| 40:51      | try and kind of track the mental overhead of that makes sense for me right now.                                    |
| 40:55      | And it's weird for me because I do so many different things.                                                       |
| 40:58      | I find myself throwing timers all day when I'm trying to do it through that, even with                             |
| 41:03      | the automation help.                                                                                               |
| 41:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 41:05      | Well, I mean, all I do in toggle for work is I literally just track the time that I clock                          |
| 41:09      | in and the time that I clock out.                                                                                  |
| 41:11      | And until I started this podcast, I was commuting even though I'd already been home for 10 minutes.                |
| 41:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 41:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 41:17      | If you've been trying to track time and you realise that you're not perfect, that's okay.                          |
| 41:20      | That means that you're normal, like everybody else, just like us.                                                  |
| 41:24      | And on that note, we've heard from a lot of people because we've been talking about an                             |
| 41:26      | app that's not out, which we're not supposed to really do that, I guess, but Timery, which                         |
| 41:31      | is the app that's come up several times, people saying, hey, when's that coming out?                               |
| 41:35      | Because if you are using toggle to track time, this app is going to make it so much easier.                        |
| 41:40      | And all I can say is the betas are closer and closer.                                                              |
| 41:44      | I think that we're not far.                                                                                        |
| 41:46      | And I will say at the Automators Twitter account, it doesn't tweet much, it tweets when new                        |
| 41:50      | episodes come out.                                                                                                 |
| 41:51      | It makes sure that you get a link to the forum thread and links to any YouTube videos that                         |
| 41:54      | are there.                                                                                                         |
| 41:56      | But it will be tweeting when this app releases.                                                                    |
| 41:58      | So if you're not following at Automators FM on Twitter, please do so if you, well, whether                         |
| 42:04      | or not you want to hear about Timery because it will be a one-time tweet, which David and                          |
| 42:08      | I will, of course, be tweeting as well from our accounts.                                                          |
| 42:11      | But yeah, that will be an easy way to get poked when it's released if you are looking                              |
| 42:16      | for an automated way to do so.                                                                                     |
| 42:17      | I'll tell you my favourite feedback we've gotten since we started the shows from all                                |
| 42:21      | the people who write us to say, hey, they thought this stuff was not something they                                |
| 42:24      | could do.                                                                                                          |
| 42:25      | But listening to the show, watching the screencast, they're finding themselves doing it.                           |
| 42:30      | And it's an interesting muscle to develop because once you realise you have the power                              |
| 42:34      | to automate something, even if you've never been a programmer, even if you don't know                              |
| 42:39      | [[AppleScript]] and Perl and all these other things, with the tools we talk about on the                              |
| 42:43      | show, there's a lot you can automate.                                                                              |
| 42:45      | And I just love hearing from people who have been empowered by what we've been doing and                           |
| 42:49      | thanks and you guys feed us as well when you tell us about the great stuff you're doing.                           |
| 42:54      | Yes, it is extremely exciting to hear whenever somebody was like, I don't know.                                    |
| 42:59      | I don't know what I'm doing, but look, I did this thing and it works and it does what                              |
| 43:02      | I want.                                                                                                            |
| 43:03      | It's like, yes, this makes me happy.                                                                               |
| 43:07      | It's funny once you realise that you can do that, you start seeing all sorts of opportunities.                     |
| 43:10      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 43:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                              |
| 43:12      | So if you're just listening to this podcast and you're thinking like, maybe one day, try                           |
| 43:16      | doing something today or if you're very busy today, then tomorrow, but try something very                          |
| 43:21      | soon because it's great fun.                                                                                       |
| 43:24      | And once you see what you can accomplish, it really will feed into this wonderful little                           |
| 43:30      | feedback loop of success and positivity.                                                                           |
| 43:33      | On that note, I think we'll wrap this episode up.                                                                  |
| 43:36      | You've got a great guest lined up in a couple of weeks.                                                            |

| 00:00      | Hello, I'm Rose Orchard, and joined by my co-host, David Sparks.                                     |
| 00:05      | This is Automators, where we talked about how to automate your technology to do your                 |
| 00:10      | work for you.                                                                                        |
| 00:11      | Hi, David.                                                                                           |
| 00:12      | Hi, Rose.                                                                                            |
| 00:13      | I think when you say this is automators, we need to have one of those monster truck                  |
| 00:17      | voices.                                                                                              |
| 00:18      | This is automators, you know, like with Echo, with the work on that.                                 |
| 00:22      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 00:23      | Well, I'll put it in my OmniFocus for next time.                                                     |
| 00:27      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 00:28      | So, we have a fun show today.                                                                        |
| 00:30      | I'm looking forward to this one.                                                                     |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:33      | So, today, we're going to talk about making a shortcut home screen, which I'm sure some              |
| 00:38      | of our listeners have heard of, because I'm pretty certain there's a decent crossover                |
| 00:41      | between automators listeners and cortex listeners, because as CGP Gray on [[Cortex]] actually suggested  |
| 00:48      | this, and the internet seems to have gone crazy over turning your home screen into just              |
| 00:54      | shortcuts.                                                                                           |
| 00:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:56      | Yeah, I flipped out when I heard the idea, because I was doing something like, you know,             |
| 01:00      | one of the things, the themes of today's show is shortcuts to make shortcuts, you know,              |
| 01:04      | it's like it's becoming self-aware.                                                                  |
| 01:06      | I have all of these shortcuts for OmniFocus templates, you know, I've got like 30 of them,           |
| 01:13      | and so I made a shortcut that gives me a menu that I can pick from.                                  |
| 01:17      | But for some reason, my brain didn't go up with the idea of say, why don't you round                 |
| 01:21      | that up another level and put it on your home screen, and that's what Gray did.                      |
| 01:25      | And I thought it was really smart when he did it, I got so excited, I even made a little             |
| 01:28      | screencast, I'll put it in the show notes for this one, just after like a day of experimenting       |
| 01:33      | of my original take on it, although it's changed since then.                                         |
| 01:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:39      | It's one of these things, it is a very powerful tool, especially if you are launching a lot          |
| 01:43      | of shortcuts, it's very easy because then you can just press one button, and it's on                 |
| 01:47      | your home screen already, and it says, okay, do you want to do one of like these three               |
| 01:50      | things, and it just gets it done, and there's little thinking about it, and you don't have           |
| 01:55      | to talk to your phone, which I'm sure I'm not the only person, he doesn't really enjoy               |
| 01:59      | talking to my phone in public, which, you know, especially if it doesn't work, then                  |
| 02:04      | it is very annoying.                                                                                 |
| 02:06      | So the 20,000 foot view, what we're talking about is when you're in Siri shortcuts, you              |
| 02:11      | can save a shortcut as a home screen icon, or as a, as basically it looks like an app,               |
| 02:19      | you know, it puts an icon, it's got a bunch of glyphs you can choose from, you can pick              |
| 02:23      | a background colour, you can even import your own custom image to be the icon.                       |
| 02:29      | So in essence, you can turn a Siri shortcut into an app button, and the idea Gray had                |
| 02:35      | was what if I did that, and instead of just running a single shortcut, I put a menu of               |
| 02:40      | shortcuts in there, and actually the way we're going to talk about it today, it's not just           |
| 02:44      | shortcuts, we're talking about running from these things.                                            |
| 02:47      | So you put on your home screen, a single app button that will do multiple, launch multiple           |
| 02:53      | apps or specific tasks in multiple apps.                                                             |
| 02:57      | And then suddenly your home screen is not traditional apps, you bought off the app store,            |
| 03:02      | but instead these launchers and other utilities you've created out of the Siri shortcuts app.        |
| 03:07      | It's kind of fun.                                                                                    |
| 03:09      | And in a lot of ways powerful.                                                                       |
| 03:10      | Yeah, it's extremely good fun.                                                                       |
| 03:12      | And it's actually a great intro to shortcuts for somebody who's not so familiar with it,             |
| 03:17      | because there's very little to it.                                                                   |
| 03:20      | I mean, we're going to go into some more of the crazy things that you can do with this               |
| 03:24      | later.                                                                                               |
| 03:25      | But essentially, all we're doing here is a choose from menu.                                         |
| 03:28      | And then inside of the menu item, you either have a open app or a run shortcut action.               |
| 03:35      | And that's it.                                                                                       |
| 03:36      | That's all of the craziness done.                                                                    |
| 03:39      | The most difficult part is choosing the correct colour and icon to represent your shortcut.          |
| 03:43      | But you could, of course, just use an image from your photo library instead if you wanted            |
| 03:47      | to.                                                                                                  |
| 03:48      | And we've got advice for that in the outline, so we're going to get to that as well.                 |
| 03:52      | So why do it?                                                                                        |
| 03:53      | Number one, it gives you direct access to things like you can launch into a specific                 |
| 03:59      | OmniFocus perspective.                                                                               |
| 04:01      | I have one that has got a list of all the things I do on OmniFocus, like the specific                |
| 04:07      | perspectives, the review, because I can also use URLs, you know, [[URL Schemes]] in this.                |
| 04:12      | And so rather than just going to the OmniFocus icon, I go to the shortcut and open OmniFocus         |
| 04:18      | exactly where I want it so I don't get distracted.                                                   |
| 04:20      | Mm-hmm.                                                                                              |
| 04:21      | Yeah, that's something that always happens with me, whether it's email or OmniFocus or               |
| 04:25      | my calendar.                                                                                         |
| 04:26      | I open it to do something and something else catches my attention.                                   |
| 04:31      | And it's like up with this girl.                                                                     |
| 04:33      | I'm just gone.                                                                                       |
| 04:34      | I was thinking that.                                                                                 |
| 04:35      | It's like we're all dug.                                                                             |
| 04:37      | We're all dug.                                                                                       |
| 04:38      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 04:39      | And it's very easy to get sidetracked into all of these rabbit holes, and this is a great            |
| 04:43      | way to avoid that.                                                                                   |
| 04:44      | So especially if you're somebody who struggles with concentrating on things, or maybe you            |
| 04:48      | just want to up your focus on this sort of thing, it's very useful.                                  |
| 04:52      | Even better if you get distracted, I mean, one of the easiest ways to get distracted                 |
| 04:56      | is you open your email to do a specific task and something in the inbox catches your eye.            |
| 05:03      | You can make shortcuts to take you to specific areas of the mail application or your third           |
| 05:08      | party mail app of choice.                                                                            |
| 05:10      | So say, just take me to the Max Barking inbox, and you can do that, or you can have a shortcut       |
| 05:16      | that just opens a compose window in [[Drafts]], and then you can avoid the mail app altogether.          |
| 05:22      | So this stuff can get really powerful and really help you get better at getting your                 |
| 05:27      | work done.                                                                                           |
| 05:28      | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 05:29      | And of course, it allows you to do things as well like stack actions.                                |
| 05:33      | So say for example, that whenever I sit down to start podcasting with David, I always want           |
| 05:37      | to have the lights on full in the bedroom at this time of year, because it's really dark,            |
| 05:42      | and I need to make sure that my phone's in do not disturb.                                           |
| 05:45      | And I want to open my [[Drafts]] note for this.                                                          |
| 05:48      | I do this on my phone, because if I type on my laptop keyboard, it's very loud, and it               |
| 05:52      | sounds like I hate my keyboard, then I do that, I press one button, and it does all                  |
| 05:56      | those three things.                                                                                  |
| 05:57      | But all I see on my phone is the [[Drafts]] app.                                                         |
| 06:00      | And then I'm aware that the lights have increased around me, but it's really useful for things       |
| 06:03      | like that.                                                                                           |
| 06:04      | Yeah, and I want to talk about that more with some examples later, but why not have it do            |
| 06:10      | two things?                                                                                          |
| 06:11      | Like going back to that OmniFocus reference, if I'm going into the OmniFocus MacSparky               |
| 06:16      | planning OmniFocus perspective, it will go ahead and set a timer for MacSparky stuff.                |
| 06:25      | So I'm actually setting a timer and going into do the work at the same time.                         |
| 06:30      | And it's just one step, but that's the kind of stuff that's the reason we make this show.            |
| 06:36      | You automate these things and it makes your life easier.                                             |
| 06:38      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 06:40      | And speaking of making life easier, this might actually be a really useful tool for the less         |
| 06:44      | technical people as well.                                                                            |
| 06:45      | So say, for example, you've got a relative who's not so tech savvy, and they've got                  |
| 06:48      | an iPad, but they're struggling to remember that, I don't know, [[Safari]] is for the internet           |
| 06:53      | and the internet, if they type in, I don't know, bbc.co.uk, then they get the BBC News               |
| 06:59      | website.                                                                                             |
| 07:00      | They get a news icon on their home screen that opens the BBC web page for them.                      |
| 07:05      | And it can either open that in the in-app [[Safari]] browser or in the main [[Safari]] app, depending        |
| 07:10      | on what you want.                                                                                    |
| 07:11      | And you set that up for them, and then they just know, I tap on this one, which has got              |
| 07:15      | the name that you've given it and the icon that you've given it, which makes it really               |
| 07:19      | easy to help them later when they go, wait, where is it?                                             |
| 07:22      | It's the red one with the newspaper icon.                                                            |
| 07:24      | They tap on that and they're there.                                                                  |
| 07:27      | And that, I think, is something, our audience members are probably going to be the people            |
| 07:31      | setting that up, but it's a nice thing to keep in mind for that as well.                             |
| 07:37      | Yeah, that's a really good idea.                                                                     |
| 07:38      | I was just thinking about one of my sisters would, like, I know there's certain things               |
| 07:42      | she does that sometimes confuse her.                                                                 |
| 07:44      | I could set up a button on her home screen that just does it all for her with Siri shortcuts.        |
| 07:50      | And Thanksgiving, as we record this, is just a couple days away.                                     |
| 07:53      | So now I think I'm going to be a hero on Thanksgiving.                                               |
| 07:55      | There we go.                                                                                         |
| 07:57      | One of the things that occurred to me when I first heard Gray talking about this was                 |
| 08:01      | contextualising work, and I'm going to go into detail in this episode about what I mean              |
| 08:06      | by this.                                                                                             |
| 08:07      | I'm going to share the ones I've created, but I love the idea of having a single button              |
| 08:11      | for MacSparky, and in it, I've got jumps to email boxes.                                             |
| 08:16      | I've got jumps to OmniFocus perspectives.                                                            |
| 08:19      | I've got jumps to my writing apps.                                                                   |
| 08:20      | I've got jumps to my outline for my newest field guide I'm working on, and all this stuff            |
| 08:25      | combined in one button.                                                                              |
| 08:27      | I just love that I can go to one icon on my home screen and from there, jump off into                |
| 08:31      | all the stuff I usually do when I'm wearing my MacSparky hat.                                        |
| 08:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 08:36      | It is extremely useful for people that wear multiple hats, and in some ways, everybody               |
| 08:40      | wears multiple hats.                                                                                 |
| 08:41      | You know, you likely have a job and you do something at home, or maybe you're a gardener             |
| 08:45      | and, you know, you love going for walks, and you can then have a gardening hat and a walking         |
| 08:51      | hat and a relaxing at home hat, which I hope everybody has, and that's really nice because           |
| 08:58      | then you're focusing and it's not like you're there and you just want to check, what was             |
| 09:03      | that show that I wanted to watch next, and you get sidetracked by the email that came                |
| 09:06      | in from work, you know, that you can avoid that happening, which is very nice.                       |
| 09:11      | And probably the other reason why you should consider doing this is just it's faster.                |
| 09:16      | I mean, I've been doing it for a few months now, and if you do it right, you can make                |
| 09:20      | it get you to whatever you need to do faster, more efficiently, and, you know, push all              |
| 09:27      | of our automator buttons.                                                                            |
| 09:29      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 09:30      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 09:31      | All right.                                                                                           |
| 09:32      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 09:33      | So hopefully we've sold it.                                                                          |
| 09:35      | We tried hard to sell that.                                                                          |
| 09:37      | There's definitely a lot of advantages.                                                              |
| 09:40      | And if at this point you're thinking, I don't know, wait and listen to the examples because          |
| 09:45      | the examples are where you're going to go, okay, now I get it if you're still stuck at               |
| 09:49      | this point.                                                                                          |
| 09:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 09:51      | This is, as Rowe said, a very great way to get comfy with shortcuts because, you know,               |
| 09:57      | we've talked about shortcuts before and it can get advanced.                                         |
| 09:59      | I know I did a whole video course on it, but the, but one of the easiest commands you can            |
| 10:05      | do in shortcuts is just open up shortcuts, type in the search bar, choose from menu.                 |
| 10:10      | And it's just a command in shortcuts.                                                                |
| 10:11      | And when you drag that in, it creates a shortcut for you that gives you a short menu, I think        |
| 10:16      | by default it has three or four in there, maybe five, I don't remember now that I, anyway.           |
| 10:22      | I think it's three.                                                                                  |
| 10:23      | I'm just going to double check.                                                                      |
| 10:25      | And by the way, it's got a list in there and you can just go in and edit the name.                   |
| 10:29      | So you could make one that says, just, you know, you can pick the applications you want              |
| 10:35      | to launch via shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 10:37      | So you could say one is Fantastical and one is OmniFocus and one is Air Mail.                        |
| 10:42      | And you just type the names in there and then, and then it creates a list below and inside           |
| 10:50      | you can just launch the applications.                                                                |
| 10:52      | There's a Siri shortcut command to launch the application.                                           |
| 10:54      | Let me open mine.                                                                                    |
| 10:56      | I don't remember the exact phrase for that command.                                                  |
| 10:59      | It's open app.                                                                                       |
| 11:01      | Open app.                                                                                            |
| 11:02      | There we go.                                                                                         |
| 11:03      | And so all you have to do then is go, you copy in the task open app underneath, for instance,        |
| 11:10      | of the Air Mail one you copy in the open app command in Siri.                                        |
| 11:15      | So you just type search open app and drag it in.                                                     |
| 11:18      | And then you, then it gives you a button that you can just press and select any of your              |
| 11:23      | apps or at least most of your apps.                                                                  |
| 11:25      | Some of them don't show up.                                                                          |
| 11:26      | We'll talk about that later, but Air Mail is there.                                                  |
| 11:28      | So you tap Air Mail.                                                                                 |
| 11:29      | Now, when you run that shortcut and you tap on the Air Mail button, it's going to go and             |
| 11:35      | open the Air Mail application.                                                                       |
| 11:37      | So at the most basic level, this is a launcher.                                                      |
| 11:40      | You can, and then you can add additional ones to the choose from menu.                               |
| 11:43      | So you can have 15 of them if you want, you know, whatever you want.                                 |
| 11:46      | Like if you want to use just to replace a folder, you could do that.                                 |
| 11:50      | But it's just a very simple idea of choose from menu and open app.                                   |
| 11:55      | And you can take this one step further as well.                                                      |
| 11:57      | And you can use the run shortcut action as well.                                                     |
| 12:00      | So say you've already got a great shortcut that you've made and it does exactly what                 |
| 12:04      | you want it to do.                                                                                   |
| 12:05      | Well, you don't need to sit there and manually go back and forth between your two shortcuts          |
| 12:09      | checking what actions you did and how you did it and copying things over or recreating               |
| 12:14      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 12:15      | You can just use the run shortcut option.                                                            |
| 12:16      | And actually, if you turn off the show while running action, then some shortcuts are going           |
| 12:21      | to run a lot faster, especially if it's a very long complex shortcut.                                |
| 12:25      | It will run faster because the iPhone or your iPad will not need to show the UI of this              |
| 12:29      | as it's running.                                                                                     |
| 12:31      | And it works exactly the same way the open app action works.                                         |
| 12:34      | You choose whichever shortcut it is.                                                                 |
| 12:36      | There's a nice search option, and then you can just have it run for you.                             |
| 12:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 12:41      | Like I was just thinking an example of this would be, and here's a real simple one.                  |
| 12:46      | I take a walk usually every day.                                                                     |
| 12:49      | And so when I take a walk, there's a couple things I do.                                             |
| 12:52      | I set a timer to say I'm going to be walking because I'm anal retentive about time tracking.         |
| 12:58      | And I listen to a podcast.                                                                           |
| 12:59      | So while I walk, so I just have a shortcut called start a walk and it starts the timer               |
| 13:06      | and then it opens up overcast.                                                                       |
| 13:09      | And so I just click that one button on my home screen.                                               |
| 13:12      | It does those two tasks for me.                                                                      |
| 13:15      | And I guess I'm kind of giving a head a little bit, but that's an example of a choose from           |
| 13:22      | menu where I've got a two step, I've created in this, it's a small workflow inside the               |
| 13:27      | workflow.                                                                                            |
| 13:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 13:29      | And that works really well.                                                                          |
| 13:30      | The only thing that I would mention, if you are planning on just creating a shortcut                 |
| 13:35      | inside each of these menu items is don't forget the menu item itself does not give you anything.     |
| 13:41      | So there is a line inside and it actually does in this case show between the name of                 |
| 13:47      | the menu item and the action, but the action below that menu item does not receive the               |
| 13:52      | name of the menu item.                                                                               |
| 13:53      | So that is definitely something that you need to keep in mind if you're new to shortcuts             |
| 13:56      | and you're building one of these.                                                                    |
| 13:59      | If you need that word, you're going to have to use a text action or something to get that            |
| 14:03      | in there.                                                                                            |
| 14:04      | Yeah. And the other thing I would say is like, for instance, this walk one, that could be            |
| 14:08      | a separate shortcut and then you use it as a run shortcut.                                           |
| 14:12      | So you've got a simple two step shortcut combined under a choose action.                             |
| 14:16      | So this is one of the challenges of doing this with audio is that you don't get to see               |
| 14:20      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 14:21      | And that's why we're going to add videos to the show notes so you can watch that.                    |
| 14:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 14:25      | We're going to make sure that we have a demo video showing you how to build these and simple         |
| 14:28      | one and a more complicated one as well.                                                              |
| 14:29      | So you can graduate from one to the next.                                                            |
| 14:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 14:33      | And it's really powerful as you start doing this and you start, like I said, thinking                |
| 14:37      | in terms of context and just groupings, I mean, what are the folders that you have on                |
| 14:42      | your home screen right now that you frequently go and do things in and, you know, how can            |
| 14:47      | you take those another step?                                                                         |
| 14:49      | And this is where it happens.                                                                        |
| 14:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 14:52      | You can definitely, you can start with just the very simple stuff and really make it super           |
| 14:56      | complicated and awesome if you want to, which is of course, you know, where we tend-to-end           |
| 15:01      | up doing things that everybody is welcome at every level.                                            |
| 15:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 15:04      | We're going to bring you along, man.                                                                 |
| 15:05      | We want you to go crazy with this stuff.                                                             |
| 15:06      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 15:07      | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 15:08      | In fact, let's start talking about some of the ones we've made that are cool.                        |
| 15:11      | But before we do that, you want to talk about our sponsor?                                           |
| 15:14      | Yes, I do.                                                                                           |
| 15:15      | So today we are sponsored by the Omni Group, who are makers of, among other applications,            |
| 15:20      | OmniFocus 3.                                                                                         |
| 15:21      | And OmniFocus 3 has been updated this year.                                                          |
| 15:24      | It is a fabulous new application and it has, most importantly, tags instead of context.              |
| 15:31      | So if you've used OmniFocus before, you might have been aware there was a singular context           |
| 15:35      | for an action or a task to complete.                                                                 |
| 15:38      | Now you have tags.                                                                                   |
| 15:39      | So for example, if I am waiting on David so that he can choose the next step, the topic              |
| 15:44      | for the next episode of Automators, then I can give that task both waiting on and David              |
| 15:49      | so that when I look at my David list, I know I should make sure that we know what we're              |
| 15:54      | talking about next time.                                                                             |
| 15:56      | The forecast view also shows calendar events now, which is really useful so that when you            |
| 16:00      | look at your day, you can see realistically how much you're going to get done.                       |
| 16:04      | There's also more flexible repeats.                                                                  |
| 16:07      | Batch editing has made it to iOS, along with a flexible inspector.                                   |
| 16:10      | So if you never used defer dates, well, you can move that out of your regular inspector              |
| 16:15      | view.                                                                                                |

| 16:33      | OmniFocus accomplish more every day.                                                                 |
| 16:35      | Our thanks to the Omni Group for their support of this show and Relay FM.                            |
| 16:39      | I thought maybe to begin with, I would share one that is a very simple Siri shortcut app             |
| 16:47      | home-screwing launcher.                                                                              |
| 16:49      | And it's the list of apps that were always on my home screen that take a lot of space.               |
| 16:56      | And all I really need to do is get into them.                                                        |
| 16:59      | So I combine them, and they're all in what I call the communicate category.                          |
| 17:02      | So I have a simple shortcut called choose from menu.                                                 |
| 17:06      | And in it, I've got several functions.                                                               |
| 17:09      | There's mail, messages, [[Slack]], discourse, Twitter, and an air mail, because I've been                |
| 17:16      | playing with air mail thanks to Rose.                                                                |
| 17:17      | So I've got two mail apps in there.                                                                  |
| 17:19      | But then all it does is it's a launcher.                                                             |
| 17:22      | So for each one of those, there's an entry, and underneath I have the open app command               |
| 17:26      | for the various applications.                                                                        |
| 17:28      | And as a result, I'm able to get all of this into one button.                                        |
| 17:32      | I mean, this is the most basic use of this concept.                                                  |
| 17:36      | There's nothing fancy.                                                                               |
| 17:37      | There's no additional Siri shortcut action going on.                                                 |
| 17:39      | I'm not writing any specific tasks.                                                                  |
| 17:43      | But I've just got an easy way to launch myself into all of the apps I use to communicate.            |
| 17:48      | That is a really great first example.                                                                |
| 17:51      | My next example is a little bit more complicated.                                                    |
| 17:54      | It's my home action.                                                                                 |
| 17:57      | So this one, it's a yellow home icon, and it's called home because I'm not very creative             |
| 18:02      | with these things.                                                                                   |
| 18:03      | But it presents a list of different home kit scenes for me to run.                                   |
| 18:06      | Because of course, all of these are available to us in shortcuts.                                    |
| 18:10      | But the great thing about this is that I can choose.                                                 |
| 18:14      | So if I try to run it before six o'clock in the morning, or actually seven o'clock in                |
| 18:19      | the morning, I just modified its day, then it only shows me a few scenes to choose from.             |
| 18:24      | And then if I try and run it after seven o'clock in the morning, it will show me more scenes.        |
| 18:28      | If I try and run it late in the evening, then it suggests that I should go to bed and put            |
| 18:32      | the time for bed one right under my thumb, which is really useful.                                   |
| 18:37      | And that just allows me to access the home kit scenes that I actually really want to                 |
| 18:41      | use at the right time of day.                                                                        |
| 18:43      | So now, how are you doing that?                                                                      |
| 18:46      | How are you setting it so it's aware of the time and giving you different views?                     |
| 18:51      | So I am just doing the time action, or rather, it's called the date action.                          |
| 18:56      | And then I format that.                                                                              |
| 18:57      | So I just do HH in lower case, because that gives me two-digit hour.                                 |
| 19:03      | And then I check if it's less than seven, then it does one thing.                                    |
| 19:09      | And if it's more than, I want to say, eight PM, it does something else, nine PM, sorry,              |
| 19:14      | I've just double checked.                                                                            |
| 19:16      | And then other than that, everything else goes into the other category.                              |
| 19:20      | So it's just an if statement, you're checking the time and using it as a message inside              |
| 19:25      | one another.                                                                                         |
| 19:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:27      | Nice.                                                                                                |
| 19:28      | You should share a screenshot of that if you can.                                                    |
| 19:29      | Yes, I will do.                                                                                      |
| 19:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:32      | One I've got that's kind of in between those two is I mentioned to it earlier.                       |
| 19:37      | And that's my OmniSelect, I just call it OmniSelect, because it's just the thing where I go and      |
| 19:44      | get access to my most commonly used Omni Group, I'm sorry, OmniFocus things.                         |
| 19:50      | And I've got a bunch of perspectives in OmniFocus, like I have them for planning on MacSparky,       |
| 19:58      | on the legal and on my personal side.                                                                |
| 20:00      | And each one of those perspectives is a deferred date-based perspective filtered for flags,          |
| 20:10      | because most of my tasks don't have start dates.                                                     |
| 20:12      | But in terms of planning, the flagged items are the ones I'm trying to pay most attention            |
| 20:16      | to or the ones that have a due date attached to them.                                                |
| 20:19      | So I can tap on any one of those three items and it brings me to that specific perspective           |
| 20:24      | for like a planning forward.                                                                         |
| 20:26      | And I use that in the evenings when I'm planning the next day.                                       |
| 20:29      | At the same time, it runs into toggle and throws a switch for setting a timer for whether            |
| 20:36      | I'm planning personal, planning Sparky, or planning legal.                                           |
| 20:39      | So I get a good effective time tracking in addition to getting myself to the appropriate             |
| 20:44      | perspective.                                                                                         |
| 20:46      | OmniFocus also has certain perspectives that are available to you via URL.                           |
| 20:53      | And for instance, the projects one is at OmniFocus colon slash slash slash projects.                 |
| 21:00      | So if I want to see the projects, I've got that as a button.                                         |
| 21:04      | So I just use the URL command, you know, which puts that URL into the system and then opens          |
| 21:10      | the URL and it gets me there too.                                                                    |
| 21:13      | I could run timers on those if I wanted to, but I don't because they're not specific to              |
| 21:17      | a particular area of my life.                                                                        |
| 21:19      | And then just to get more meta, I was talking earlier about I have all these templates.              |
| 21:25      | So I have another like a third level shortcut, which is a menu of all those templates.               |
| 21:31      | And because there's so many of them, there's actually a fourth level to this.                        |
| 21:36      | I hope you're tracking with me.                                                                      |
| 21:37      | So if I press the templates button in this OmniSelect, it brings me to another series                |
| 21:42      | shortcut that says, are you making a Sparky template, a legal template or a personal template?       |
| 21:48      | And I click one of those.                                                                            |
| 21:50      | And also a couple of the ones that I use all the time are in that level.                             |
| 21:54      | But if I click on like MacSparky, then it gives me a list of like 12 different templates             |
| 21:58      | I've made for MacSparky projects.                                                                    |
| 22:00      | Now I know that sounds a little nutty, but it takes a lot longer to describe than to                 |
| 22:05      | actually activate.                                                                                   |
| 22:07      | So I just tap a few buttons and then I've got the template activated and I don't have                |
| 22:11      | to go into shortcuts and scroll through my big long list of shortcuts to find the one                |
| 22:16      | I want.                                                                                              |
| 22:17      | I always get it started.                                                                             |
| 22:18      | And when I want to work in OmniFocus, I avoid distraction by getting to exactly the place            |
| 22:22      | I need to be.                                                                                        |
| 22:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 22:24      | That's a really useful one.                                                                          |
| 22:26      | If I had more templates, then I would do that and I need to actually start making some               |
| 22:30      | more work templates because I've received a bunch of projects at work, which are all                 |
| 22:34      | quite similar.                                                                                       |
| 22:35      | I'm a big fan of checklists.                                                                         |
| 22:37      | I think that anytime you can put a checklist on a project that you're going to do, you               |
| 22:41      | have a much better chance of finishing it.                                                           |
| 22:43      | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 22:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 22:45      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 22:46      | I'll give another example.                                                                           |
| 22:47      | I have a travel one, which what it does is I use Tripit as my travel service.                        |
| 22:54      | And that means I forward all of my travel itinerary bookings there and it just makes an itinerary    |
| 23:00      | for me so that it knows that, for example, next January, I'm probably going to be in                 |
| 23:03      | Seattle because I've already booked a hotel and forwarded that reservation there.                    |
| 23:08      | So what this does, the first thing it does, it checks my Tripit calendar to see if there's           |
| 23:12      | an all day event today.                                                                              |
| 23:14      | And if yes, it shows me one set of applications.                                                     |
| 23:17      | And if there is not an all day event, it shows me my Vienna and Austria applications because         |
| 23:21      | those are the ones I actually need when I'm here.                                                    |
| 23:24      | And that's it.                                                                                       |
| 23:26      | It's quite simple, really.                                                                           |
| 23:28      | Nice.                                                                                                |
| 23:29      | Nice.                                                                                                |
| 23:30      | I got one here that is a, it's more of a shortcut, but it can be incorporated into, it's more        |
| 23:35      | of a traditional shortcut, but it can be incorporated into this method.                              |
| 23:40      | And it's something, it's a work in progress.                                                         |
| 23:41      | I'm going to try and finish it and share this one by the time we publish this episode.               |
| 23:46      | But I call it take a nap, you know, because I like taking naps when I have time.                     |
| 23:52      | But I can only take a short nap if I sleep longer than like 45 minutes and I fall apart.             |
| 23:57      | I guess there's like science there.                                                                  |
| 23:59      | Like you go into REM sleep and it's harder to wake up and all that.                                  |
| 24:03      | So when I, when I throw the shortcut, it gets the current date adds 35 minutes and then              |
| 24:07      | sets a timer for 35 minutes and then set turns on do not disturb.                                    |
| 24:14      | And that's great.                                                                                    |
| 24:15      | The one thing I want to do to this is I want to get the date math in there to automatically          |
| 24:19      | turn off do not disturb.                                                                             |
| 24:21      | And I'm sure there's a way to do that.                                                               |
| 24:22      | I did something similar to this with some of my date calculation shortcuts in the past.              |
| 24:28      | I just haven't had time to go in and set it up properly.                                             |
| 24:31      | But I'm going to, by the time I'm done, it's not only going to show me a timer for 35 minutes,       |
| 24:35      | it's also going to turn on do not disturb and then turn it off automatically for me.                 |
| 24:40      | So I'll have that done by the time we publish this show.                                             |
| 24:43      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 24:44      | The one thing I would note is that the very least time of recording, there is a bug in               |
| 24:47      | some versions of shortcuts where do not disturb doesn't work with the beta.                          |
| 24:51      | So if you have the beta version, then switch to the app store version and then that will             |
| 24:55      | fix your do not disturb issues.                                                                      |
| 24:56      | Yeah, I got a message about that recently, like it said it would need to access something            |
| 25:02      | to do not disturb working.                                                                           |
| 25:05      | My guess is by the time, hopefully the betas, they're actually doing pretty frequent betas           |
| 25:10      | for the Siri shortcuts app.                                                                          |
| 25:12      | So hopefully they'll have that fixed in the next version.                                            |
| 25:14      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 25:15      | The exact error message it says, this action requires "donotdisturbintents" to be installed.         |
| 25:20      | That's all together, which is why I said it so quickly.                                              |
| 25:23      | Though, if you're listening to me at two times speed on overcast, you won't have noticed             |
| 25:30      | a difference.                                                                                        |
| 25:31      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 25:32      | Like you mentioned earlier, David, I have several different hats and I have several                  |
| 25:36      | different shortcuts which show me different applications based on which hat I'm wearing.             |
| 25:41      | So I have an automated shortcut, a sweet setup shortcut when I'm doing quick tips to the             |
| 25:46      | sweet setup, my Mac stories shortcut and learn on me focus, which they list a variety of             |
| 25:52      | things.                                                                                              |
| 25:53      | So they list different apps that I might need to get stuff done.                                     |
| 25:57      | They link to my OmniFocus perspectives, they link to my [[Drafts]] workspaces, as well as any            |
| 26:01      | shortcuts that I might run as part of wearing this hat.                                              |
| 26:05      | And that's really useful just to get everything into one place.                                      |
| 26:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 26:10      | This whole idea of contextual shortcuts, I think, is where you get the real payoff with              |
| 26:15      | this.                                                                                                |
| 26:16      | And I had talked earlier about it, but just to share my MacSparky shortcut, which is                 |
| 26:23      | a lightning bolt, because I think that's cool.                                                       |
| 26:26      | But there's just so many different things I do, and there's some of them that are very               |
| 26:30      | simple.                                                                                              |
| 26:31      | One of them is just inbox.                                                                           |
| 26:32      | So if I tap on that, it takes me to the MacSparky [[Airmail]] inbox for the MacSparky account.       |
| 26:40      | I don't see the inbox for the other accounts, I just see that one.                                   |
| 26:43      | But also, a lot of these I have timers running, so just to take for granted that if it's something   |
| 26:47      | that I can attribute to a specific area of my life, I'm going to throw a timer on.                   |
| 26:53      | And then there's multiples.                                                                          |
| 26:55      | And then the OmniFocus perspectives, I talked earlier about my OmniSelect application, where         |
| 27:04      | I can pick among my OmniFocus tasks, but there's no reason they have to live just there.             |
| 27:08      | I mean, one of the nice things about this is you can have redundancy.                                |
| 27:12      | And so if I'm looking at the MacSparky thing, getting into the various perspectives that             |
| 27:17      | are directly related to MacSparky are also in the MacSparky button.                                  |
| 27:22      | So I can always get to these things easily, no matter where I'm going.                               |
| 27:27      | If I have an idea for a new post, like sometimes I'm wandering around, I have an idea for a          |
| 27:33      | new post.                                                                                            |
| 27:34      | In fact, I just had one this morning, and I'm going to write up rows about all the low-hanging       |
| 27:37      | fruit in iOS.                                                                                        |
| 27:38      | I'm tired of people saying that it's just an iPad, but there's some things Apple needs               |
| 27:43      | to do, like they need to fix, like you should be able to create a folder and do better tags          |
| 27:48      | and stuff.                                                                                           |
| 27:49      | So I have this whole idea.                                                                           |
| 27:50      | But I want to write a post on that.                                                                  |
| 27:54      | So I've got this cool little button here on my MacSparky list that opens a new OmniFocus             |
| 28:00      | task.                                                                                                |
| 28:01      | But it's not just a new OmniFocus task, it's one that's intended to be a blog post.                  |
| 28:05      | So the name says write post about already.                                                           |
| 28:08      | So I already wrote the first three words of the input.                                               |
| 28:13      | I've got it assigned to the project, I've got all the tasks, I'm sorry, all the context              |
| 28:17      | or tags.                                                                                             |
| 28:18      | It says context in Siri Shortcut still, because I don't know whatever, but it does take tags.        |
| 28:23      | So you throw tags in there, and I've even got the ability to edit it in OmniFocus right              |
| 28:28      | away if I want to.                                                                                   |
| 28:29      | So it's just taking a whole bunch of steps off my usual method.                                      |
| 28:36      | Like if I wanted to just create a new task and OmniFocus about writing a blog post, all              |
| 28:41      | that metadata I would have to fill in when I opened OmniFocus and went to the inbox.                 |
| 28:45      | But because I've created this kind of shortcut, it allows me to just have to type in the exact       |
| 28:51      | name of the task and hit return or hit enter, and all the other metadata is already there            |
| 28:56      | because I've pre-populated it.                                                                       |
| 28:59      | I've got ones for show prep, for the various shows that I work on, and it runs timers and            |
| 29:05      | brings me to the Google Doc or the Quip Doc or the Apple Note, because I do, we work in              |
| 29:12      | different platforms for the different shows I'm on, but it knows that and just gets me               |
| 29:16      | there.                                                                                               |
| 29:18      | One of them I'm doing right now is I'm working on a, I'm making a [[Keyboard Maestro]] field             |
| 29:22      | guide Rose.                                                                                          |
| 29:23      | It's a big secret, but I'm not such a secret anymore, and I'm hoping it'll come out in               |
| 29:27      | January, but I've been working extensively on working with the app, and I'm spending                 |
| 29:31      | a whole bunch of time in an Omni Outliner outlined for it.                                           |
| 29:34      | So I've got that document now as a shortcut entry, and once I finish and ship this thing,            |
| 29:41      | that'll go away and something else will replace it, but for now, with just one tap, I can            |
| 29:45      | get right to that document and make a change or addition to it.                                      |
| 29:49      | And there's more here too.                                                                           |
| 29:50      | I've got my node stuff, just all the things I regularly do as MacSparky are here, and                |
| 29:58      | it allows me to get to them very easily.                                                             |
| 30:00      | Everyone I've got in here is the admin panel for the learn.macsparky site, if a customer             |
| 30:05      | has a problem, I can get to it very quickly, and I'm constantly adding and refining this.            |
| 30:12      | And I did a similar thing on the legal side, which has got a different set of things.                |
| 30:15      | It's got the billings and the client matters and all that stuff, but all that is under               |
| 30:20      | one button on my home screen, and I just love, love, love it.                                        |
| 30:24      | It almost feels like it changes the way iOS can work for me.                                         |
| 30:29      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 30:30      | I've actually found, because I've got some things that I'm working on that I really                  |
| 30:33      | want to spend more time on, I've actually put these as top-level items in a few of my                |
| 30:37      | shortcuts, because then when I open it and try to run it, it's like, okay, right, well,              |
| 30:41      | it's all very well that you want to sit down and watch Netflix, but you really wanted to             |
| 30:44      | do this thing.                                                                                       |
| 30:45      | Ah, right, okay, well, actually, yeah, I am going to sit down and get on with that as                |
| 30:49      | well.                                                                                                |
| 30:50      | Obviously, it's still up to me to find the motivation to actually get on with it, but                |
| 30:53      | it's nice having that little reminder there to prompt me to do it and then go, okay, yeah,           |
| 30:58      | actually, I am going to go and work on this right now.                                               |
| 31:00      | Yeah, it's a way to kind of even encourage behaviour.                                                |
| 31:03      | Yes, definitely, which you can also use it to discourage behaviour as well.                          |
| 31:07      | So your communication buttons start with might include Twitter, but if you've decided that           |
| 31:11      | maybe you're not so keen on Twitter, then you might decide in a few weeks to hold that               |
| 31:15      | one out and make it a little harder to get a Twitter for you, which everybody can do                 |
| 31:20      | whatever it is they want with this, because of course, it's extremely flexible.                      |
| 31:25      | I forgot to comment earlier when you had made mention that you had one that included home            |
| 31:29      | kit, like common home kit tasks.                                                                     |
| 31:33      | I think that's a great use for this because home kit is actually a little tedious to get             |
| 31:37      | to.                                                                                                  |
| 31:38      | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 31:39      | You can get to it through the control centre or you can get through it through the app,              |
| 31:42      | but it's just not that easy to get to the things you want to do.                                     |
| 31:45      | I think this is a great example, although if I understand it right, you actually have                |
| 31:51      | limited access to home kit through Siri Shortcuts.                                                   |
| 31:53      | You don't have the ability to address a specific item.                                               |
| 31:56      | No, you don't.                                                                                       |
| 31:57      | You only have access to scenes, unfortunately, at least at the time of recording, knowing            |
| 32:02      | us they'll probably have changed that by the time we release this.                                   |
| 32:05      | I hope that's true.                                                                                  |
| 32:07      | They have, since we started, actually added the option to choose a home kit scene instead            |
| 32:12      | of only having them donated, which is really nice.                                                   |
| 32:17      | So you just create scenes for the stuff you want, but just think of the most common lighting         |
| 32:22      | and whatever setups you have and just create some scenes, combine them all under a single            |
| 32:27      | Siri Shortcut, and then you can have it accessible directly from your home screen.                   |
| 32:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 32:33      | Of course, this is really nice in tandem with what I mentioned earlier, which is giving              |
| 32:37      | myself specific ones at specific times because I'm sure most people have got, maybe they             |
| 32:42      | have slightly warmer lights in the evening than they do in the morning because a whiter              |
| 32:47      | light will actually help you wake up whereas a more yellow or red light will actually help           |
| 32:52      | you go to sleep.                                                                                     |
| 32:54      | So if you are doing things like that, which I have been at least playing with, and it                |
| 32:58      | has been working quite effectively for me, I have to say, that maybe that's the placebo              |
| 33:02      | effect, then it's nice to have just the right ones prompted shown to you at the right times.         |
| 33:10      | And it's also perhaps useful if you are trying to get some family members on board with home         |
| 33:14      | care instead of them going, like, which button, I don't understand this, just run this and           |
| 33:21      | choose the one you want, oh, right, okay, got it.                                                    |
| 33:25      | That's nice.                                                                                         |
| 33:26      | Just to finish up on a couple more examples, like you had talked about with me offline               |
| 33:31      | about your communications one, and you go a little deeper than I do, I'm just launching              |
| 33:35      | apps that you are actually addressing tasks inside these apps, right?                                |
| 33:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 33:41      | So communication one, I actually don't list communication methods, I list people.                    |
| 33:46      | These are people that I frequently communicate with, like my parents, my boyfriend, David,           |
| 33:51      | various other friends, and I tap on the person and it then takes me to that person in whatever       |
| 33:57      | communication method it is, usually by opening a message to this person.                             |
| 34:01      | So for example, in my message, you can just have it open and you can type a message there            |
| 34:08      | or you could, and I have done this for a few people, especially some group chats in iMessage,        |
| 34:14      | I've got it where there's actually ask for input box, and then I use the send message                |
| 34:20      | action, but I've toggled off show when sending, which means it sends in the background, and          |
| 34:26      | I don't ever have to actually open the chat, which for some really busy chats, where it's            |
| 34:30      | very easy to get distracted by pictures of cute bunnies or something, it's good to help              |
| 34:34      | me keep focused if it's just that I want to send a message that I'm running late for                 |
| 34:37      | dinner.                                                                                              |
| 34:38      | Yeah, I played with that and it's really goofy.                                                      |
| 34:40      | One of the things I think they made a mistake with with Siri Shortcuts is when they give             |
| 34:45      | you the example donations, when you tap on it, they always suggest that you create shortcut          |
| 34:51      | with telling a person the exact phrase, you just texted them, like if I text Rose, hey,              |
| 34:58      | let's start five minutes early, and say, do you want to create a Siri Shortcut?                      |
| 35:02      | Telling Rose Mary Orchard five minutes early, no, that's a one time thing.                           |
| 35:07      | I feel like they could do a better job with those donations, but the reason I really didn't          |
| 35:11      | ever get into going deeper on that communications tab is because I use all that stuff for [[Drafts]].    |
| 35:16      | I mean, I write most of it in [[Drafts]], and then with [[Drafts]], I've already got the send                |
| 35:20      | to Rose, send to family groups into the, you know, all my usual suspects are already included        |
| 35:26      | in automation on [[Drafts]].                                                                         |
| 35:28      | Yeah, I mean, that would probably should do something on [[Drafts]].                                     |
| 35:32      | I don't think we need to give that probably a show at some point, at least a show.                   |
| 35:36      | There's a lot to cover there.                                                                        |
| 35:37      | Yes, there is, there are a few good things that I donated to messages, though, for example,          |
| 35:44      | as well as I have one saying send I know exclamation mark to my mom, it has the option to just send  |
| 35:51      | a message or send a message to mom.                                                                  |
| 35:53      | And if I run send a message to mom, then it will just open messages to my mom specifically,          |
| 36:00      | which is exactly what I was looking for there.                                                       |
| 36:03      | And then that's it.                                                                                  |
| 36:04      | That's the end of the shortcut.                                                                      |
| 36:06      | So that's pretty nice.                                                                               |
| 36:07      | Of course, using [[Drafts]] for this is great.                                                           |
| 36:10      | But sometimes I just need to check what the person said before applying to them.                     |
| 36:14      | And that's unfortunately where it's a little more difficult to use [[Drafts]] because then               |
| 36:18      | I have to open messages or WhatsApp or [[Skype]] or whatever communication method it is we're            |
| 36:23      | using probably smoke signals by now.                                                                 |
| 36:26      | And then check it.                                                                                   |
| 36:27      | And then I go to [[Drafts]] and I write it only to send it back to the application I just                |
| 36:30      | came from.                                                                                           |
| 36:31      | That's the case where [[Drafts]], unfortunately, does not make sense there.                              |
| 36:34      | Yeah, but I mean, one of the other things I really want to emphasise on this is that                 |
| 36:38      | really lets you expose the apps that you normally are digging on other screens or in folders         |
| 36:43      | for.                                                                                                 |
| 36:45      | I like to play my saxophone.                                                                         |
| 36:47      | It's a weird thing, but I do it.                                                                     |
| 36:48      | But I've got these apps.                                                                             |
| 36:49      | I've got one for tuning, you know, just to make sure I'm playing in tune.                            |
| 36:53      | I've got one called for score that plays that displays my music.                                     |
| 36:56      | I've got one that is a little robotic drummer that plays, you know, it plays a beat because          |
| 37:02      | you want to get your rhythm right.                                                                   |
| 37:04      | You want to have it's almost like a metronome, but it's got a swing beat or something.               |
| 37:08      | But you know, I have to go dig for those apps all the time.                                          |
| 37:10      | So I made one of these shortcuts based on that.                                                      |
| 37:13      | And then I've actually got a bigger shortcut just called play.                                       |
| 37:17      | And that one launches a whole bunch of stuff.                                                        |
| 37:19      | It gets me into the Apple store.                                                                     |
| 37:21      | It gets me on Amazon.                                                                                |
| 37:22      | It gets me on the HBO app opens the [[Apple TV App\|TV app]].                                                          |
| 37:25      | But there's also a button there called saxophone, which exposes that second level of those saxophone |
| 37:30      | apps.                                                                                                |
| 37:31      | So it's just a couple of taps I can get to exactly the apps I need.                                  |
| 37:34      | And by doing this, I find I use the folders a lot less frequently.                                   |
| 37:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 37:39      | I have started replacing a large chunk of my folders with shortcuts because it allows                |
| 37:44      | me to either open apps to the specific area that I always go to anyway, or just hide the             |
| 37:52      | ones that I never use, but have some kind of feature like sending me a notification because          |
| 37:56      | I need that.                                                                                         |
| 37:57      | For example, the app from my credit card company is dire and I rarely open it, but I do like         |
| 38:02      | the notifications I get when I use my card just to make sure that everything's working               |
| 38:07      | as it should do.                                                                                     |
| 38:08      | And if I get a notification when I haven't used my card, then I'm aware, which is always             |
| 38:12      | useful.                                                                                              |
| 38:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 38:14      | Another one that's just like makes sense as a shortcut, but it's actually difficult                  |
| 38:18      | to manage.                                                                                           |
| 38:19      | Otherwise, as I have a collection of health related, I've got one that opens the activity            |
| 38:23      | app, I've got one that, you know, when I'm going to start a workout, the things I do,                |
| 38:27      | I've got one for my meditation, I've got one for tracking food to the start walk.                    |
| 38:33      | When I was mentioning earlier, that one's also referenced here at like one of the messages           |
| 38:37      | I like you to take out of this listening to the show is you can use these shortcuts once             |
| 38:41      | you make them in repeated locations, you know, the start walk one shows up in a couple places        |
| 38:47      | for me.                                                                                              |
| 38:48      | The timer one show up all over the place and I just save it as a single or very short                |
| 38:52      | action shortcut, but then I just access it and run it from other locations, you know,                |
| 38:58      | you can go beyond the box here, you know, let your mind expand as you start thinking                 |
| 39:03      | about the ways to implement these.                                                                   |
| 39:05      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 39:06      | And I would actually definitely recommend in the vast majority of cases, if it's more                |
| 39:10      | than one action, make it into its own shortcut and then you can include it in other places           |
| 39:14      | because a very long shortcut can be difficult to manage and look at.                                 |
| 39:18      | And also if you then decide, for example, you have the start walk one, okay, so you                  |
| 39:23      | put that in one shortcut, maybe you want to access it in this other one as well.                     |
| 39:26      | Now what do you do?                                                                                  |
| 39:27      | Do you go copy the actions over and then you decide actually when you go for a walk, you             |
| 39:31      | also want to turn off all the lights in the house before you leave.                                  |
| 39:35      | You have to modify it in two places by turning it into its own shortcut, then you modify             |
| 39:39      | it once and it's updated everywhere.                                                                 |
| 39:41      | This is a function in programming terms and it is extremely useful for everybody and it              |
| 39:46      | also means that you can search for things and, you know, find it later and run it independently      |
| 39:51      | if you want.                                                                                         |
| 39:52      | And also more importantly, you can run it via Siri if you want because if it's an individual         |
| 39:57      | shortcut, you can donate it to Siri very easily versus donating a much larger shortcut               |
| 40:01      | with a menu.                                                                                         |
| 40:03      | Siri has some value, but perhaps not as much as an individual one.                                   |
| 40:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 40:08      | There's just so much you can do with this.                                                           |
| 40:10      | I was looking, I have a travel one where it's got things like open Google Maps and open              |
| 40:15      | Maps, but it's also got ones that get specific directions or get me where I'm at or it's             |
| 40:21      | got the single button, you know, send Daisy my location when I'm out, you know, in the               |
| 40:26      | world and I want her to know where I'm at.                                                           |
| 40:29      | It's just got a bunch of stuff related to location, but also it's got stuff in here                  |
| 40:34      | how to find a restaurant.                                                                            |
| 40:35      | So you get to combine all this stuff under one button and I guess going back on the theme            |
| 40:41      | Rose said earlier, when you've got it right in front of your face, when you push that                |
| 40:44      | button, you're more likely to use these tools.                                                       |
| 40:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 40:47      | Definitely.                                                                                          |
| 40:48      | And it's a great way of actually making sure you do things.                                          |
| 40:51      | So recently I've been beta testing a few different applications, which theoretically will replace    |
| 40:56      | other applications in my daily workflow.                                                             |
| 40:58      | And because I've been using the shortcuts, it's really easy because I've literally opened            |
| 41:01      | up the shortcut to edit it and changed, for example, I'm beta testing a micro blog app.              |
| 41:06      | I've changed the micro blog app out to be this other one.                                            |
| 41:11      | And that's great because then I still do exactly the same action, but I actually get to base         |
| 41:15      | test this application for these people because, you know, I said that I would give some feedback     |
| 41:19      | and if I don't use it, I can't provide feedback.                                                     |
| 41:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 41:22      | Just like on my audio list of my audio series shortcut launcher, I've got an entry called            |
| 41:27      | podcast, but it doesn't open the [[Apple Podcasts\| Apple podcast app]].                             |
| 41:31      | It opens overcast, but maybe next week I'm trying a different app.                                   |
| 41:34      | I can swap that out and the button I push never changes and the label never changes.                 |
| 41:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 41:40      | So back to something I said earlier as well.                                                         |
| 41:43      | If you have a relative with an iPad or an iPhone that's, you know, and maybe you have                |
| 41:47      | to change an application because they complain that it's not working, but having them remember       |
| 41:51      | the name of the new application, if you've done, if you've actually put shortcuts on                 |
| 41:55      | their screen for them, then they have the same icon and they have the same name for                  |
| 41:59      | the icon and they press it and it just opens the different application.                              |
| 42:03      | This is a little bit like what I used to do for my grandparents with putting Chrome on               |
| 42:07      | the desktop with the Internet Explorer icon because the blue E is the internet.                      |
| 42:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 42:12      | That's clever.                                                                                       |
| 42:13      | I like that.                                                                                         |
| 42:14      | I'm sure a lot of nerds have done that before.                                                       |
| 42:16      | This is a very similar concept or could be.                                                          |
| 42:18      | And this can both be to trick you into doing something that you want to do or not.                   |
| 42:24      | And of course, don't forget, you could have it as well.                                              |
| 42:26      | Just check the time.                                                                                 |
| 42:27      | And if you try and open Twitter past 10 p.m., it's like, nope, go to bed.                            |
| 42:32      | Do all sorts of things.                                                                              |
| 42:33      | Let's talk a little bit about this customisation because when I did that video, a bunch of           |
| 42:37      | people asked me, well, how did you get those icons on your screen and how come they don't            |
| 42:41      | have labels on them?                                                                                 |
| 42:43      | And let's just talk about the mechanics of that a little bit.                                        |
| 42:46      | So there's a lot of things that you can do here.                                                     |
| 42:47      | The first of all, obviously, is give your shortcut an icon.                                          |
| 42:53      | So you choose the colour in shortcuts and you choose which glyph represents it.                      |
| 42:59      | And then you can also, in the shortcut, so this is in the settings in the top right,                 |
| 43:05      | it's an often an on toggle under the dumb button.                                                    |
| 43:09      | And then you tap on icon.                                                                            |
| 43:10      | You can also say home screen and you can select photo or take a photo, which means that you          |
| 43:15      | can, if you want to go super crazy and make custom artwork, or you can just take an existing         |
| 43:21      | logo like the Automators logo and put that in there as well.                                         |
| 43:25      | The names, all apps and folders have names they're required to on iOS, which is something            |
| 43:32      | that I would, you know, I'm joining the course of people would say, I'd like to be able to           |
| 43:35      | turn that off.                                                                                       |
| 43:36      | I mean, just think about the apps on your home screen.                                               |
| 43:39      | When's the last time you needed to read the name of any of them?                                     |
| 43:42      | Yeah, I mean, yeah, once you've had an app for a few weeks, you remember what the icon               |
| 43:47      | looks like and it's mostly muscle memory for a lot of us, I'm sure, or you're launching              |
| 43:52      | it via Siri anyway, so you don't care what name it says.                                             |
| 43:56      | I would almost say once you've had it for a few hours, you know what the icon does.                  |
| 44:00      | But the anyway, but that's required.                                                                 |
| 44:02      | But there are some ASCII characters that are blank and it's like the secret, you know,               |
| 44:08      | the secret password, you've got to get them.                                                         |
| 44:10      | I got them off the internet years ago and I just saved them to a file where I just copy              |
| 44:15      | and paste them because you can't like put, you have to put something in for the name                 |
| 44:20      | or it won't let you complete the creation of the icon.                                               |
| 44:23      | But so you just paste in these blank characters and we'll put them in the link to the show.          |
| 44:28      | As a fact, I was thinking, maybe I'll even make a Siri shortcut that just paste those                |
| 44:32      | blank characters into the clipboard and then you could paste it.                                     |
| 44:36      | I'll have to figure it out, but I either way, we'll make those accessible to you so you              |
| 44:40      | can paste them in and that gives you an icon without a name underneath it and it looks               |
| 44:45      | really cool, I think.                                                                                |
| 44:47      | The other thing, I'm not sure how great it is, but he made the top line blank and I                  |
| 44:53      | think he did mention he used shortcuts.                                                              |
| 44:54      | So what we do is you make a shortcut and then you just give it an icon that is a solid black.        |
| 45:00      | If you've got a black background, then it's just going to blend right in.                            |
| 45:03      | So like he had his list of icons starting on the second row on the top row, there were               |
| 45:09      | four shortcuts up there that just had a solid black icon with node label and then that in            |
| 45:14      | essence pushed everything down a row.                                                                |
| 45:17      | And on that episode, Mike made the recommendation, which I think is brilliant, is to have secret     |
| 45:22      | shortcuts attached to those icons that you can't see, like maybe you make an OmniFocus               |
| 45:27      | new inbox item up there where it looks like there's no icon, but you just tap up there               |
| 45:32      | and it opens up for you like magic.                                                                  |
| 45:35      | And I've thought about that, but I've never gone to the level of doing it.                           |
| 45:40      | For me, when I've created those blank icons, they're just shortcuts that have no commands            |
| 45:44      | in them at this point for me.                                                                        |
| 45:46      | Have you done, have you played with that?                                                            |
| 45:48      | I briefly tried it and realised that I like having lots of icons on my home screen.                  |
| 45:54      | So it's not for me.                                                                                  |
| 45:55      | I can see for some people, especially if you don't have many icons and you want to have              |
| 46:00      | a very minimalist iPhone home screen, then that would be a really great way to push the              |
| 46:05      | most frequently used icons down underneath your thumb and to say the bottom two rows,                |
| 46:10      | which tend to be the most accessible ones.                                                           |
| 46:12      | But I tend to put things that I'm trying to do less of, but I still need to do in the                |
| 46:18      | top row.                                                                                             |
| 46:19      | One of the things we haven't mentioned about this is every time you run one of these, unfortunately, |
| 46:26      | when you run it from your home screen, it's going to jump into the Siri Shortcuts app.               |
| 46:31      | It's a little bit jarring the way it happens.                                                        |
| 46:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 46:36      | Unfortunately, it actually sends you to [[Safari]] and then it opens the Shortcuts app, which            |
| 46:40      | is a little bit, yeah, it takes a moment of getting used to it, but there's a great                  |
| 46:46      | tip where it says, if you turn off reduce motion, then the action becomes more fluid.                |
| 46:51      | Of course, this may change how other things appear.                                                  |
| 46:53      | In my case, it breaks my iPhone background because I have a black background with a rainbow          |
| 46:56      | border, which is just a thin, I think one or two pixel line around my phone.                         |
| 47:01      | And that breaks, unfortunately, if I turn off reduce motion.                                         |
| 47:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:05      | Either way, I really don't like that.                                                                |
| 47:08      | I mean, I know it just takes a few seconds, but I'm just not a fan of that action.                   |
| 47:14      | I wish that, or maybe, hopefully, with a future version of Siri Shortcuts, it won't drag you         |
| 47:20      | through that process.                                                                                |
| 47:22      | Interestingly, an alternative, and what I've been using is you can put these things on               |
| 47:28      | your widget screen, too, how the widget screen has a Siri Shortcuts widget.                          |
| 47:33      | If you put that on there and you're judicious in the way you set up your widget screen,              |
| 47:39      | you can select in the Siri Shortcuts app, which applications get on your widget screen,              |
| 47:44      | you can have all of these available to you by just swiping to the left on the widget                 |
| 47:48      | screen and tapping on the appropriate one.                                                           |
| 47:50      | And in that case, it doesn't go to [[Safari]], it doesn't go to the Siri Shortcuts app.                  |
| 47:53      | It truly acts like a menu-driven system, way more clean that way if you're unhappy with              |
| 48:00      | the icons.                                                                                           |
| 48:01      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 48:02      | And I can actually give people an additional tip, or I thought I could, and now I can't              |
| 48:05      | anymore because where is it?                                                                         |
| 48:08      | If you do the modifying of the widget in Shortcuts itself, so if you tap on the settings, then       |
| 48:17      | there should be Show in Widgets, so you can make sure whether or not your actual shortcut            |
| 48:22      | is showing in the widgets.                                                                           |
| 48:24      | And there should be somewhere in Shortcuts the option to go into the settings for Shortcuts,         |
| 48:29      | and then you can modify the widget screen and you can just move things up and down in there,         |
| 48:32      | which gets them to the top of your widgets much more easily.                                         |
| 48:35      | That's a good one.                                                                                   |
| 48:36      | Also, you can use the Launcher app to help you along with this as well.                              |
| 48:41      | So I use Launcher because it can show me widgets, I believe it has six or eight different widgets,   |
| 48:47      | and it can show me widgets based on time or location.                                                |
| 48:50      | So when I'm outside of Vienna, it can show me my travel one, but when I'm inside of Austria,         |
| 48:55      | it can show me my Austria slash Vienna one.                                                          |
| 48:58      | When I'm at work, it will show me my work one, which means that the Shortcuts and other              |
| 49:02      | actions that I would do at work, for example, are right there with one swipe when I'm at             |
| 49:07      | work, but once I leave work, they're not there anymore, which is useful for focus.                   |
| 49:12      | I don't know.                                                                                        |
| 49:13      | Do you think we could do a whole show on Launcher?                                                   |
| 49:15      | I almost think we could.                                                                             |
| 49:17      | I think so.                                                                                          |
| 49:18      | I mean, we're going to have to do a show on Launch Center Pro because that is in beta                |
| 49:21      | testing for 3.0.                                                                                     |
| 49:22      | I am under an NDA, unfortunately, but I will say it's awesome.                                       |
| 49:27      | So we're going to be doing a show on that.                                                           |
| 49:28      | Agreed.                                                                                              |
| 49:29      | That is a show.                                                                                      |
| 49:31      | Yeah, they are separate applications.                                                                |
| 49:33      | Just to be clear, Launch Center Pro, I believe was first on the market, and it's one of              |
| 49:37      | my favourite applications.                                                                           |
| 49:39      | It was one of the first automation apps for iOS.                                                     |
| 49:42      | Am I breaking the NDA if I say the beta is in my dock right now?                                     |
| 49:46      | I don't think so.                                                                                    |
| 49:47      | No, I don't think either was a breaking beta by saying it's in our dock because it is.               |
| 49:53      | What's in your dock these days, Russ?                                                                |
| 49:55      | Currently, I have [[Drafts]], [[Safari]], Launch Center Pro, and OmniFocus.                                  |
| 49:59      | How about you?                                                                                       |
| 50:00      | I have OmniFocus, [[Drafts]], and Launch Center Pro, and just those three.                               |
| 50:05      | I keep trying three in the dock, but I use [[Safari]] a lot because I Google so much.                    |
| 50:11      | So maybe I need to put a shortcut in my dock to Google Things instead of opening [[Safari]].             |
| 50:16      | Well, actually, and I kind of misspoke, it's not actually OmniFocus.                                 |
| 50:20      | It's OmniSelect.                                                                                     |
| 50:21      | It's my shortcut we've been talking about because I like to just, I love the idea of                 |
| 50:26      | just going straight to the part of the, especially on a big app like OmniFocus.                      |
| 50:31      | I don't have to navigate anything, I just press a button, it takes me where I want                   |
| 50:34      | to go.                                                                                               |
| 50:35      | Yeah, that's good.                                                                                   |
| 50:36      | I still have OmniFocus there because it's useful to have the badge on the icon, and this             |
| 50:41      | is something that you won't get with shortcuts, which may be something that you want or maybe        |
| 50:45      | something you don't want.                                                                            |
| 50:46      | You do not get a badge on a shortcut.                                                                |
| 50:50      | Even if it is a shortcut just to open a specific application, you will not get a badge.              |
| 50:54      | That shortcut can give you notifications as part of this, and this is something I didn't             |
| 50:59      | mentioned earlier, but some applications like, for example, Quip, I use for more than one            |
| 51:04      | purpose and they, unfortunately, are not shortcut-successful, which means that all I can do is open  |
| 51:09      | the app.                                                                                             |
| 51:10      | So what I do is I have a notification that pops up after opening the app, and then I                 |
| 51:16      | get the app and I'm in the app and I'm going, oh, rabbit hole, rabbit hole, and the notification     |
| 51:20      | slides in from the top to show me, you are going to look at the automators outline.                  |
| 51:25      | Ah, right.                                                                                           |
| 51:26      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 51:27      | Thank you very much.                                                                                 |
| 51:28      | Pass to me.                                                                                          |
| 51:29      | That's good.                                                                                         |
| 51:30      | That's good.                                                                                         |
| 51:31      | That's not the only...                                                                               |
| 51:32      | Some apps just are not available, like the camera app, for instance, which is super frustrating.     |
| 51:37      | I've got a whole camera shortcut system, but the actual camera app isn't in it because               |
| 51:41      | it's not available to me.                                                                            |
| 51:43      | No, but you can, thankfully, at the very least, take a photo, which, yeah, it's a start.             |
| 51:49      | It's not quite what you want, and you have to specify how many photos you want to take               |
| 51:54      | and which camera you want to take it with the front camera or the back camera and whether            |
| 51:57      | or not you want to show a camera preview and all of that stuff.                                      |
| 52:01      | It is odd that some of the Apple apps are the ones that are not Siri shortcut-friendly.              |
| 52:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 52:06      | But then again...                                                                                    |
| 52:07      | It's also weird that you can turn off showing a camera preview because if you do that, then          |
| 52:13      | it just takes a photo of whatever is in front of whichever camera it is.                             |
| 52:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 52:17      | Kind of creepy.                                                                                      |
| 52:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 52:19      | But you don't have to press the buttons, take the photo, so that's something.                        |
| 52:25      | So you can't do everything with Siri shortcuts, but you can do a lot, and this is something          |
| 52:30      | I think you should try.                                                                              |
| 52:31      | You should not do it the way I did it because I fell into a hole for like a day and a half           |
| 52:35      | setting these things up.                                                                             |
| 52:38      | I think it's better, you know, just build them as you need them, but I do find that it's             |
| 52:42      | very useful.                                                                                         |
| 52:43      | I haven't decided yet where I fall on this, whether I'm going to just run them from the              |
| 52:48      | widget screen and just keep apps on my home screen, or right now I've got a kind of a combination    |
| 52:54      | of everything.                                                                                       |
| 52:55      | Like I said, I've got Omni Select in my dock, I've got the, especially the legal and the             |
| 52:58      | MacSparky contextual shortcuts are so useful to me.                                                  |
| 53:02      | I just keep those on my home screen, but some of them I have just got apps.                          |
| 53:07      | I just haven't really figured out how it all plays out for me yet.                                   |
| 53:11      | That whole thing jumping to [[Safari]] and then back to Siri shortcuts really just makes me              |
| 53:15      | crazy sometimes.                                                                                     |
| 53:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 53:17      | But I mean, at the same time for everybody listening, remember that there are no rules               |
| 53:20      | to this.                                                                                             |
| 53:21      | Do whatever you think works.                                                                         |
| 53:22      | And if this doesn't work, then well, I mean, at the very least you play with shortcuts               |
| 53:25      | some more, which is always a fun, fun exercise and it's well worth doing, I would say.               |
| 53:31      | But honestly, it's going to work because it's faster.                                                |
| 53:35      | It just is faster.                                                                                   |
| 53:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 53:37      | I mean, there's only so many slots on your home screen and the idea that not only can                |
| 53:41      | you open an app, but you can start a specific task in an app that always would take more             |
| 53:46      | clicks and button presses once you got the app open.                                                 |
| 53:50      | It's just faster.                                                                                    |
| 53:51      | And I suspect even it tries, this is going to adopt at least some portion of it.                     |
| 53:57      | And I mean, sometimes you can do some of these things with force touching an app icon, but           |
| 54:02      | I don't know about you, but I always forget that I can force touch app icons until I do              |
| 54:06      | it accidentally.                                                                                     |
| 54:07      | And there's like, oh, right.                                                                         |
| 54:08      | Yeah, I could do that because you get the little widget and then you get the things.                 |
| 54:12      | But of course, this is also an accessibility trick.                                                  |
| 54:15      | If you're somebody that for one reason or another can't force touch, then you can actually           |
| 54:19      | replicate those force touch options with shortcuts in the vast majority of cases and even go         |
| 54:27      | further.                                                                                             |
| 54:28      | Yeah, but I mean, the difference is though, it's just this is so much more customisable              |
| 54:32      | to you.                                                                                              |
| 54:33      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 54:34      | Force touching OmniFocus lets me create a new inbox item.                                            |
| 54:37      | It does not let me create a new idea for a blog post with everything already filled out              |
| 54:42      | for me or a new, you know, question for a client or, you know, that's not the only                   |
| 54:46      | I have a lot of customised inbox items that I've made with this because there's a bunch              |
| 54:51      | of stuff I do all the time that always has the same tags and always has the same projects.           |
| 54:55      | So why not just automate that stuff?                                                                 |
| 54:57      | So I only have to type in the least amount of information and get it captured properly.              |
| 55:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:04      | And I mean, I've been doing that too, and especially once you add the ability to do                  |
| 55:07      | multiple steps.                                                                                      |
| 55:08      | So for example, the new blog post thing can also create a blog post draft in [[Drafts]] for              |
| 55:14      | you.                                                                                                 |
| 55:15      | And then you can actually save a link to that in the note of the OmniFocus task.                     |
| 55:20      | And then, you know, you just saved yourself five minutes later because then you're looking           |
| 55:24      | at draft and it's like, oh yeah, that was that was the post I wanted to write and then               |
| 55:27      | done.                                                                                                |
| 55:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:29      | And you can like even go crazy and say, open up, create the task in the appropriate Ulysses          |
| 55:35      | folder and calendar time to write the blog post and create a calendar entry for posting              |
| 55:42      | it next week.                                                                                        |
| 55:43      | You know, you can you can go really far down the rabbit hole on this stuff.                          |
| 55:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:48      | That's where it gets really powerful.                                                                |
| 55:50      | I think we both have been eager to do this show because we've been having so much fun                |
| 55:54      | with it.                                                                                             |
| 55:55      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 55:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:58      | No, we have.                                                                                         |
| 55:59      | It's been something I've been playing with for quite a while and I'm really enjoying                 |
| 56:01      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 56:02      | Yeah, my thanks to Gray for kind of leaving, blazing the trail here.                                 |
| 56:06      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 56:07      | And we did ask him, unfortunately, he wasn't able to be on today's show, but and he did              |
| 56:12      | send me a comment that he wanted to include, which is shortcut launches to launch shortcuts          |
| 56:16      | adjust the best.                                                                                     |
| 56:18      | So I think I can leave you with that message.                                                        |
| 56:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 56:22      | Can you tell this is fun?                                                                            |
| 56:23      | I think it is.                                                                                       |
| 56:24      | If you're listening to our show, this is fun for you.                                                |
| 56:26      | So give it a try and share them with us over at talk.automators.com.                                 |
| 56:32      | FM.                                                                                                  |
| 56:33      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 56:34      | And as always, there will be a thread for every episode, but feel free to create your                |
| 56:37      | own threads as well.                                                                                 |
| 56:38      | If it's related to the episode, then maybe just post a link to that in the thread for                |
| 56:44      | the episode as well, which is we're going to have some screencasts with this one to                  |
| 56:48      | show you, you know, how we're doing some of this stuff.                                              |
| 56:50      | So if you're confused by some of it, just follow along.                                              |
| 56:53      | Like Rose said, we'll have a simple one, we'll have a complex one.                                   |
| 56:57      | But I don't think this, this stuff is not particularly difficult and it's super useful.              |
| 57:02      | Yes, it is.                                                                                          |
| 57:04      | It's very easy to grasp.                                                                             |
| 57:06      | It's a great way to exercise your shortcut skills, especially if you're getting to grips             |
| 57:10      | with it and you can reach the sky and go beyond.                                                     |
| 57:14      | I'm sure somebody someday will figure out how to take us to the moon with shortcuts.                 |
| 57:18      | Amen.                                                                                                |
| 57:19      | All right.                                                                                           |

| 57:39      | Don't forget there is a blog post which accompanies every episode.                                   |
| 57:42      | And if you want a blog, a RSS feed of just the automators blog posts, then you can get               |
| 57:48      | that over at automators.fm, which will then take from either my blog or David's blog depending       |
| 57:55      | on who is in charge of which episode.                                                                |

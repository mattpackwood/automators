# Show Notes
Get out your artistically crafted paper notebook and favourite fountain pen as we talk about journalling in [Automators episode 14](https://www.relay.fm/automators/14). Actually, forget that stuff. Our intrepid hosts are nerds so while the focus of this episode is journalling, it's really about automating the process so you can get more efficient at your navel-gazing.

## Much Love for Day One
Rose and David start out talking about the idea of journalling and why automation can help. The first app they recommend is [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com).  
Last year David bought a year subscription to Day One, and he's digging it. Both David and Rose approve of Day One's Automation tools with things like [IFTTT](https://IFTTTtt.com/discover) along with several built-in features (like the [activity feed](http://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/activity-feed)) that ease the process of journal entry creation so you can focus on your precious words. Day One can integrate with third-party apps, like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) and [Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com). David also feels inferior about the way he says the word "banana".

Day One is friends with [Siri Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055) which opens you up to lots of potential automation, although David would like more. This leads to the discussion of automating Day One entries in a "prompt style" with a new journal entry generated out of Siri Shortcuts and used to create a Day One entry. David created a sample shortcut and [screencasted it for this episode](https://youtu.be/oa82IYJ_fMY) on a meditation journal. You can watch it in the Automators course at [learn.macsparky](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/automators-bonus-content) or on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/oa82IYJ_fMY).

Rosemary goes a step further by using [Launch Center Pro](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=launch+centre+pro&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) to launch her Siri Shortcut to launch her journalling prompts. This lets her present different prompts on different days of the week. Clever. We've shared a link to Rose's shortcut in the show notes.

David explains audio transcription in Day One, that works much better than you think it would be.

If This Then That (IFTTT) can also create a Day One entry, pulling data from other web services. Think about that one for a moment. Simple things, like a Google Calendar event, can be enough to trigger a new Day One entry. Rose has a cool automation that helps her log and journal television consumption using automation between [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) and Day One.

Another way to automate journal creation is through text automation. You could use tools like [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) or [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com) to give you prompts to easily create journal entries.

## Other Options
Then our hosts talk about journalling solutions outside of Day One. Using third-party applications like [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) or even just a plain text file, you can use many of the above referenced prompt-based journal automation to create new entries. There can be some challenges with things like photos and other media, but it can work. David even at one point suggests using [Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/), which would work better than you think if you want media in your journal. 

Next, our hosts discuss automating public journals with services like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog).

## Fancy Pens and Paper
Finally, David breaks out the pens and paper. Just because you have a fancy pen and paper, doesn't mean you can't bring some technology to the table. Use [ScanBot](https://scanbot.io/en/index.html) or [Scanner Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro/id333710667?mt=8) to grab an image for a digital backup. If you like the idea of us a pen but not paper, there are some great iPad-based digital alternatives like [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) and [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com).

It's January and a great time to develop a journalling habit. Why don't you use some automation to make it easier?

| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David, and I'm joined by my co-host, Rose Orchard, and this is Automators, where         |
| 00:06      | we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.                              |
| 00:09      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                        |
| 00:10      | Hello, David.                                                                                       |
| 00:11      | You know, the New Year's here, and why can't we talk about journalling on automators?                |
| 00:19      | There is no Relay FM ban on discussing journalling.                                                 |
| 00:24      | You are allowed to talk about note-taking applications that is allowed.                             |
| 00:28      | So I don't see why we're not allowed to talk about it, so let's do journalling today.                |
| 00:32      | Yeah, we're unhinged.                                                                               |
| 00:33      | Last January, I decided to do an experiment.                                                        |
| 00:37      | I signed up for a year subscription with [[Day One]], and I really took to that, and I find             |
| 00:43      | that keeping a journal every day helps me keep sane and gives me all the good feels,                |
| 00:49      | so it was an experiment that worked for me.                                                         |
| 00:52      | But having done it for a year, I've added some automation, and I thought it would be                |
| 00:55      | fun to talk about that a little bit, because I know there's a lot of people interested              |
| 00:58      | in journalling, and if you're doing digital journalling in particular, but I've even got              |
| 01:03      | some ideas in this outline, if you're doing paper journalling, that you can bring the digital        |
| 01:07      | bits into it and automate that, so it's not quite so tedious.                                       |
| 01:12      | Yes, because I think a lot of people think of journalling as like, you sit down and you              |
| 01:17      | spend like 20 minutes to an hour doing Deer Diary today.                                            |
| 01:21      | For breakfast, I had a banana and cereal, and journalling can be so much more than that,             |
| 01:25      | and it doesn't have to be this massive chunk of time, and especially if you add a little            |
| 01:30      | automation to it, you can really speed it up, and all you have to do is maybe write a sentence      |
| 01:34      | or two, and you've got a really nice log of your day, and you can look back at it, and              |
| 01:40      | you've got all of this data, all of these photos collected in one place for you, which              |
| 01:45      | can be end-to-end encrypted as well if you're using something like [[Day One]], or stored in            |
| 01:49      | whatever format you like, and pretty much everything else, so there's a lot of advantages           |
| 01:55      | to doing this.                                                                                      |
| 01:56      | Yeah, you don't need to get a fancy pen and an expensive notebook and a pipe to do this.            |
| 02:02      | We're going to give you options here that you can do with the tools on your devices                 |
| 02:06      | right now.                                                                                          |
| 02:07      | I mean, this could be as simple as a text file.                                                     |
| 02:08      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 02:09      | Hey, Rose, before we get started, you and I are going to be together in Seattle in January.         |
| 02:14      | Yes, it is January, and this podcast goes out, and just over two weeks later, PodCon                |
| 02:20      | is happening on January 19th and 20th, and we're both going to be there, which is exciting.         |
| 02:25      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 02:26      | So we were thinking about maybe doing some kind of automators meetup.                               |
| 02:29      | We haven't got any plans as we record this, but we will.                                            |
| 02:33      | So if you're interested, go to talk.automators.fm, we'll have a post in there, and probably         |
| 02:40      | the evening of Saturday the 19th, we're going to try and do something.                              |
| 02:44      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 02:45      | If there is anything, I can guarantee there will be stickers at the very least, and that            |
| 02:49      | both David and I will be present.                                                                   |
| 02:51      | So that is always good.                                                                             |
| 02:53      | And if you are from Seattle or the Seattle area and you can make any recommendations,               |
| 02:57      | then please hop into the thread and let us know what you would recommend if we don't                |
| 03:01      | have a location by then.                                                                            |
| 03:04      | And also, if you are going to come, please let us know.                                             |
| 03:09      | It's always nice to hear from people who are planning on coming just so we can get a rough          |
| 03:12      | idea of numbers so that we know if we need a table for two or a table for 20.                       |
| 03:17      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 03:18      | See you then.                                                                                       |
| 03:19      | Let's start with the, I think for automation-friendly, the easiest way to do this involves spending |
| 03:26      | a little bit of money, and I think [[Day One]] is an application I would highly recommend               |
| 03:30      | if you wanted to get a journalling habit started.                                                    |
| 03:33      | This is not a commercial or a paid sponsorship or anything, but it is the app that really,          |
| 03:38      | I think is just a great solution for this day, it allows you to keep multiple journals.             |
| 03:43      | So like if you wanted to keep one for work-related stuff and one for personal, I even have one      |
| 03:48      | for thankfulness, just a thankfulness journal in there.                                             |
| 03:51      | So I think I actually have six different journals I've created inside [[Day One]] over the over         |
| 03:55      | the year that I've been using it regularly.                                                         |
| 03:58      | And it's just a great app because it keeps everything for you if you use their service,             |
| 04:03      | it's encrypted and you got the ability to export them out to an actual book if you want and         |
| 04:09      | all sorts of cool stuff.                                                                            |
| 04:11      | But the piece of [[Day One]] I'd like to focus on for this episode is the automation piece.             |
| 04:20      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 04:21      | And this is where [[Day One]] is ahead of the crowd in many respects because they have this and         |
| 04:27      | that integration.                                                                                   |
| 04:28      | There's integration directly into shortcuts with actions that were there from when this             |
| 04:33      | was workflow.                                                                                       |
| 04:35      | And that is extremely useful if you want to do this kind of automation because finding              |
| 04:41      | something else that is integrated with if this and that, you're probably going to be                |
| 04:45      | looking at files in [[Dropbox]] and maybe [[Hazel]] on the back end to do some extra organisation           |
| 04:50      | for you or something.                                                                               |
| 04:52      | And that is not as much fun as something that does a chunk of the work for you already,             |
| 04:58      | which is something we always like, the point of this podcast is to do less work, not to             |
| 05:03      | do more work.                                                                                       |
| 05:04      | I'm sure all of us spent plenty of time playing with these automations, which is always good        |
| 05:09      | for you.                                                                                            |
| 05:10      | And I do think that if you want to automate a journal, there are pieces of it that are              |
| 05:17      | definitely amenable to automation.                                                                  |
| 05:20      | And [[Day One]] has a feature called activity feed, which I think is a great way to get                 |
| 05:26      | started from the activity feed.                                                                     |
| 05:27      | You can grab information like your most recently shot photos, if you've got an [[Instagram]] feed,      |
| 05:35      | it can attach to that.                                                                              |
| 05:37      | I believe it's a, you know, I just close the app.                                                   |
| 05:42      | There's also a Foursquare, if you've got a Foursquare, I mean, who does Foursquare                  |
| 05:45      | anymore, Rose?                                                                                      |
| 05:46      | I'm not sure.                                                                                       |
| 05:47      | Well, it's now called Swarm, I think, and I've actually used that.                                  |
| 05:51      | And I know a lot of people who are indie web people are using this because there's a great          |
| 05:55      | service which will get you later where you can then put this stuff on your own blog,                |
| 05:59      | which is nice.                                                                                      |
| 06:00      | And so if you're using it, I mean, the advantage of using something like Foursquare or Swarm,       |
| 06:05      | this is an automation trick, use it, because then when you check in, it just grabs that             |
| 06:09      | data for you and that just goes straight into [[Day One]].                                              |
| 06:12      | And then you don't have to like open [[Day One]] and type currently at XYZ restaurant with              |
| 06:17      | A, B, and C, eating bananas, apparently we're having a banana theme today, and you can just         |
| 06:25      | type the status.                                                                                    |
| 06:26      | You say banana with so much more class than I do, I feel like I'm, I don't know, I feel             |
| 06:31      | like I'm second class here, definitely.                                                             |
| 06:34      | You are not second class, David, you are first class, but yeah, that's why connecting these         |
| 06:40      | services is great because if you're posting on [[Instagram]] anyway, this is stuff that you're          |
| 06:45      | sharing with other people, why not share it with yourself?                                          |
| 06:48      | Exactly, exactly.                                                                                   |
| 06:49      | And usually a lot of people, even if you're going to have one or two pictures of the day,           |
| 06:55      | [[Instagram]] is a great place.                                                                         |
| 06:57      | Usually those are the ones that you would want to capture, you know?                                |
| 07:00      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 07:01      | Have you done that yet?                                                                             |
| 07:02      | I haven't done that yet where I'm going to sit in my bed and have a perfect breakfast               |
| 07:06      | on a plate and everything perfect and just say this is an average day for me.                       |
| 07:10      | Have you done that?                                                                                 |
| 07:12      | The day that I accomplish that will be the day like after I've won the lottery and when             |
| 07:16      | I say won the lottery, I mean like the jackpot on like, I don't know, some huge multi-billion       |
| 07:22      | dollar lottery winning thing, as you can tell, I don't gamble, so yeah, that's not a thing          |
| 07:30      | that I've ever done.                                                                                |
| 07:31      | The closest I've come is like, hey, I managed to drink a glass of chocolate milk in bed             |
| 07:35      | and I didn't spill it, which, you know, that for me is a good start to my day and that would        |
| 07:39      | be journal worthy.                                                                                  |
| 07:40      | I don't know if I've ever done that.                                                                |
| 07:42      | You know, when I go to restaurants, I still put a napkin in front of my shirt because               |
| 07:46      | I'm that guy.                                                                                       |
| 07:48      | If there's one drop, I won't get it on my shirt, but that's not what people plugged                 |
| 07:52      | in today.                                                                                           |
| 07:53      | So the shortcuts, so to begin with with [[Day One]], you've got this activity feed where you            |
| 07:59      | can pull in location and photo data.                                                                |
| 08:02      | Another thing [[Day One]] does that's great is every time you make a new entry, it just grabs           |
| 08:06      | your current location as long as you're giving it access to your location and the weather.          |
| 08:11      | So like you can start a new entry, it automatically starts with what the current day weather is     |
| 08:16      | at the time you're making the entry and your location in addition to the time, of course.           |
| 08:21      | So there's a lot of automation stuff in there that's happening just by the nature of using          |
| 08:26      | the application.                                                                                    |
| 08:28      | As Rose mentioned, it has Siri shortcut support.                                                    |
| 08:31      | In my opinion, the Siri shortcut support could go deeper.                                           |
| 08:34      | It allows you to create a new entry, a new audio recording, a new video.                            |
| 08:42      | So it allows you to kind of automate the capture.                                                   |
| 08:47      | But as an automator, you can go deeper without even the application adding the support.             |
| 08:53      | And the way you do that is through Siri shortcuts, you can ask yourself specific questions.         |
| 08:59      | For instance, I was thinking about it, occasionally I talk about meditation, people want to get     |
| 09:06      | into that.                                                                                          |
| 09:07      | I think one way to do that would be maybe to keep a meditation journal.                             |
| 09:13      | And just every day write down if it helps, because it takes time for that stuff to really           |
| 09:17      | sink in and help you.                                                                               |
| 09:19      | But if you start writing about it a little bit after you do it every time, it actually              |
| 09:22      | may be a way to help you get better.                                                                |
| 09:24      | But if I were to do that, I would make a Siri shortcut that first says, how many minutes            |
| 09:29      | today?                                                                                              |
| 09:30      | How long did you stay on the cushion?                                                               |
| 09:32      | And then what were the challenging parts, what were the good parts?                                 |
| 09:36      | You could give yourself prompts in a sense of a journal.                                            |
| 09:40      | And then you run a Siri shortcut that asks you those questions.                                     |
| 09:44      | You can either type in your answers or you can dictate them in using Siri dictation.                |
| 09:49      | And then when it's done, it can use the new entry Siri shortcut with [[Day One]] to open day            |
| 09:55      | one, which will already have the date and time because it does that every time.                     |
| 10:00      | And then it'll dump that the prompts and your responses in in a nicely formatted text.              |
| 10:07      | And you know, because it can use markdown, which is no nice thing about [[Day One]].                    |
| 10:10      | So you could actually format the answers into markdown in the Siri shortcut and get the             |
| 10:16      | entry built for you.                                                                                |
| 10:17      | Yes, and that is where, so for example, as well as supporting markdown, it supports markdown        |
| 10:23      | extra, which means that you can input a table.                                                      |
| 10:25      | But I don't know if you've ever tried to write a table in markdown, David, I have.                  |
| 10:28      | It is frustrating because you've got pipes and you've got columns and you've got dashes             |
| 10:33      | and it means alignment.                                                                             |
| 10:35      | And then it doesn't quite line up and nothing looks right at all when you're writing it             |
| 10:39      | freehand.                                                                                           |
| 10:40      | But then when you render it, when you actually look at the finished product, it's really            |
| 10:44      | nice.                                                                                               |
| 10:45      | You want a table of this data, so maybe for example, going back to the meditation, you              |
| 10:50      | want to grab that data off the health app.                                                          |
| 10:51      | And while you're there, you may as well also grab the steps that you've done so far today,          |
| 10:56      | how long you slept, things like that.                                                               |
| 10:58      | You know, you can put this into a really nice table.                                                |
| 11:00      | You are not going to sit down and create a nice pretty table every day.                             |
| 11:04      | I can't imagine anybody doing that in any application voluntarily.                                  |
| 11:09      | That's the sort of thing that people get fed up with very quickly and it becomes a barrier          |
| 11:13      | to entry.                                                                                           |
| 11:14      | You can't stop doing this because it's hard to do.                                                  |
| 11:17      | But if you make that once, then you can fill it with the data every time and just send              |
| 11:21      | it on over.                                                                                         |
| 11:22      | And then at the end of your day, every day, you get all this nice information, which is             |
| 11:27      | exactly the sort of thing that you're going to want to look back at and go, I did have              |
| 11:31      | a good day that day.                                                                                |
| 11:34      | Look at all these things I did accomplish.                                                          |
| 11:37      | My buddy, Mike Schmitz, who co-hosts the focused podcast with me, made one that he has all          |
| 11:43      | of his daily prompts in there.                                                                      |
| 11:45      | And I actually texted him last night before we recorded to see if he's published that               |
| 11:49      | anywhere.                                                                                           |
| 11:50      | If he hasn't, I'm going to beg him to do that.                                                      |
| 11:52      | If not, I'll make some similar version and publish it with the show.                                |
| 11:55      | But he goes through and has all of his prompts from his day in there.                               |
| 12:00      | And he even has a little star system where you can just type stars in and it'll put stars           |
| 12:04      | to kind of rate different things you're doing during the day.                                       |
| 12:07      | And all of that stuff works perfect with a journal.                                                 |
| 12:11      | And I do think if you want to get a journalling habit, giving yourself little prompts every          |
| 12:15      | day is a great way to do it because you don't want to sit there and write about your bananas.       |
| 12:20      | You do want to write about stuff that's relevant to your life.                                      |
| 12:23      | And that's where you really get your money back out of creating a journal.                          |
| 12:28      | So if you need a little help getting started and you want to automate that process, a Siri          |
| 12:33      | shortcut would be a great way to do that.                                                           |
| 12:36      | Definitely.                                                                                         |
| 12:37      | And that's one of the things that I've been doing recently.                                         |
| 12:40      | I'm actually, I mean, [[Day One]] itself has got triggers to prompt you to write, but I'm               |
| 12:44      | using Launch Center Pro to promptly to run the shortcut, which will then give me all                |
| 12:51      | the prompts.                                                                                        |
| 12:52      | There's a lot of prompts in this to actually create a nice [[Day One]] entry with a bunch of            |
| 12:57      | different things.                                                                                   |
| 12:58      | And it checks my calendar so it knows, hey, like today was the weekend or I was on holiday          |
| 13:03      | or it was an actual holiday day.                                                                    |
| 13:06      | So I didn't go to work.                                                                             |
| 13:07      | So it asked me, you know, what I did versus like, what did you do at work and things like           |
| 13:11      | that.                                                                                               |
| 13:12      | Okay.                                                                                               |
| 13:13      | So you've got it looking at what, where is it looking at what day is, is that in Siri               |
| 13:16      | shortcuts?                                                                                          |
| 13:17      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 13:18      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 13:19      | So it does that.                                                                                    |
| 13:20      | And then based on that, it shows me different prompts.                                              |
| 13:23      | So it checks to start with whether or not it's weekend day by formatting it.                        |
| 13:27      | If you format it, if you format the date with five capital E is that gives you a one letter         |
| 13:31      | date.                                                                                               |
| 13:32      | So then I have to just check if it equals S. And because that Saturday or Sunday for                |
| 13:36      | some languages, of course, it's not quite so simple.                                                |
| 13:40      | And then if it's not one of those, then it will check my calendar and it checks my trip             |
| 13:45      | calendar for an all day event and it checks my, my work calendar for an all day event.              |
| 13:53      | So you're doing that in Siri shortcuts with an if statement, I would guess.                         |
| 13:56      | So if, if, if the, if the format date equals S, then give me the following questions prompts        |
| 14:04      | that are your weekend prompts.                                                                      |
| 14:06      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 14:07      | And you could even do that if you wanted to get fancy, like if you wanted to use Friday             |
| 14:11      | afternoon as a, as kind of a reflection period on your week, your work week or Monday as            |
| 14:17      | a planning day, you could say if, you know, the, the return is an F, then you could have            |
| 14:23      | some prompts about reflection on your week that just show up on Friday.                             |
| 14:28      | So this stuff can be really powerful and maybe you should share that one Rose with the, with        |
| 14:35      | the show.                                                                                           |
| 14:36      | And so it's not that difficult really, all you're doing is you're looking in Siri shortcuts         |
| 14:41      | for the day of the week and then an if statement.                                                   |
| 14:44      | And those are, that's not many steps, but once you see it, it'll make a lot more sense.             |
| 14:49      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 14:50      | And I've just had an idea about using a dictionary to add specific questions for specific days      |
| 14:54      | of the week.                                                                                        |
| 14:55      | So for example, you might want to answer three questions on a Wednesday to ask how your week        |
| 14:58      | is going.                                                                                           |
| 14:59      | And then two questions on Friday to ask how it's gone and Sunday, ask what you did at               |
| 15:04      | the weekend, you know, what you're looking forward to next weekend, things like that.               |
| 15:07      | And I've just had an idea of how to do that.                                                        |
| 15:09      | So I'm just going to write that down in [[Drafts]] and hopefully that will be out with the notes        |
| 15:13      | of this show.                                                                                       |
| 15:14      | And if you do it as a dictionary tree, it makes it easier for anybody using it to customise         |
| 15:18      | it.                                                                                                 |
| 15:19      | For instance, exactly.                                                                              |
| 15:20      | That's why I'm thinking of doing it that way.                                                       |
| 15:22      | I do my planning on, on Sunday, I don't do my plan on Monday.                                       |
| 15:25      | So, so, but I think I'm an oddball that way.                                                        |
| 15:27      | I think a lot of people like to take Sunday off, which is probably smarter than the way             |
| 15:31      | I do it.                                                                                            |
| 15:32      | But, you know, I did the planning stuff on Sunday afternoon, so I could put it there.               |
| 15:36      | But the idea behind all of this is just like I said, to make it easier to give yourself             |
| 15:41      | more of a, more of a motivation to put meat into one of these journals, which will actually         |
| 15:48      | make the journal work better for you.                                                               |
| 15:50      | So these are all good things.                                                                       |
| 15:53      | You can also do some stuff with [[Day One]], if you want to automate a text entry, I mentioned          |
| 15:58      | this on Mac Power Users recently, but for those that didn't catch that, I think day                 |
| 16:04      | one does a great job with text transcription.                                                       |
| 16:06      | It's using the built-in API, but it, I think the built-in API is a lot better than I thought        |
| 16:13      | it was.                                                                                             |
| 16:14      | I've been playing with it a lot lately and just press record on [[Day One]].                            |
| 16:18      | So the way it works is when you go to make your entry inside [[Day One]], you just press                |
| 16:22      | the record button and record, just like someone who's doing an audio diary.                         |
| 16:28      | But then when you're done, you press the button to transcribe and it transcribes it for you         |
| 16:31      | and it's very close.                                                                                |
| 16:32      | So at least for my voice, it works really good.                                                     |
| 16:35      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 16:36      | That's something that's really nice as well, especially, you know, like maybe typing is             |
| 16:40      | something that you're not going to enjoy doing at the end of the day and it's easier                |
| 16:43      | to just, you know, sit down and have a quick chat with your phone.                                  |
| 16:46      | You know, that's what all of these things are for, right, to get this information out               |
| 16:50      | of us in whatever format we want to do it.                                                          |
| 16:53      | And so, and if you're not using [[Day One]], you could of course use just press record for              |
| 16:57      | a very similar option and then you got both the audio and the text of it, which you can             |
| 17:02      | use later.                                                                                          |
| 17:03      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 17:04      | And then the other thing, trick you can do in it, this is a form of, and that's not                 |
| 17:07      | really automation, but it's a good trick anyway, [[Day One]] is you take a picture and when you         |
| 17:13      | add the picture to [[Day One]], it gives you the option to timestamp that entry to the time             |
| 17:19      | of the picture.                                                                                     |
| 17:20      | So as an example, I went out with my 21-year-old, I mean, anytime your 21-year-old wants to         |
| 17:25      | go out, you go out, you know, I mean, and I took a picture while we were out together               |
| 17:30      | and I'll make an entry today on that and the entry will be timestamped from our dinner              |
| 17:36      | out last night.                                                                                     |
| 17:37      | It won't be from, you know, today when I'm making the entry.                                        |
| 17:40      | So that's kind of cool.                                                                             |
| 17:42      | You want to talk about if this than that integration, a lot of people don't realise how deep that   |
| 17:46      | can run with [[Day One]].                                                                               |
| 17:47      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 17:48      | So, I mean, [[Day One]] has integration with if this than that.                                         |
| 17:51      | And essentially, all it can do is create an entry, but all it can do is not as limiting             |
| 17:58      | as it sounds because you can add an entry to almost any journal.                                    |
| 18:03      | If it's enter and encrypted, you can't add to it.                                                   |
| 18:05      | It only works on the ones that aren't encrypted, but you can do this based on a bunch of things.    |
| 18:10      | So for example, I'm subscribed to my Tripit calendar in Google Calendar, and I'm using            |
| 18:14      | Google Calendar for this because then whenever an event on that calendar starts, I can have         |
| 18:20      | a new entry added to my journal for travel.                                                         |
| 18:25      | So I have a specific travel journal.                                                                |
| 18:27      | And then every time something starts, like a flight starts or an event starts, it's in              |
| 18:33      | my Tripit calendar, it opens a new entry in the journal for me, which is really nice              |
| 18:39      | because then afterwards, like I can think back and go, oh, yeah, I really enjoyed the               |
| 18:45      | food that I had on the plane.                                                                       |
| 18:46      | And so I can write about that and that's in pictures to it.                                         |
| 18:48      | And it's already there with all that information for me.                                            |
| 18:52      | And obviously RSS feeds.                                                                            |
| 18:54      | So I log all of my blog entries and my micro blog entries into [[Day One]] into their own journals      |
| 19:01      | so that I've got those as well so that when I'm looking at it, I can go to it and I can             |
| 19:06      | just see everything in there that I've done, which is nice.                                         |
| 19:10      | And I've also, I use this podcast as an excuse to sign up for the premium VIP version of            |
| 19:17      | track.tv.                                                                                           |
| 19:19      | So for people not familiar, track.tv is a watching tracking service.                                |
| 19:25      | So it allows you to log everything that you watch films, TV shows, etc.                             |
| 19:32      | And it can produce an RSS feed, it can produce calendar feeds, all sorts of things.                 |
| 19:37      | And then I take that RSS feed from track.tv and I have that sent to [[Day One]].                        |
| 19:43      | So every time I watch something, I use [[Infuse]] on the [[Apple TV]] and on iOS a lot of the time          |
| 19:49      | to watch things, it will automatically log that for me.                                             |
| 19:54      | And so I'm sitting there and I've watched two episodes of, say, Death in Paradise, rewatching       |
| 19:59      | last season in anticipation of the new season coming next week, I believe, when this episode        |
| 20:04      | is.                                                                                                 |
| 20:06      | And that just gets added and it takes the show artwork and it puts that in as an image as           |
| 20:10      | well, which is really nice.                                                                         |
| 20:12      | And there are lots of apps for iOS for track TV.                                                    |
| 20:16      | I'm using check tracked where if I watch something on Netflix, I can log it as well.                |
| 20:21      | And so then, you know, like I go to the cinema, I can just log what I watched and it automatically  |
| 20:25      | creates a nice journal entry with the artwork and everything for me.                                |
| 20:29      | And then I can have my comments later at the end of the day.                                        |
| 20:31      | Yeah, basically anything with an RSS feed you can put in to [[Day One]].                                |
| 20:35      | And I think with an RSS feed, calendar feeds, you know, like adding new context to your             |
| 20:39      | iOS device could create a new journal entry.                                                        |
| 20:43      | Like, that's how crazy you can get with this.                                                       |
| 20:46      | And it's really nice to be able to do that because if those are important, then you can             |
| 20:50      | keep them.                                                                                          |
| 20:51      | And if it turns out that actually, I don't know, you added the cinema to your contacts              |
| 20:55      | so that every time you go there, you can just say, you know, ahoy, lady, I would like directions    |
| 21:01      | to cinema, then it also wants to find the cinema you mean instead of going, I found                 |
| 21:06      | 16 cinemas, Nick.                                                                                   |
| 21:09      | And you know, you can just delete that entry afterwards.                                            |
| 21:11      | And I find it's better to create more automated entries than I'm planning on using because          |
| 21:16      | I can just delete the ones that I don't want afterwards.                                            |
| 21:19      | It's easier than trying to create all of the ones that I did want.                                  |
| 21:22      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 21:23      | If TrackTV tracked me, it would just say that I watch a lot of saxophone players on YouTube.        |
| 21:29      | It does not track YouTube.                                                                          |
| 21:31      | It's for tracking, like, regular TV and films.                                                      |
| 21:35      | The service is actually free.                                                                       |
| 21:38      | It's just if you want the RSS feeds for automating journalling and so on, then you need to pay       |
| 21:43      | for it.                                                                                             |
| 21:44      | But I think it was $30 for a year and I thought considering how much I use it, that's not           |
| 21:48      | a huge price to pay to A, support the service and B, to get this data out, which is fun.            |
| 21:55      | Another thing I got thinking while you were talking is this is kind of going back to a              |
| 21:58      | serious shortcut, but I block my time for the day and I do adjust it as the day goes                |
| 22:04      | by.                                                                                                 |
| 22:05      | You know, like today we ended up recording earlier than we expected to.                             |
| 22:07      | So I've moved my blocks a little bit, but at the end of the day, there's no reason why              |
| 22:11      | I couldn't have Siri shortcut just pull the calendar, create like a text list of what               |
| 22:16      | I did in terms of events and put that at the top of my entry and just kind of put that              |
| 22:21      | in there for the day and fully automate it.                                                         |
| 22:24      | That would not be difficult.                                                                        |
| 22:25      | So this stuff is, I think Siri shortcuts really gives you a way to make journalling a lot easier     |
| 22:34      | than it traditionally would be.                                                                     |
| 22:36      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 22:38      | And I mean, you can also use something like TextExpander to give you a really nice template        |
| 22:43      | and you could do this on iOS as well in the TextExpander application with like pop-ups             |
| 22:47      | and fill-ins and all sorts of things.                                                               |
| 22:49      | Or you could use [[Drafts]] and you could have [[Drafts]] walk you through with a bunch of different        |
| 22:54      | prompts for things and you know, it could then have a really nice, you know, gives you that         |
| 22:59      | really nice text, really good text for you that everybody loves with the somewhat automated         |
| 23:04      | preview of things where you can hit preview button at any point and then you can save               |
| 23:08      | that over to [[Day One]] afterwards as well.                                                            |
| 23:10      | So there's a lot of automation options available.                                                   |
| 23:13      | Yes, there are.                                                                                     |
| 23:15      | And I want to talk about using those also outside of [[Day One]] next.                                  |
| 23:19      | But before we do, I want to take a minute to talk about our sponsor of this episode.                |
| 23:23      | This episode of The Automators is brought to you by PDF pin, the ultimate tool for editing          |
| 23:27      | PDFs from our friends over at Smile.                                                                |
| 23:30      | Now everybody has a need to use PDFs and you know, occasionally you need more than what             |
| 23:36      | [[Apple\|Apple's]] willing to give you and PDF pin is the application you need for that problem.               |
| 23:43      | With PDF pin, you can say goodbye to manual forms or remember getting out typewriters               |
| 23:48      | to fill out forms.                                                                                  |
| 23:49      | Maybe you're too young to have such a pain in the neck.                                             |
| 23:52      | But with PDF pin, you can go completely paperless and in addition to allowing you to manage         |
| 23:58      | and fill out PDFs, PDF pin and all of its versions has built in optical character recognition.      |
| 24:06      | And to me, this is one of the killer features of the application because when you get scanned       |
| 24:11      | documents sent to you, quite often they're not scanned for optical character recognition.           |
| 24:16      | That means you can't search them.                                                                   |
| 24:17      | You can't go through and make changes.                                                              |
| 24:19      | You can't.                                                                                          |
| 24:20      | There's a lot of things you can't do with them.                                                     |
| 24:21      | PDF pin, you just throw any PDF at it.                                                              |
| 24:23      | It says, Hey, I noticed this doesn't have OCR.                                                      |
| 24:26      | You say, please do it or you can just do it automatically and it gives you a nice little            |
| 24:29      | bong sound at the end and you've got OCR on your document.                                          |
| 24:33      | It's even automation friendly.                                                                      |
| 24:35      | Rose and I should talk about that someday.                                                          |
| 24:37      | Also with PDF pin, you can mark up and highlight PDFs.                                              |
| 24:40      | You can search and redact sensitive information like account numbers, you know, don't send          |
| 24:45      | your bank account information or your credit card number with the PDF, get it out of there.         |
| 24:50      | And that redaction is a way to get it out of there for good.                                        |
| 24:54      | You can correct text inside the PDFs, you can insert, remove, reorder pages, move and               |
| 24:59      | adjust images, record and playback audio annotations.                                               |
| 25:03      | That's a cool trick.                                                                                |
| 25:04      | I use the PDFs where when I go through contracts, sometimes I'll use PDF pin to record my voice     |
| 25:09      | talking about an extended problem and send it to someone they can listen to me talk about           |
| 25:13      | it.                                                                                                 |
| 25:14      | You can even add watermarks.                                                                        |
| 25:15      | And if that's not enough, you get the PDF pin pro, which allows you to create the PDF               |
| 25:20      | forms and to edit the table of contents, convert websites into PDFs and do a whole bunch more.      |
| 25:27      | And if you like dark mode, PDF pin supports that now.                                               |
| 25:30      | So with the most recent version 10.2, it's got full support for dark mode and Mojave,               |
| 25:35      | which looks good.                                                                                   |
| 25:36      | They even added smoother scrolling and some better thumbnail drawing and some other new             |
| 25:40      | features with that new version 10.2.                                                                |
| 25:44      | Basically when I bought PDF pin years and years ago for my Mac, it's just solved a huge             |
| 25:49      | problem for me and I daily deal with PDFs and I needed a more powerful tool.                        |
| 25:56      | So to learn more about PDF pin and PDF pin probe, go to smile software.com/podcast.           |
| 26:03      | And when you're there, let them know you heard about it here on automators and we really            |
| 26:08      | appreciate that.                                                                                    |
| 26:09      | And our thanks to PDF pin for all of their support of the show and all of relay FM.                 |
| 26:15      | So we talked a lot about automating [[Day One]].                                                        |
| 26:19      | Not everybody wants to use [[Day One]] though.                                                          |
| 26:21      | No.                                                                                                 |
| 26:22      | And I mean, I understand if you don't want to use it, you know, it might be that you                |
| 26:26      | specifically want to do something that's not able to be done in [[Day One]] or maybe, you               |
| 26:31      | know, you just don't feel that you're going to be using general or doing journalling enough          |
| 26:35      | to actually make any kind of investment right now.                                                  |
| 26:38      | And that's okay because there's probably a lot of other stuff that you already own that             |
| 26:41      | you can use to journal.                                                                             |
| 26:43      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 26:44      | I was thinking one of the best ways to do this for me, but this is another subscription.            |
| 26:48      | So, but Ulysses is an application allows you to contain text files and keep them in a sort          |
| 26:56      | of order and it's very automation friendly.                                                         |
| 26:59      | So you could take all of those prompts and those things we were talking about sending               |
| 27:02      | to [[Day One]], you could just as easily send that into a [[Day One]] folder and you could give             |
| 27:07      | each file a name because you name it using automation where you could have like the date            |
| 27:12      | string at the top of it and just drop that in to Ulysses.                                           |
| 27:18      | And I suspect a lot of people listening will have like a Ulysses subscription for, you              |
| 27:22      | know, other purposes.                                                                               |
| 27:23      | So if, you know, if you already have it, then you can also use it for this, you know, you           |
| 27:27      | can create different folders for things like that, which is always nice.                            |
| 27:31      | And another option that you could of course look at is [[Dropbox]] or iCloud files where you            |
| 27:37      | can have folders and you can have maybe one folder for a year and inside that folder for            |
| 27:42      | each month and then you just have dated text entries and you could put photos in there              |
| 27:46      | as well with, you know, give them the same, the name of the date or something and the               |
| 27:51      | time that they were taken at.                                                                       |
| 27:53      | Of course you won't be viewing photos in line with the text necessarily if you write everything     |
| 27:59      | in Markdown and save it as a Markdown file and then use something like marked on your               |
| 28:03      | Mac to preview it, then it can reference the local image.                                           |
| 28:07      | So that might work actually for you, it depends on what you want, of course.                        |
| 28:11      | I'd have to think about it a little bit further, but I wonder if you could save the images          |
| 28:15      | to like a hosting service like Droplr and then use Droplr links inside of the auto-created      |
| 28:21      | text.                                                                                               |
| 28:22      | I mean, it would require you putting your photos out there somewhere.                               |
| 28:26      | Yeah, I mean, you can just actually save it in the same folder and then, you know, just             |
| 28:32      | so the reference to the image normally in Markdown, if you're referencing an image,                 |
| 28:36      | it's exclamation mark, open square bracket, optional caption or alt text depending on               |
| 28:41      | the service, close square bracket, open round bracket, the reference to the file and traditionally  |
| 28:47      | this would start with something like HTTPS, kill on slash slash, URL goes here, image               |
| 28:52      | name goes here, dot image extension, close bracket, but you could just have, if the text            |
| 28:58      | file is in the same folder as the image, just put the name of the image in there.                   |
| 29:02      | Yeah, and I was thinking about this initially as just, you know, to make it super friendly          |
| 29:07      | and timeless, you just save it to a text file.                                                      |
| 29:11      | You could have a running text file, a pin to text file is an option available with most             |
| 29:16      | of the text editors that are automation friendly.                                                   |
| 29:19      | So you could have one file for your diary for the whole year if you wanted and you just             |
| 29:24      | append that Siri created prompt stuff to that text file.                                            |
| 29:29      | But then I got thinking another way you could do that is you could append, you could drop           |
| 29:33      | that text into a pages document and in the pages document, it just takes a minute to                |
| 29:39      | drag images and other media into the pages file and you can, you can place it exactly               |
| 29:45      | where you want to, you can even get fancy with a typography if you want, if you templated           |
| 29:49      | the pages file right.                                                                               |
| 29:52      | And then when you're done, you just render it as a PDF and that's fairly timeless, which            |
| 29:56      | is another way to make kind of a prettier journal if you want it.                                   |
| 30:00      | Yeah, and I mean, if you have a Mac or iOS device, then absolutely look into that.                  |
| 30:05      | If you're on Windows, then you might want to look into Word.                                        |
| 30:08      | If you've got Word or Dropbox paper is actually quite a nice solution for some of these things.     |
| 30:14      | It's a service offered by [[Dropbox]] where you can write text in [[Dropbox]] as it sounds.                 |
| 30:21      | But you know, you could use something like that or Google Docs maybe, though I would                |
| 30:27      | mention for people who are iOS heavy that their app doesn't usually get updated for                 |
| 30:32      | new features and screen sizes that quickly, which might mean that you end up having some            |
| 30:36      | awkward UI issues for a while every so often, that that's definitely an excellent solution          |
| 30:42      | on Android.                                                                                         |
| 30:43      | Now, you put an entry in the outline about doing instead of a personal journal, a public            |
| 30:48      | journal.                                                                                            |
| 30:49      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 30:50      | So, I mean, a lot of us have Twitter accounts and [[Instagram]] accounts and maybe four square          |
| 30:56      | accounts and all of these other things and we're everywhere on the Internet.                        |
| 31:00      | And what I do, I use a micro.blog, I actually host my own, well, public journal, essentially,       |
| 31:09      | and you can use micro.blog or you can host it yourself.                                             |
| 31:13      | I would recommend you look at the micro.blog website with their instructions for how to             |
| 31:18      | figure that out.                                                                                    |
| 31:19      | We're not going to cover that.                                                                      |
| 31:20      | But there are some really nice services that you can use in conjunction with this, like             |
| 31:24      | own your gram and own your swarm.                                                                   |
| 31:27      | And these are free services made by people who just want you to be able to get your own             |
| 31:31      | data.                                                                                               |
| 31:32      | And own your gram will take [[Instagram]] posts and host them to a micro.blog endpoint, such            |
| 31:36      | as the one available on micro.blog.                                                                 |
| 31:40      | And own your swarm does exactly the same thing with swarm four square check-ins.                    |
| 31:44      | And then that means that it's on the same place.                                                    |
| 31:47      | And what I use micro.blog for is it will then cross post to Twitter and master DOM for me.          |
| 31:53      | So essentially, if I create an image post, I'll do it on [[Instagram]].                                 |
| 31:57      | And then that gets cross posted to my blog, which then gets pushed out onto Twitter and             |
| 32:02      | master DOM for me.                                                                                  |
| 32:03      | But all text-based things, I do via the micro.blog app.                                             |
| 32:08      | And then they get pushed to everywhere else.                                                        |
| 32:12      | And then I do take this feed actually and put it back into [[Day One]], so that it's in                 |
| 32:17      | my private journal as well.                                                                         |
| 32:18      | But that's it.                                                                                      |
| 32:19      | It's a really nice public solution, and it gives you an RSS feed so that everybody can              |
| 32:23      | stock you at their own pace, which is always fun.                                                   |
| 32:26      | And then you can do something like that, and then you can still do the naval gazing type            |
| 32:31      | stuff in [[Day One]], which you keep private.                                                           |
| 32:34      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                      |
| 32:35      | And you can do that with almost anything.                                                           |
| 32:39      | Actually, you can actually just put it on a WordPress blog if you wanted to.                        |
| 32:45      | I just like micro.blog because you've got some social interaction there, which is nice.             |
| 32:49      | So if you post a fun picture, then you'll get comments back from people saying that                 |
| 32:53      | they like it or wanting to know where you got that really good-looking steak, things                |
| 32:57      | like that.                                                                                          |
| 32:58      | Now, I also use a paper journal, and I don't really have a good reason for it to tell you           |
| 33:05      | the truth, except I like playing with pens and paper.                                               |
| 33:09      | Yeah, everybody has to have fun in their life, and I also like playing with pens and paper.         |
| 33:15      | And for listeners listening who like pens and paper, you might want to listen to the                |
| 33:18      | pen addict as well, which is another show on Relay FM where Mike and Brad go all in                 |
| 33:23      | on pens.                                                                                            |
| 33:24      | Oh, man.                                                                                            |
| 33:25      | That show, I think how people tell me that, you know, Mac Power users cost them money.              |
| 33:28      | That show is one.                                                                                   |
| 33:29      | That is some dangerous stuff for me, man, when I listen to that show.                               |
| 33:33      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 33:34      | It can be dangerous, but at the same time, it's really fun listening to just a couple               |
| 33:38      | of people nerd out about something they love.                                                       |
| 33:40      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 33:41      | But anyway, so I've been doing that also for the year.                                              |
| 33:44      | I guess 2018 was the year I got serious about really kind of doing this every day.                  |
| 33:48      | And so I just use an empty paper planner.                                                           |
| 33:53      | There's no pre-printed stuff on it, but the use of it has evolved over the year.                    |
| 33:58      | And now I keep lists of things I've done during the day.                                            |
| 34:01      | Sometimes I have major things I want to complete.                                                   |
| 34:04      | Whenever somebody says something funny to me or something memorable, I'll write down a              |
| 34:07      | quote in it.                                                                                        |
| 34:08      | It's kind of a commonplace journal if you know what that is.                                        |
| 34:12      | And I really like it, but I want to automate that and bring it into my system.                      |
| 34:17      | So the way I do it currently is because I have a [[Day One]] account when I'm making my                 |
| 34:21      | daily entry in [[Day One]], I just take a picture of that page in the journal, in the paper             |
| 34:26      | journal, and that gets it automatically added.                                                      |
| 34:29      | You could also do that if you're not using something like [[Day One]].                                  |
| 34:33      | You could take the picture and with one of the apps like Scanner Pro, and then the other            |
| 34:40      | one is Scanbot.                                                                                     |
| 34:41      | Those are the two that I usually recommend.                                                         |
| 34:43      | And you take a picture with one of those and you can save it and you can run it through             |
| 34:46      | all the automation routines as well.                                                                |
| 34:49      | You could use the Siri shortcut to save it with the current date and the name Diary in              |
| 34:53      | it or something like that and save it to a specific location on iCloud or [[Dropbox]].                  |
| 34:58      | And then you basically get the paper journal, but you also have the permanence of the digital       |
| 35:03      | ones and zeros so you can see it later.                                                             |
| 35:05      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 35:06      | And some people might be thinking paper is permanent.                                               |
| 35:10      | The reason why I love the idea of taking a photo of it is because if heaven forbid there            |
| 35:15      | should be a house fire or something tragic happens, you've still got all of that stuff.             |
| 35:21      | I am always horrified when I see people just throwing old notebooks and so on out and I'm           |
| 35:26      | like, if you check what's in there, it's not important.                                             |
| 35:28      | It's like, someday you will regret that.                                                            |
| 35:31      | So yeah, take the photos of it and it's also nice because then especially if you're getting         |
| 35:37      | into playing with calligraphy and things like that, then you've got a record and you can            |
| 35:41      | easily compare four or five different pages without taking your probably very nice notebook         |
| 35:46      | apart.                                                                                              |
| 35:47      | And you can share it with people all around the world if you choose to do so, which is              |
| 35:52      | always a nice option to have.                                                                       |
| 35:55      | And while there's currently, to my knowledge, no application that's going to be powerful            |
| 36:00      | enough to look at a picture of my handwriting on a page and OCR that out, I'm sure that's           |
| 36:08      | coming.                                                                                             |
| 36:09      | So why not have digital images of these so you can run it through that app whenever it              |
| 36:13      | exists.                                                                                             |
| 36:14      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 36:15      | And then you don't have to go back and scan everything in one page after the other in               |
| 36:18      | the future.                                                                                         |
| 36:19      | You're saving yourself time by just taking one quick snap now.                                      |
| 36:23      | Another thing you could do to journal, another idea that occurs to me is if you like writing        |
| 36:29      | but you don't care about paper that much and you want to write with an [[Apple Pencil]]                 |
| 36:34      | on an iPad, the usual suspects would all be good at that.                                           |
| 36:41      | I would actually really recommend GoodNotes for this because they have a bunch of different         |
| 36:45      | template options.                                                                                   |
| 36:46      | So you can have the automation aspect of the actual template.                                       |
| 36:52      | So how would you rate this on a scale from one to five and things like that.                        |
| 36:58      | And it's very book-like.                                                                            |
| 37:00      | Notability is often one of my preferred applications, so I do use GoodNotes a lot.                  |
| 37:06      | And it has infinite scrolling, which is great, but if I want something that's more book-like,       |
| 37:09      | I always go for GoodNotes.                                                                          |
| 37:11      | Yeah, great.                                                                                        |
| 37:12      | And GoodNotes, you can add custom paper to this so you can create your own.                         |
| 37:16      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 37:17      | And so you can have the exact diary page you want with the exact prompts you want.                  |
| 37:23      | And you could even make them different ones for different days like we were talking about           |
| 37:26      | earlier and just fill that out with your [[Apple Pencil]].                                              |
| 37:28      | So anyway, there's a lot of ways to automate journalling.                                            |
| 37:32      | If you're thinking about it and you're listening to the show, maybe that's what you need to         |
| 37:38      | get a daily habit of doing it and why not?                                                          |
| 37:42      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 37:43      | And if you're looking for an app to track the fact that you're doing this daily habit,              |
| 37:47      | then I would highly recommend that you look at streaks.                                             |
| 37:49      | But we're going to come back to habits tracking as an automated adoption in the future episode,     |
| 37:54      | I think.                                                                                            |
| 37:55      | And [[Day One]] will give you a notification as often or as frequently or infrequently as               |
| 38:03      | you want.                                                                                           |
| 38:04      | But you could have it say, automatically prompt me to write an entry every night if you're          |
| 38:10      | going to do it yourself without [[Day One]], an application like Due is good at nagging               |
| 38:16      | you and you could have it tell you once a day, hey, create your journal entry.                      |
| 38:21      | Yes, which is something that when you're building a new habit, you would definitely like to         |
| 38:26      | have at least to help you get on the wagon.                                                         |
| 38:29      | So Rose, are you going to try and do a journal this year?                                           |
| 38:31      | Well, I mean, I've been trying to do it for a while and I've got some really good ideas             |
| 38:35      | now that I'm going to go away with and try and improve my techniques so that hopefully              |
| 38:39      | when I look back at the end of 2019, I'm going to have a year very full of journal.                 |
| 38:45      | And we'll put some screencast and at least one screencast and definitely some of these              |
| 38:52      | [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] we've been talking about so you can just download them directly and                |
| 38:56      | take advantage of our work on this stuff.                                                           |
| 38:58      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 38:59      | All right.                                                                                          |

| 40:00      | Well, happy new year, everybody, and good luck with this journalling thing.                          |
| 40:03      | Yes.                                                                                                |

| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this                 |
| 00:06      | is the Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your bidding           |
| 00:11      | for you.                                                                                            |
| 00:12      | Hello, Rosemary Orchard.                                                                            |
| 00:13      | Hello, David.                                                                                       |
| 00:14      | How are you?                                                                                        |
| 00:15      | Good.                                                                                               |
| 00:16      | It's been a few weeks since we talked.                                                              |
| 00:18      | I always am happy when we get on the microphone together to talk about crazy automation.            |
| 00:23      | Me too.                                                                                             |
| 00:24      | And this week, we have another person with us.                                                      |
| 00:27      | We could call this episode two Austrians and an American because we've got someone else,            |
| 00:32      | one of your countrymen.                                                                             |
| 00:33      | Welcome to the show, Simon Leeb.                                                                    |
| 00:35      | Hello.                                                                                              |
| 00:36      | Hello, Ros.                                                                                         |
| 00:37      | Hello, David.                                                                                       |
| 00:38      | Thank you for inviting me.                                                                          |
| 00:39      | I feel very honoured.                                                                                |
| 00:40      | We're big fans of your app.                                                                         |
| 00:42      | Simon is the developer of the PushCut app, which is a very handy tool if you're going               |
| 00:48      | to do automation.                                                                                   |
| 00:49      | Today, we're going to talk about how we use PushCut in our automation, and Simon's going            |
| 00:54      | to talk about the app.                                                                              |
| 00:56      | He's also going to talk just about some of the automation stuff Simon does to keep himself          |
| 01:01      | going.                                                                                              |
| 01:02      | I think this is going to be a really fun show.                                                      |
| 01:04      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 01:05      | I am very much looking forward to diving into some of the crazy ways that I have got PushCut        |
| 01:10      | set up, including the fact that when I got home today, I got approximately 10 notifications         |
| 01:14      | from PushCut.                                                                                       |
| 01:15      | And I'll tell you why as we get into it.                                                            |
| 01:17      | I can't wait to hear that.                                                                          |
| 01:19      | And I also can't wait to talk about everything you want to know about PushCut.                      |
| 01:22      | So Simon, how did you get started thinking about automation?                                        |
| 01:27      | You've built a whole application around it, so it must be a big deal to you, right?                 |
| 01:31      | I'm not really sure when I started automation.                                                      |
| 01:33      | I've been a programmer forever, like for 15 years at least.                                         |
| 01:38      | And so programming is you always automate when you program somehow.                                 |
| 01:44      | And all of that is, of course, surrounded by tools and utilities that automate.                     |
| 01:48      | But I think in the sense of what I guess iOS users and Shortcuts users and what this show           |
| 01:55      | is more about, I think it started when I kind of decided to go all in on home automation,           |
| 02:03      | do it yourself stuff for my apartment here.                                                         |
| 02:07      | And I bought a Raspberry Pi, and I bought all those components, and I coupled them together         |
| 02:12      | to do things.                                                                                       |
| 02:14      | And I would say that's when I really got hooked on automation and scripting stuff and connecting    |
| 02:21      | stuff, mainly in the home automation thing, actually.                                               |
| 02:25      | So did you get really started with [[HomeKit]]-type devices, or was it more of a rolling your           |
| 02:29      | own with just code that you wrote yourself, or something like, I'm forgetting the name              |
| 02:34      | [[Home Assistant]]?                                                                                     |
| 02:36      | I did look at [[HomeKit]].                                                                              |
| 02:37      | That was what I wanted to do, but I quickly learned, as I think many do, that there are             |
| 02:42      | not that many devices, especially in Austria, it seems to be even less than in the US.              |
| 02:48      | And the way you can connect them and combine them just felt very limited.                           |
| 02:53      | You're always kind of whatever is intended for you to do that kind of works, but you                |
| 02:59      | can't really draw outside the lines too much.                                                       |
| 03:03      | And so I quickly found out that there's this whole community around Raspberry Pis, and              |
| 03:09      | there's this whole do-it-yourself world, which I didn't really know before.                         |
| 03:13      | Oddly, I wasn't really much into the whole open-source world at all.                                |
| 03:18      | I was developing Microsoft server solutions for logistics, mainly that's very corporate-controlled  |
| 03:27      | own things.                                                                                         |
| 03:29      | So I didn't really clash with the whole open-source world too much, and I was amazed what's out     |
| 03:37      | there.                                                                                              |
| 03:38      | I mean, you can imagine somebody wrote it and hosted it on GitHub somehow.                          |
| 03:45      | So I was really quite blown away by what's there for you to get for free.                           |
| 03:51      | But I also quickly learned that it's not really for free, it costs a lot of blood,                  |
| 03:54      | sweat, and tears to actually make work and to really have it stably run at home.                    |
| 04:04      | But I really got hooked, and once you're in, you can't really go back.                              |
| 04:10      | And so I bought all those cheap devices that you can hook in your wall behind the switches          |
| 04:17      | and stuff like that, and basically did it all like that.                                            |
| 04:22      | The software I used is called OpenHab.                                                              |
| 04:25      | I don't really know how I came about it.                                                            |
| 04:27      | It's one of the bigger ones for do-it-yourself, I think, and that's pretty much what I connect      |
| 04:32      | everything with.                                                                                    |
| 04:33      | Well, it's always a challenge because Apple does have some automation built into [[HomeKit]],           |
| 04:39      | but it's not enough for a lot of folks, and every year they get a little better, like               |
| 04:45      | now that they've integrated Siri shortcuts with it, and even now if a listener of the               |
| 04:51      | show tries out push cut, there's so much stuff you can do with push cut with it, but it does        |
| 04:55      | kind of democratise it, makes it a little easier for people to use.                                 |
| 04:58      | But then at some level, it's like, okay, do I want to go to the Homebrew stuff?                     |
| 05:03      | Because there is definitely not only blood, sweat, and tears for the people making it,              |
| 05:07      | but also for the people installing it and using it for the first time.                              |
| 05:11      | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| 05:12      | That's what I meant by blood, sweat, and tears.                                                     |
| 05:15      | The price you pay for one of those [[HomeKit]] devices, it's a good price because what you              |
| 05:20      | spend time and playing around and fixing things and being frustrated for stuff not                  |
| 05:26      | really working, I'd rather pay like 30 bucks extra or something.                                    |
| 05:32      | It's all good with [[HomeKit]], I think.                                                                |
| 05:34      | You get simplicity.                                                                                 |
| 05:35      | Until [[HomeKit]] has a weird little issue and then doesn't quite work as you expect.                   |
| 05:40      | So for example, last night, we pressed the button to turn up all the lights in the apartment,       |
| 05:43      | and all but one light turned off.                                                                   |
| 05:45      | I don't know why, because when I ran it again from my phone instead of from a physical button,      |
| 05:50      | which runs that same scene, everything worked.                                                      |
| 05:53      | I am mystified.                                                                                     |
| 05:54      | But you get that with all of these solutions, honestly.                                             |
| 05:58      | I was talking to somebody in the know on this stuff and development on this, and he was             |
| 06:04      | telling me the big problem is that the radio bandwidth on these things is extremely limited.        |
| 06:12      | The more devices you add to your house, the more difficult it gets to find space to talk,           |
| 06:18      | so that's when you have one light gets missed, it's because there's so much happening in            |
| 06:23      | that narrow bandwidth that it just doesn't get the signal.                                          |
| 06:26      | Yeah, I had an issue once where, and it took me forever to figure this out.                         |
| 06:32      | I got new Wi-Fi routers at home, and I had the whole hue, I have a couple of hue lights,            |
| 06:39      | and the hue bridge somehow was like close to the Wi-Fi router, as I guess is true for               |
| 06:43      | many people, and things just started falling apart.                                                 |
| 06:46      | I would have really bad connection in my office, Wi-Fi wise, I had dropouts all the time,           |
| 06:50      | and I thought, well, this new Wi-Fi router is not good at all.                                      |
| 06:55      | Also, I noticed that a few lights, a hue light would behave weirdly, and luckily there is           |
| 07:03      | an option to change the channel on the hue thing, and suddenly everything worked again,             |
| 07:08      | and I just made me realise how those things are fighting for your airspace in your apartment        |
| 07:14      | somehow with all the frequencies intermixing and stuff like that.                                   |
| 07:19      | That's so tenuous, if you know what's going on.                                                     |
| 07:23      | That's one of the reasons why I like those Lutron Casetaa switches.                                |
| 07:27      | Another person, Robert Spivack, who was a guest on MPU a while back and is really connected          |
| 07:33      | on this home automation stuff, was telling me they have their own bandwidth.                        |
| 07:37      | They bought their own section of the spectrum for their switches, and I think that's why            |
| 07:44      | they work so good, is because they're not fighting with everything else.                            |
| 07:48      | But anyway, so you got some home automation stuff, you kind of went down that rabbit hole,          |
| 07:56      | and then at some point you decided, I'm going to use my development talents to make an app,         |
| 08:02      | an automation-based app.                                                                            |
| 08:03      | How did that happen?                                                                                |
| 08:04      | It's not that straightforward in a way.                                                             |
| 08:07      | I didn't actually think, oh, I'm going to build this app.                                           |
| 08:11      | It all started with this weird thought that while I still had my job, my regular job,               |
| 08:18      | I thought, you know what, maybe the life of an indie app developer is a good idea.                  |
| 08:25      | My reason immediately kicked in and said, what are you talking about, man, this is not              |
| 08:29      | a good idea at all.                                                                                 |
| 08:30      | You make a pretty decent living, you have a family and a home to take care of, don't                |
| 08:34      | do that.                                                                                            |
| 08:35      | But it kept just popping up in my head, and eventually it was almost as if my brain would           |
| 08:42      | say, if you don't do this now, you're just a coward.                                                |
| 08:47      | I couldn't really escape the track I put myself on, and I had a long list of app ideas.             |
| 08:53      | I would just start compiling those ideas, and one of them was, I looked it up today.                |
| 09:00      | It just said, and I'm pretty sure it was inspired by something [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] said on Connected.          |
| 09:06      | It wasn't really exactly this, but he basically reported excitedly about URLs and whatever          |
| 09:12      | he connected in the way only he can, and it was about some shortcut thing somehow.                  |
| 09:18      | I just took down this note, and basically it was something like trigger shortcuts from              |
| 09:25      | notifications.                                                                                      |
| 09:27      | It wasn't even the first idea on the list, and it definitely didn't seem like the easiest           |
| 09:31      | to do, but that kind of got paired with this other thing.                                           |
| 09:38      | So I have two more things, I would say.                                                             |
| 09:40      | One of them was, I was never quite happy with the direction that I felt the whole home automation   |
| 09:46      | was going where everything was voice controlled, and everybody had the series and the Alexis        |
| 09:51      | and whatever you have, and I was never a big fan.                                                   |
| 09:55      | It's good they work and nothing, series of lovely lady I'm sure, but I was never, maybe             |
| 10:00      | it's also the German thing, it doesn't feel all too reliable, and it always felt weird              |
| 10:06      | to me to speak out loud in my apartment, especially when other people are home.                     |
| 10:12      | And I always really loved the Apple Watch, the complications with quick buttons and that            |
| 10:19      | sort of thing.                                                                                      |
| 10:20      | I loved having the one, two taps for the things where you can trigger the things you                |
| 10:27      | do every day with a tap instead of talking to some lady in the can.                                 |
| 10:35      | And in a way, maybe the third direction that kind of flew into this, too, was that I once           |
| 10:43      | tried with my openHAB scripting thing, I tried to automate the light scene in our living            |
| 10:51      | environment with a couple of lamps and stuff like that, and I had a motion sensor that              |
| 10:56      | would see me come in the door and I would know which devices are at home, if my wife                |
| 11:01      | is at home, if I'm at home, I would even know how dark is it outside, what's the lighting           |
| 11:07      | conditions outside, and I just tried to script something that when I come home, but it's            |
| 11:12      | not too late, it should turn on this light and it should be this dimmed, and it's basically         |
| 11:17      | I felt you can't really do that well.                                                               |
| 11:20      | It's almost impossible to, in a way that doesn't eventually one day really frustrate you,           |
| 11:27      | automate that sort of thing fully automatic.                                                        |
| 11:30      | And that's basically the situation I learned where I thought, some things just have too             |
| 11:35      | many variables to do it fully automatic, it's just too complicated to really have to computer       |
| 11:40      | guess what you want in this situation.                                                              |
| 11:43      | And that's where I think this idea started, where I thought, well, if only it could just            |
| 11:47      | ask me like, or if only I had like two buttons next to the door where I could say, well,            |
| 11:52      | today is the evening kind of day, or it's the bright light kind of day, or it's the                 |
| 11:56      | don't wake up the kids kind of day, or something like that, I don't know.                           |
| 11:59      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 12:00      | You definitely add a degree of difficulty when you live with other people.                          |
| 12:03      | Oh yeah.                                                                                            |
| 12:04      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 12:05      | I mean, I have the same thing with my wife and kids, like I can get as fancy with the               |
| 12:09      | automations I want, but then you add that exponential difficulty of other people and                |
| 12:15      | things just don't work.                                                                             |
| 12:17      | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| 12:18      | Do you know the term WAP?                                                                           |
| 12:20      | No.                                                                                                 |
| 12:21      | What is it?                                                                                         |
| 12:22      | I learned this quickly in the forums when I was like Googling around for home automation.           |
| 12:26      | It's called wife approval factor.                                                                   |
| 12:28      | Oh yeah.                                                                                            |
| 12:29      | And it's, I think, an obstacle as nerds have to overcome.                                           |
| 12:32      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 12:33      | Anybody with a partner, even in my case, my partner is super techie, and he's into computers        |
| 12:39      | and everything, but he didn't get that sitting around half in the dark means that when he           |
| 12:43      | turns on one of the lights and then triggers the motion sensor, the motion sensor doesn't           |
| 12:47      | realise that he wanted to be sitting half in the dark, and then it turns that light                 |
| 12:52      | off up to 10 minutes.                                                                               |
| 12:53      | I've had to reprogram some home automations to be a little bit more, in my case, boyfriend          |
| 12:57      | approved rather than wife approved, but whoever you're living with at some point, they will         |
| 13:03      | get upset with you.                                                                                 |
| 13:04      | You're doing this stuff if you don't do it right, which is worth the reasons why adding             |
| 13:08      | that extra manual step may not be as automated as we want, but it's probably as automated           |
| 13:14      | as they want.                                                                                       |
| 13:15      | There's also this story, I'm sure you've come across this.                                          |
| 13:17      | I think David, even you talked about this once, when the whole hue lights came out and              |
| 13:21      | people would just put them in their regular sockets and then would say, well, it's great            |
| 13:26      | and all, but my spouse doesn't get it that she can't use the switches.                              |
| 13:30      | I always thought you have a completely wrong man.                                                   |
| 13:32      | Of course she'll use the switches or he'll use the switches.                                        |
| 13:36      | That's just not how this works.                                                                     |
| 13:38      | My assumption that, yeah, of course they're going to pull a phone out of their pocket               |
| 13:43      | and go to an app to turn the lights on rather than use, press the button that they've been          |
| 13:49      | using their entire lives.                                                                           |
| 13:51      | What could go wrong with that?                                                                      |
| 13:54      | Maybe the secret to success is to combine setting up home automation with moving house,             |
| 13:59      | because then they will never have the muscle memory of this light switch here does what             |
| 14:02      | I want.                                                                                             |
| 14:03      | No, you're never going to get past the light switch.                                                |
| 14:07      | You got to design it around people's preferences.                                                   |
| 14:11      | That's why in my case, buying the Lutron switches solve that problem because, oh yeah, the switch   |
| 14:16      | is still there.                                                                                     |
| 14:17      | They can turn it off and on, but I can still automate and the light situation is kind of            |
| 14:21      | handled for me, but triggering them, which is the problem Simon is talking about, is                |
| 14:26      | not necessarily solved because you're right.                                                        |
| 14:30      | I try to put automations built in when the front door opens, certain lights turn on,                |
| 14:36      | but then all of a sudden it doesn't always make sense.                                              |
| 14:39      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 14:40      | Yes, we have that.                                                                                  |
| 14:42      | We actually have a button now inside of our front door that when we leave, we press it              |
| 14:46      | once and we can just turn everything off.                                                           |
| 14:48      | When we come back, there are two different modes.                                                   |
| 14:50      | We can either double press it or press and hold, and the difference between those two               |
| 14:54      | is how many lights they turn on, where they turn them on, and how much they turn them               |
| 14:57      | on.                                                                                                 |
| 14:58      | One is intended for the somebody's at home probably already asleep situation or relaxing            |
| 15:04      | for the television, doesn't want to be blinded with lights, whereas the other one is, I've          |
| 15:08      | just got home and my tram was redirected and I'm running late and I want to record a podcast,       |
| 15:14      | nobody else is home.                                                                                |
| 15:15      | Light up everything please, which conveniently I use today because yes, my tram was redirected      |
| 15:19      | before recording this podcast.                                                                      |
| 15:22      | I think I may have talked about this on one of the podcasts, but I've got a button.                 |
| 15:28      | It's in a couple places in the house, but you press it and it turns basically all the               |
| 15:31      | lights on, except in the bedrooms.                                                                  |
| 15:35      | The idea of this is, of course, if you hear a noise or if you come home and you just want           |
| 15:39      | to light up the house, you press a button, it turns all the lights on, but I have this              |
| 15:43      | medication I take at night, it's an eyedrop, so I put these drops in and then I was putting         |
| 15:48      | my hand in the drawer to put the drops away with my eyes closed and I kept hitting the              |
| 15:53      | button and everybody in the house would either have the lights turn all on or turn all off,         |
| 15:59      | either of which was not ideal.                                                                      |
| 16:02      | Then I finally figured out how to do that where I would not accidentally trigger the                |
| 16:08      | button, but that's why you have push cut, right Simon?                                              |
| 16:11      | I think what Rose described before was exactly the type of situation I had in mind.                 |
| 16:17      | Sometimes you just want an option or you want a couple options to choose from and automation        |
| 16:22      | can't really do the final guess for you what's right right now.                                     |
| 16:26      | I think that's what...                                                                              |
| 16:27      | So all those things together, right, triggering shortcuts from somewhere, from the internet         |
| 16:32      | or something, and this sort of idea that voice control is not always great, you want to push        |
| 16:38      | a button at the right moment or you want to have an option presented to you at the right            |
| 16:43      | moment from your smart home or something.                                                           |
| 16:46      | Those all combined was basically when I thought, well, you know what?                               |
| 16:49      | That's what I'll do.                                                                                |
| 16:50      | I'll just make this push app that gives you options and that's basically how Push Get               |
| 16:57      | was born and the first version Rose remembers, I remember very fondly that you pretty much          |
| 17:04      | from version one saw what this did and wrote about it and the first version was basically           |
| 17:10      | just push notifications that you can hook up to shortcuts and run that.                             |
| 17:16      | But in my mind, it was never so much about automating shortcuts.                                    |
| 17:21      | It was always more about having automation ask you a question and you have the options              |
| 17:27      | to respond like with one tap.                                                                       |
| 17:30      | That's kind of what drove me.                                                                       |
| 17:32      | That's what I wanted to build and the shortcut initially was just, well, the first thing that       |
| 17:36      | came to my mind is what in a shortcut you can do whatever and you can especially call               |
| 17:42      | a web service or you can call a home kit scene.                                                     |
| 17:46      | And so I thought I'm good.                                                                          |
| 17:47      | I thought that's what I need to do, build a notification where you have multiple options            |
| 17:54      | of shortcuts.                                                                                       |
| 17:55      | That's how it all started in a way.                                                                 |

| 18:46      | I'm a big fan of TextExpander, I've been using it for years, I use it every day in                  |
| 18:49      | my legal practice, I also use it extensively with customer support for the MacSparky Field         |
| 18:55      | guides.                                                                                             |

| 19:57      | All right, let's dig in then on push cut.                                                           |
| 20:01      | Well, explain what the problem you're solving with push cut is.                                     |
| 20:04      | I know I guess you kind of did that before the break.                                               |
| 20:07      | I always had trouble explaining, you know, people would ask me, especially after I quit             |
| 20:12      | my job, like, what are you doing?                                                                   |
| 20:13      | And I said, well, I make this app and, you know, and I always struggle to come up with              |
| 20:17      | this, you know, one sentence pitch that everybody would say, yeah, that's a good idea.              |
| 20:22      | I think I still haven't because in a way, it's this utility that you can connect, you               |
| 20:29      | know, from anywhere, anything that, you know, produces events, if you will, your home automation,   |
| 20:35      | your, you know, professional Zapier hookup, some if event, whatever, can, can ask you               |
| 20:42      | a question on your phone can say, Hey, this has happened.                                           |
| 20:46      | What now?                                                                                           |
| 20:47      | Like what do we do about this?                                                                      |
| 20:48      | So and being this open, it's, it's kind of difficult to, to, to tell people what it                 |
| 20:54      | really is.                                                                                          |
| 20:55      | Well, in my head, it's the app that combines automation with options, which nothing else            |
| 21:00      | does that to my knowledge.                                                                          |
| 21:03      | Because you, you've got automation stuff in there, time based triggers, location based              |
| 21:07      | triggers.                                                                                           |
| 21:08      | But then it gives you, it doesn't just run one shortcut, it gives you, you know, three              |
| 21:14      | shortcuts and you can pick one that you want to run.                                                |
| 21:16      | I mean, that's the way I use the app and, and there's, you know, even when shortcuts                |
| 21:21      | got automation based triggers in it, it didn't give you those options the way push cut does         |
| 21:26      | and in my head, that's why your app stands out.                                                     |
| 21:31      | You know, it's funny, the, the location and time based things, I didn't really think about          |
| 21:35      | that too much in my mind.                                                                           |
| 21:37      | It was, well, clearly once you have the, the web hook, you know, that's good enough for             |
| 21:41      | everybody because sure everybody knows what everybody's comfortable pasting those ugly              |
| 21:46      | URLs around and that might, might not have been that true.                                          |
| 21:52      | And so even I, whenever somebody asked me, so what do you do with it?                               |
| 21:56      | My first two examples were, well, in the evening, it could ask you which type, type of light        |
| 22:01      | you want to turn on, or when you come home, it could ask you, should we open the garage             |
| 22:06      | door or should we open the front door and, and even my examples were almost always like             |
| 22:11      | the simple ones based on time or location.                                                          |
| 22:15      | So I quickly learned that, well, you know, just put it in there as a default option.                |
| 22:19      | And that was before shortcuts introduced their automations.                                         |
| 22:23      | Maybe I wouldn't have done it then, I'm not sure, but at the time it felt like the right            |
| 22:27      | thing to do.                                                                                        |
| 22:29      | And what I think is a good idea was you can combine locations and time sort of constraints          |
| 22:35      | is what, what the app calls it.                                                                     |
| 22:37      | So you can say, when, when I'm at home, or you could say, when I get home, but only                 |
| 22:42      | in the afternoon, during the week or something, then trigger this on all the other occasions,       |
| 22:48      | don't even bother.                                                                                  |
| 22:49      | Or, or like, like, you can say, you know, at a certain time of day, when I'm at a certain           |
| 22:55      | location, which is nice, I think, especially those evening type of things you do at home,           |
| 23:01      | you just don't need when you're somewhere else, right?                                              |
| 23:04      | It makes no, there's no, no point.                                                                  |
| 23:06      | And I didn't even find any, any other app that would allow that sort of scheduling,                 |
| 23:10      | really.                                                                                             |
| 23:11      | So I think that's quite nifty.                                                                      |
| 23:12      | And my, one of my favourites, which I'm aware the world doesn't really care too much.                |
| 23:17      | It feels like a bit of a forgotten thing.                                                           |
| 23:19      | Are I beacons?                                                                                      |
| 23:20      | I'm not sure if you guys use them, but I, I do use them.                                            |
| 23:24      | That's that's one of the, the ways that I get a lot of actual pushback notifications.               |
| 23:27      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 23:28      | The geo fencing is just like, I don't, I think it's an unwritten rule somewhere, but the,           |
| 23:34      | the, the region you can mark shouldn't be less than a hundred meters in radius, which               |
| 23:39      | is a pretty big area, right?                                                                        |
| 23:41      | And it's just, it's just not fine grained enough for certain things, I believe.                     |
| 23:47      | And I beacons, if, if you're willing to play with it a little, you have to set them up              |
| 23:51      | and it's a bit, you know, it's a bit of a nerdy thing to do, but, but they were pretty              |
| 23:56      | reliably I felt and that's, it's probably something Apple will never build in, right?               |
| 24:01      | Is give you the option to program an I beacon.                                                      |
| 24:04      | It feels.                                                                                           |
| 24:05      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 24:06      | We're, we're going to have to cover that at some point in the show.                                 |
| 24:09      | Both Rose and I have some of them and, and you can like get room-based automation with              |
| 24:13      | an I beacon.                                                                                        |
| 24:14      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 24:15      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 24:16      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 24:17      | In my case, I find it's much more accurate than the location.                                       |
| 24:20      | So I, I've been trying a few things.                                                                |
| 24:21      | So I've had a push cut sending me notifications for when I get home like geo wise and then          |
| 24:27      | when I get home, I beacon wise and the geo wise always happens without fail within a                |
| 24:32      | like one and a half block radius.                                                                   |
| 24:34      | So I get to the one and a half block radius and then it triggers.                                   |
| 24:38      | And then I actually get to my front door at which point the I beacon goes, hello, I'm               |
| 24:41      | here and push cut goes, Hey, you're home.                                                           |
| 24:43      | And then they're going to get that this is clearly the much more accurate one.                      |
| 24:46      | Of course, it doesn't hurt that my apartment is relatively small, but at the same time              |
| 24:50      | my I beacon is on my desk, which is the farthest point away from the front door in my apartment     |
| 24:54      | possible.                                                                                           |
| 24:55      | And it works perfectly.                                                                             |
| 24:57      | So.                                                                                                 |
| 24:58      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 24:59      | As far as you know, you can, you can program the signal strength of the beacon and based            |
| 25:03      | on this setting, the phone will see it, you know, further away or closer and you can really         |
| 25:09      | go down.                                                                                            |
| 25:10      | You can make an I beacon.                                                                           |
| 25:11      | I don't know what the limits are, but you can easily say only when I'm in this room                 |
| 25:15      | and it wouldn't even register in the, in the room, you know, in the, in the next room because       |
| 25:20      | you can, you can basically make the signal so weak that the phone doesn't see it before             |
| 25:26      | that.                                                                                               |
| 25:27      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 25:28      | That's what makes them pretty, pretty nifty for location based stuff, I think.                      |
| 25:31      | Somebody needs to simplify that for consumers.                                                      |
| 25:33      | I mean, they, they're a pain in the neck to set up and nobody has really done that.                 |
| 25:39      | But the, but yeah, I agree.                                                                         |
| 25:41      | We're going to probably do a show on I beacons at some point.                                       |
| 25:43      | I think it makes sense on the automators.                                                           |
| 25:45      | We just got to, got to get to that one on the checklist, you know, in my old job, there             |
| 25:50      | was this saying, because, you know, GUIDs or UIDs as Apple calls them, they're ugly, right?         |
| 25:55      | If you see them, you want to, if you're not a developer, you just, you know, want to turn           |
| 25:59      | around.                                                                                             |
| 26:00      | It's, it's not something you should ever see.                                                       |
| 26:02      | And we always used to say, if a UI has a, as a GUID, it's, it's wrong.                              |
| 26:07      | Like you can never have that.                                                                       |
| 26:08      | It's not something that can ever exist.                                                             |
| 26:10      | But with I beacons, there's no other way around because that's the only way you can speak           |
| 26:14      | to them is, is with those long or with this long, ugly ID.                                          |
| 26:18      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 26:19      | It's not really, not really good look.                                                              |
| 26:21      | Unfortunately, but aside from that, they are very useful.                                           |
| 26:25      | So they have their advantages.                                                                      |
| 26:27      | I want to talk about, we just kind of glazed over the fact that push cut uses web hooks             |
| 26:33      | as well.                                                                                            |
| 26:34      | I mean, in addition to the time and location stuff on device, you've got this great web             |
| 26:39      | hook system.                                                                                        |
| 26:40      | Could you explain that?                                                                             |
| 26:41      | Sure.                                                                                               |
| 26:42      | That was really, that's kind of in the heart of it all.                                             |
| 26:44      | It's almost more a service than it is an app, because if in order for your phone to like            |
| 26:51      | pop something up in your face, it needs to know when and why.                                       |
| 26:55      | And the things you can do on device itself are very limited.                                        |
| 26:58      | It's basically, you can say when I enter or exit this location, or you can say at this              |
| 27:03      | time, that's pretty much it.                                                                        |
| 27:06      | So you can never say, well, when I get an email from here or there, or when this sort               |
| 27:11      | of device does something, even with [[HomeKit]], there is no way you can do that on, like you           |
| 27:15      | can program your phone to do something when a certain condition is met.                             |
| 27:22      | And even with shortcuts now, like of course you have the shortcuts automations, which               |
| 27:26      | are those great entry points for those everyday things.                                             |
| 27:31      | But you can't really, I don't know, define a good condition where you say when this happens         |
| 27:38      | on that sort of day, and then only then do I want to have this notification.                        |
| 27:42      | So it was pretty clear to me that the easiest way is the push notification system, which            |
| 27:48      | Apple has built, but you need a server for this, right?                                             |
| 27:51      | And there's the only way on your devices through the internet, really, there's no other way.        |
| 27:56      | So it was pretty clear to me I needed to build some sort of web service with a web hook.            |
| 28:02      | And what I tried to build was something that's so simple that I always wanted the app to            |
| 28:08      | be no login, no three step sign-in process.                                                         |
| 28:13      | You just install, you define a notification, and you get a URL that's both secure, but              |
| 28:20      | that's all you need.                                                                                |
| 28:21      | You just paste this thing somewhere, and that's all you need to trigger.                            |
| 28:25      | That's the unique key for your device with this notification.                                       |
| 28:29      | That was always kind of the guiding star.                                                           |
| 28:31      | That's what I wanted to build, and that's what I built, basically.                                  |
| 28:35      | And with this, if you have this URL, you can trigger it from IFTTT, you can trigger it from           |
| 28:41      | Zapier or all those online services.                                                                |
| 28:44      | And of course, now, and that's, I think, one of the coolest things ever, you can trigger            |
| 28:48      | it from [[HomeKit]].                                                                                    |
| 28:50      | And this makes it very simple to set up for Apple smart home nerds, I think, is you can             |
| 28:57      | actually just run it from a [[HomeKit]] automation.                                                     |
| 29:01      | That is how I got for ultimately 15 notifications when I got home from work today.                  |
| 29:06      | So do you want to give us a quick overview of how you do this?                                      |
| 29:08      | Because obviously, I know how to do this, but it would be better in your words.                     |
| 29:12      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 29:13      | It took me a while to kind of see what's happening there, because I, of course, saw the [[WWDC]]        |
| 29:19      | where they introduced shortcuts and was all cool and all, and they said it's runs on                |
| 29:25      | [[HomeKit]] too, and I didn't really think much of it.                                                  |
| 29:29      | And I think it was, again, probably [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] or somebody that says, huh, I have this alarm          |
| 29:33      | system at home where I can run some webhook to notify my device and I thought, what?                |
| 29:41      | And then I kind of saw for the first time, of course, that's what I always wanted to                |
| 29:46      | build was a thing where your home automation in a simple way with something you define              |
| 29:51      | when it happens, you know, asks you the question, hey, like, it's, I don't know, it's, it's         |
| 29:56      | getting warm.                                                                                       |
| 29:57      | Should I turn off the heat?                                                                         |
| 29:58      | Yes or no?                                                                                          |
| 29:59      | And, and you just with one tap, ideally on your watch can say, sure, let's turn it off              |
| 30:04      | or no, no, no, no, I'm still like, not now's not a good time for this sort of thing.                |
| 30:08      | And with the added shortcut support for [[HomeKit]] automations, what you can do is you can convert     |
| 30:14      | your like previously, you could only trigger a scene or run a scene.                                |
| 30:19      | So you define a scene like evening lights.                                                          |
| 30:22      | And when something happens, you could say run evening lights.                                       |
| 30:25      | And now you can say, instead of run evening lights, convert to shortcut.                            |
| 30:29      | And you have a couple of those shortcut actions, not all of them, but, but enough to trigger        |
| 30:34      | a webhook basically.                                                                                |
| 30:36      | And so inside this automation in [[HomeKit]], you just say, execute or I think it's called              |
| 30:43      | get contents of URL, and then you paste in the webhook from push cut.                               |
| 30:47      | And that's really all the setup you need.                                                           |
| 30:50      | And whenever this condition is happening, your [[HomeKit]] hub will just ping your devices              |
| 30:59      | or your device and ask the push cut question.                                                       |
| 31:02      | And combined with the feature that you can run [[HomeKit]] scenes directly from the push                |
| 31:08      | cut notification, it's that's when I felt right.                                                    |
| 31:12      | That's exactly what I wanted to build all along was this one thing that pops up and                 |
| 31:17      | just asks, hey, the red light or the blue light today, and you just tap blue right then             |
| 31:21      | and there.                                                                                          |
| 31:22      | And that's it.                                                                                      |
| 31:23      | And the blue lights on and it's all instantly like there's almost zero delay because it's           |
| 31:27      | from your device using the [[HomeKit]], Apple API, that's all fast and works.                           |
| 31:34      | And the notification system is pretty much instant too.                                             |
| 31:38      | So I was quite happy with that, to be honest, I felt like now it has arrived.                       |
| 31:42      | Now that's what I wanted.                                                                           |
| 31:44      | And you add in the Apple Watch app in the mix.                                                      |
| 31:47      | And it's truly magical little interactions, I feel like.                                            |
| 31:50      | That's kind of like that happened recently.                                                         |
| 31:53      | So a few weeks ago, I felt like now it's what I always wanted it to be in a way.                    |
| 31:58      | Well, before we dive into the Apple Watch app, I do just want to ask a few more questions           |
| 32:02      | because you mentioned that you can just paste the URL for the notification to the get contents      |
| 32:07      | of your election.                                                                                   |
| 32:08      | But I know that that makes a get call, which basically goes, hello, can you give me something?      |
| 32:14      | But I know if you switch to a post call, you can also send a bunch of things to push cut            |
| 32:19      | and then it can change things, for example, that are different actions available based              |
| 32:23      | on that.                                                                                            |
| 32:24      | Can you tell us about that?                                                                         |
| 32:26      | Yes, I always felt like for this to be truly powerful, you shouldn't just trigger like              |
| 32:34      | a static thing, like it shouldn't just be defined a notification with the same text that            |
| 32:39      | you just say now pop up.                                                                            |
| 32:41      | It's much more meaningful if the thing that triggers it can say, you know what, this happened       |
| 32:46      | exactly like that.                                                                                  |
| 32:47      | And it's now this many degrees and it's like this time or I don't know, this person just            |
| 32:50      | came home and to give you the text of what has happened.                                            |
| 32:55      | And since I had to build this, I thought, why not just make it all customisable and basically       |
| 33:03      | what you can do through this chase and interface, you can customise the text, the title, and        |
| 33:10      | you can even pass in a list of actions that your notification will show.                            |
| 33:15      | So you can, I don't know, based on the condition, you can have your notification give you different |
| 33:21      | options and you don't actually need to statically configure them in the app at all.                 |
| 33:25      | You could just make it all dynamic basically and have some sort of server code figure out           |
| 33:30      | what you want this notification to be about.                                                        |
| 33:33      | That's definitely a more advanced case.                                                             |
| 33:34      | I would say most people will probably customise the text and there's also this thing called         |
| 33:41      | input.                                                                                              |
| 33:42      | It was pretty clear to me that if a certain condition pushes a notification and you tap             |
| 33:48      | an action, there might be some sort of information that you have to pass along for the action       |
| 33:53      | to be able to be executed.                                                                          |
| 33:55      | So say if you want to run a shortcut that needs to do something, the shortcut might want            |
| 34:02      | to know in what context we were or what exactly happened or what type of timer I should start       |
| 34:08      | or something like that.                                                                             |
| 34:10      | So I just came up with this very simple input system.                                               |
| 34:13      | It's basically a string, like a value, and if you pass a value with a notification and              |
| 34:21      | you tap on an action, this value is passed along to the action you execute.                         |
| 34:26      | And if it's a [[HomeKit]] scene, there is no input.                                                     |
| 34:28      | [[HomeKit]] scenes don't take any input.                                                                |
| 34:29      | You can't.                                                                                          |
| 34:30      | I don't know.                                                                                       |
| 34:31      | That's just not technically possible.                                                               |
| 34:34      | But with shortcuts, it's possible.                                                                  |
| 34:36      | And if you really want to go all in, you can run any URL or you can run online actions.             |
| 34:41      | And then you can use this input to, I don't know, make your encoded in your URL, run maybe          |
| 34:46      | some sort of IFTTT command.                                                                           |
| 34:48      | And the IFTTT command can take this input and then send it on to wherever it needs to be              |
| 34:52      | sent on.                                                                                            |
| 34:53      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 34:54      | So that's that.                                                                                     |
| 34:55      | I have to say, maybe I'm the one distorting the statistics because pretty much every time           |
| 35:00      | I run a push cut notification, I do it with a post because I try to minimise the total              |
| 35:05      | number of notifications I have just so that when I look in the app, I'm not there going,            |
| 35:09      | okay, screencast online, screencast online, screencast online, screencast online, you               |
| 35:13      | know, repeating the same sort of title six or seven times.                                          |
| 35:17      | I just have one for screencast online.                                                              |
| 35:20      | And then whenever something happens with one of my videos in the project management system          |
| 35:24      | there or with one of the articles I'm writing for the magazine, it uses that notification,          |
| 35:29      | but it customises what to show me and if it should offer an action.                                 |
| 35:33      | And if so, what action should be offered based on exactly what, which Zapier's app in my case        |
| 35:38      | is triggering it, which I find to be so useful.                                                     |
| 35:42      | So thank you for adding that.                                                                       |
| 35:44      | Sure.                                                                                               |
| 35:45      | But I do think we got a little bit deep in the stack here pretty fast.                              |
| 35:50      | The whole idea of these webhooks, you know, listening to it, you may be confused about              |
| 35:55      | where do you get the webhook.                                                                       |
| 35:57      | It's in the app.                                                                                    |
| 35:58      | It's generated based on the, I don't want to call it shortcut, but the automation you               |
| 36:04      | create in push cut gives you that and then you can take that and use it how you want.               |
| 36:10      | So the application just really simplifies the process.                                              |
| 36:13      | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| 36:15      | It definitely does.                                                                                 |
| 36:16      | So at the moment, I actually, I only have six notifications here in push cut.                       |
| 36:20      | But then if I tap on it, then underneath the name, there's the webhook URL.                         |
| 36:24      | And I tap on that, it offers me the option to copy the URL or copy it as a curl command             |
| 36:29      | or share it, which we will get to the usage of the curl commands later, I'm sure.                   |
| 36:36      | Let's just talk through a couple, just explain a couple, like you've got some examples on           |
| 36:40      | your website.                                                                                       |
| 36:41      | I think it's great.                                                                                 |
| 36:42      | If you're interested in this, you should have head over to push cut.io.                             |
| 36:46      | And there's a bunch of simple examples there where he's got screenshots to show you how             |
| 36:51      | he built the automation, and like he's got one here that when it's sunset, it doesn't               |
| 36:56      | just turn your lights on, it gives you a menu of do you want the dinner light set up the            |
| 37:01      | evening light set up the movie time light set up, you know, which is really great.                  |
| 37:06      | And then he's got one where he's showing how to combine push cut to automatically create            |
| 37:13      | time entries and toggle based on your location.                                                     |
| 37:17      | You know, these are all real world examples that anybody could build.                               |
| 37:20      | If you just take a look at these, you'll see it's not that difficult.                               |
| 37:23      | And then you can kind of go from there as well.                                                     |
| 37:26      | I really like your sample assignment because I think that was, for me, it was a good place          |
| 37:29      | to kind of start building things.                                                                   |
| 37:31      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 37:32      | In fact, I believe I should do more of them.                                                        |
| 37:35      | But then I also feel like maybe somebody else can, you know, share their stories a bit more         |
| 37:40      | and I can focus on the coding because I don't necessarily like that sort of work, to be             |
| 37:47      | honest.                                                                                             |
| 37:48      | And there, let's put it like this.                                                                  |
| 37:49      | There are others that do it way better than I.                                                      |
| 37:51      | And so to me, the guides page feels more like a marketing necessity than anything I feel            |
| 37:57      | like I should be doing really, but it's needed to get the, to tell the story, I think.              |
| 38:03      | And I would like to take a moment to mention that if anybody is using push cut, which I'm           |
| 38:07      | sure a lot of our listeners are because people keep asking me for a push cut show, but then         |
| 38:11      | please share what you're using it for in the forums because that would be really interesting.       |
| 38:15      | A couple of screenshots maybe of how you're using the app as well would be really nice              |
| 38:18      | because I think this is something that is presented in many ways better in a visual                 |
| 38:23      | format than audio.                                                                                  |
| 38:24      | So it's great that we're doing an audio podcast here, but I'm hoping you can understand it.         |
| 38:29      | It just looks extremely nice as well when you run it.                                               |
| 38:33      | So for example, the options are the different scenes.                                               |
| 38:36      | You know, you've got emoji added next to them, which just gives you that one character              |
| 38:40      | clue of, oh yeah, this is the option I want and you don't have to be, you know, energetic           |
| 38:45      | and actually read words, which if it's time for bed and that's what's the notifications             |
| 38:50      | telling you, then maybe you don't really want to read and you just want to tap the one that's       |
| 38:54      | got the bad icon on it and be done.                                                                 |
| 38:55      | Well, well, definitely one of the Pushcut, things I like better than shortcuts is the             |
| 39:01      | way it displays its menu options.                                                                   |
| 39:05      | You know, it just, you can tell me, you know, Simon, you spent some time kind of designing          |
| 39:10      | that interface and whereas with shortcuts, it's just kind of this text list and it's                |
| 39:16      | okay for one or two options, but when you get a long list, it gets really tedious the               |
| 39:20      | way shortcuts does it.                                                                              |
| 39:22      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 39:23      | And another advantage I found with push cut is because push cut offers that menu from               |
| 39:27      | the notification, which shortcuts doesn't do.                                                       |
| 39:30      | And also you have the actual name of your notification telling you important information            |
| 39:34      | instead of just run the shortcut.                                                                   |
| 39:36      | And so I'm finding it really useful because I can just tap on that notification and it              |
| 39:40      | gives me that list right there of the different options that I've chosen to be available to         |
| 39:44      | me and then it works.                                                                               |
| 39:45      | And I really like that.                                                                             |
| 39:47      | That was kind of the first idea was to have it in the notification when you expand them.            |
| 39:51      | I always like those notification actions or let's put it like this.                                 |
| 39:55      | It's not something that you think about a lot, but I always, I always notice when an app            |
| 40:00      | doesn't have those, right, when your app gives you a notification and you kind of a 3D touch        |
| 40:04      | or long press or whatever, whatever the kids call it these days.                                    |
| 40:08      | And it's just nothing.                                                                              |
| 40:09      | It's just this empty notification with no action.                                                   |
| 40:12      | I always notice this and I thought, well, I'd really like to just tap yes or no or open             |
| 40:17      | or dismiss or something.                                                                            |
| 40:20      | And so for me, that was clear that this was like a, that needs to be in like to be directly         |
| 40:26      | in the notification.                                                                                |

| 41:25      | All right, Simon, there's something on your website here that I'll admit it's a rabbit              |
| 41:31      | hole.                                                                                               |
| 41:32      | I have not gone down, but it looks like it could be pretty cool.                                    |
| 41:35      | Explain to me the JSON integration with push cut.                                                   |
| 41:40      | So I guess you were talking about the API itself, right?                                            |
| 41:44      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 41:45      | So in a way, you can trigger push cut notifications in two ways.                                    |
| 41:50      | One is just just copy paste the URL you get from the app.                                           |
| 41:53      | Don't even think about it.                                                                          |
| 41:54      | Just slap it in there.                                                                              |
| 41:55      | It's all safe and good.                                                                             |
| 41:56      | You'll be fine.                                                                                     |
| 41:57      | And it triggers a notification on your phone.                                                       |
| 42:01      | And you can, if as Rose said before, if you turn it, if you make it a post instead of               |
| 42:05      | a get command, it's like basic web stuff, right?                                                    |
| 42:09      | If you change it to post, you can attach this JSON thing.                                           |
| 42:13      | And that's pretty much that.                                                                        |
| 42:14      | But you can also use the push cut API, which in a way doesn't give you all that much more           |
| 42:23      | for just the pushing of notifications.                                                              |
| 42:26      | But what you can do is you can instead of having the secret in a URL, which let's put               |
| 42:31      | like this, it's safe enough for what it does.                                                       |
| 42:34      | But wherever you run this, if you cannot fully trust the machine this runs on, which I hope         |
| 42:41      | you usually do, for example, if you test it out and you copy the URL into a browser somewhere,      |
| 42:47      | it'll be in the browser history.                                                                    |
| 42:49      | And the URL is all you need to trigger the notification, it should be a big deal.                   |
| 42:54      | But in general, for like security purposes, it's not the best look to have like a secret            |
| 43:01      | in the URL directly.                                                                                |
| 43:02      | It's not a big deal.                                                                                |
| 43:03      | It's not like somebody can listen to this, I don't know, the transfer to the servers encrypted      |
| 43:10      | and everything.                                                                                     |
| 43:11      | So it's not really bad.                                                                             |
| 43:14      | It's just not a good look.                                                                          |
| 43:16      | So you shouldn't do it on somebody else's computer.                                                 |
| 43:20      | No, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 43:21      | Don't do it on somebody else's computer, right?                                                     |
| 43:23      | That's really all it is.                                                                            |
| 43:24      | And what you can do with the API is you can have an authentication token in the header,             |
| 43:32      | basically.                                                                                          |
| 43:33      | It's not that big a deal.                                                                           |
| 43:34      | It's just something that you should have if you have an API is have authentication in               |
| 43:39      | the header, not in the URL.                                                                         |
| 43:42      | And in this case, it's a token you can revoke at any time.                                          |
| 43:46      | And you can, so you could, I don't really know if anybody would need this, but you could            |
| 43:50      | set up multiple access tokens to your notifications, use them for different systems.                |
| 43:57      | And if any one of those systems for whatever reason was compromised and somebody has your           |
| 44:01      | access token, you can just disable this one token and everything else will still work.              |
| 44:06      | If the secret in the URL, like the URL comes with this password encoded, and once that's            |
| 44:13      | compromised for whatever reason, you can't just reset it in the app and say, hey, somebody          |
| 44:19      | sending me notifications, I don't want this.                                                        |
| 44:21      | You tap reset and everything's, you have a new secret and the old one is just no longer             |
| 44:27      | valid.                                                                                              |
| 44:28      | But that would kind of break all your notifications you do like this.                               |
| 44:32      | So I'm not sure.                                                                                    |
| 44:33      | The average user, if the word API doesn't get you excited, you don't have to, you don't             |
| 44:39      | have to go there.                                                                                   |
| 44:40      | It's fine.                                                                                          |
| 44:41      | But if web API is what makes your heart goes faster, there is an API, you can do things             |
| 44:46      | with it.                                                                                            |
| 44:47      | It's pretty cool.                                                                                   |
| 44:48      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 44:49      | And this is also advantageous if you're writing your own code and then you do what you're           |
| 44:53      | not supposed to do, which is accidentally commit your authorisation token to Git.                   |
| 44:58      | And then it's publicly on your GitHub profile and somebody can wander along and just see            |
| 45:01      | it.                                                                                                 |
| 45:02      | And add a note in the readme that it is a sample token that does not work.                          |
| 45:07      | Not that this has ever happened to me with any service at all.                                      |
| 45:10      | That sounds like the voice of experience.                                                           |
| 45:14      | Pretty much every programmer has accidentally committed something to a repository or a version      |
| 45:19      | control at some point that they should not be that a database password or an authorisation          |
| 45:24      | token something.                                                                                    |
| 45:25      | But at some point these things, if you're writing code from scratch, you're going to                |
| 45:30      | put it somewhere that you didn't intend to put it, and then it's nice to have that option           |
| 45:33      | to kill the authorisation token and to generate a new one.                                          |
| 45:37      | Because then it doesn't mean that your mistake is the end of your PushCut experience.               |
| 45:41      | Now, Simon, you added a feature recently.                                                           |
| 45:44      | In fact, it's one of the main reasons I want to have you on the show, because I think it's          |
| 45:47      | just so useful, is the Apple Watch integration.                                                     |
| 45:50      | Why don't you talk us through that?                                                                 |
| 45:52      | You know, I love the Apple Watch.                                                                   |
| 45:54      | I have for years.                                                                                   |
| 45:57      | But for this app, I didn't really feel the originally it ran shortcuts, and it would                |
| 46:03      | open other apps through the URLs, right?                                                            |
| 46:05      | That's what you would do.                                                                           |
| 46:07      | And both of these things don't work on the Apple Watch.                                             |
| 46:10      | So sadly, I just felt, well, not this time, maybe with the next step I do, I'll make something      |
| 46:16      | more watch-friendly.                                                                                |
| 46:18      | But then I started adding online actions where you can trigger Zapier or [[Make\|Integromat]] directly.       |
| 46:25      | And now Microsoft Flow is added, so you can connect those systems.                                  |
| 46:28      | And with the tap of a button, you can run something in Zapier directly.                             |
| 46:34      | And you can do that on the watch.                                                                   |
| 46:35      | That works.                                                                                         |
| 46:36      | And then I added the [[HomeKit]] scenes where you can, with the tap of a button, run a [[HomeKit]]          |
| 46:43      | scene directly.                                                                                     |
| 46:44      | And you can do that on the watch.                                                                   |
| 46:46      | And then just to make things complete, I added the background URL support, basically, mainly,       |
| 46:52      | to be able to trigger ifs, if webhooks directly.                                                    |
| 46:56      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 46:57      | And that works on the watch.                                                                        |
| 46:58      | And then I just felt, well, now I've got a package, and it was a pleasure doing [[SwiftUI]]         |
| 47:02      | on the watch, really.                                                                               |
| 47:03      | It's the first time I did [[SwiftUI]], too.                                                         |
| 47:05      | It's really fun.                                                                                    |
| 47:07      | And Rose, you said that you think the notifications look great with the emoji and everything.       |
| 47:12      | I love how it feels on the watch.                                                                   |
| 47:14      | I think on the watch it's just, I don't know, what it's about.                                      |
| 47:17      | I think the blackness of it, I don't know.                                                          |
| 47:19      | It's even prettier on the watch if you have the little notifications with the emoji.                |
| 47:27      | It feels good.                                                                                      |
| 47:28      | And then you get the little vibration when you tap it and it works.                                 |
| 47:32      | It's good times.                                                                                    |
| 47:33      | Yes.                                                                                                |
| 47:34      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 47:35      | I have to say, the haptic feedback on the watch is very nice.                                       |
| 47:37      | And when doing something, like, for example, choosing which scene it is that you want to            |
| 47:41      | run at 9 PM at night, it does just give you that little feeling of satisfaction.                    |
| 47:48      | Because maybe this is just the automation nerd in me talking, but I really like tapping             |
| 47:52      | buttons and then stuff just happens.                                                                |
| 47:55      | I'm like a little kid at Christmas.                                                                 |
| 47:57      | So yeah.                                                                                            |
| 47:58      | That's me.                                                                                          |
| 47:59      | You and me both.                                                                                    |
| 48:01      | Well, it's also just such an obvious use case for an app like this, where the app push cut          |
| 48:08      | is in a lot of ways a very fancy trigger.                                                           |
| 48:10      | And so wouldn't that make sense if you walk in the front door and you get a little tap              |
| 48:16      | on your wrist and you look down and then you choose what light set up or what music you             |
| 48:19      | want to play or whatever.                                                                           |
| 48:22      | And it's great.                                                                                     |
| 48:23      | It just does a good job of it and it just seems like such a natural fit.                            |
| 48:27      | As soon as I saw it, I'm like, oh, that's obvious.                                                  |
| 48:29      | I hadn't really thought about it in terms of push cut.                                              |
| 48:31      | But now that I have it, it's like, yes, of course, this is what we needed the whole time.           |
| 48:36      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 48:37      | And in a way, every good app does that, right?                                                      |
| 48:39      | Every good app gives you those notifications and quick interactions that you use all the            |
| 48:44      | time.                                                                                               |
| 48:45      | And that's what the watch is for, for the most part, is those quick interaction, like               |
| 48:50      | really quickly.                                                                                     |
| 48:51      | You turn your wrist and it all needs to be there and you tap the thing and needs to work            |
| 48:55      | within immediately and then you're out again.                                                       |
| 48:59      | But so many apps don't and so many situations don't give you good notifications, especially         |
| 49:05      | [[HomeKit]] again.                                                                                      |
| 49:06      | There are a few, I think, there are a few things it does, it informs you about certain              |
| 49:10      | stuff, but you certainly can't tell [[HomeKit]], I want in this situation, I want to have this          |
| 49:15      | question and that's the options I want to have.                                                     |
| 49:19      | And now with push cut and [[HomeKit]] and the watch, I think it's like a perfect trio.                  |
| 49:23      | I feel so too, like you said.                                                                       |
| 49:26      | Once you see the screenshot of the [[HomeKit]] question, hey, should we do this or that on              |
| 49:31      | the watch?                                                                                          |
| 49:32      | I think that tells you the story, like what this is for, a quick interaction you can tap            |
| 49:36      | on basically.                                                                                       |
| 49:37      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 49:38      | I mean, like you were saying earlier, it's nice that app developers, good apps will give            |
| 49:42      | you the prompts you want on the watch, but none of them let you make your own prompt,               |
| 49:47      | which is what push cut does.                                                                        |
| 49:48      | Like I can say, am I going to listen to Star Wars today or am I going to listen to jazz?            |
| 49:53      | And just like it just shows up on my watch, I tap a button and music starts playing.                |
| 49:58      | And it all happens so seamlessly that that's the kind of automation I get excited about.            |
| 50:04      | Me too.                                                                                             |
| 50:05      | I'm very glad to hear that.                                                                         |
| 50:08      | All right.                                                                                          |
| 50:09      | So Simon, share some of your favourite automation.                                                   |
| 50:12      | So maybe it's push cut, maybe it's something else, maybe it's some of your [[HomeKit]] stuff.           |
| 50:16      | We'd love to hear some of the stuff you're doing with automation.                                   |
| 50:19      | Sure.                                                                                               |
| 50:20      | So one thing I have to say ever since I started developing push cut, my automation life has         |
| 50:25      | been a mess.                                                                                        |
| 50:27      | I realised this the other day that like what people like you do, like people who talk about         |
| 50:32      | those things and from personal experience and test out things all the time and have the             |
| 50:36      | latest battles of everything, I couldn't handle my one app really.                                  |
| 50:40      | Like everything fell apart because I, you know, you're setting up test situations and               |
| 50:44      | test shortcuts and you test this and that and then you forget about it.                             |
| 50:48      | And for a screenshot, you kind of clear out this a little bit and then it was a nightmare.          |
| 50:52      | So I am like at the worst ever in terms of personal things I do with it.                            |
| 50:59      | The cobbler whose children have no shoes.                                                           |
| 51:02      | Exactly.                                                                                            |
| 51:03      | That's what it feels like.                                                                          |
| 51:05      | But I do, so one thing, depending on how legal this is, I might or might not have done the          |
| 51:11      | following.                                                                                          |
| 51:12      | I, not as much as right now, but back then I would go to McDonald's like, I don't know,             |
| 51:18      | twice a month maybe.                                                                                |
| 51:20      | And I would always go drive through here in Wells and I have this app, I guess it's everywhere      |
| 51:26      | where you can collect those points and they scan this sort of, they scan the barcode in             |
| 51:30      | the app.                                                                                            |
| 51:31      | And I never know where this app is.                                                                 |
| 51:33      | And I would always sit in the car and type in McDonald's to search for it on the phone,             |
| 51:38      | just to get the stupid app to scan the barcode.                                                     |
| 51:41      | And so that's one of the things I tried out with, with iBeacons basically.                          |
| 51:45      | And I set up a push get notification that whenever I'm at the McDonald's, and now here's            |
| 51:51      | the story.                                                                                          |
| 51:52      | When it's legal to place an iBeacon on some street sign somewhere, then I did that.                 |
| 51:56      | And if not, I set up a CHEU offense, but it worked perfectly basically.                             |
| 52:00      | And whenever I go there, you have placed iBeacons out in the world for your own use.                |
| 52:08      | I can either confirm or deny.                                                                       |
| 52:11      | I love that.                                                                                        |
| 52:13      | That is absolutely genius.                                                                          |
| 52:16      | So if that's not against some sort of law regulation, then that's a pretty good deal                |
| 52:21      | because there's a road next to the McDonald's that I drive by all the time.                         |
| 52:27      | It's a big road that you kind of drive there all the time.                                          |
| 52:30      | And it would always trigger whenever I go past it, and it didn't feel good enough.                  |
| 52:35      | So with iBeacons, you can go a lot more focused in terms of location.                               |
| 52:41      | And now I have this thing.                                                                          |
| 52:42      | Whenever I go there, my phone says, hey, should we open this app?                                   |
| 52:46      | And I say, yeah.                                                                                    |
| 52:47      | And then I just call the shortcut that opens the app.                                               |
| 52:50      | And that's that.                                                                                    |
| 52:51      | It's one of those small little things, but I don't know.                                            |
| 52:54      | That's kind of what I really like about the, I think the best automations are the ones              |
| 52:59      | that are like two steps, but it's like just the right steps at the right time.                      |
| 53:03      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 53:04      | I'm just picturing in my mind, like the gardener at McDonald's looking in the planter box           |
| 53:10      | and saying, what is this thing in the planter?                                                      |
| 53:13      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 53:14      | I mean, they're really small, right?                                                                |
| 53:16      | If you don't know where it is, you'll not find it.                                                  |
| 53:18      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 53:19      | If it's there at all.                                                                               |
| 53:20      | It's like you've just opened up a whole world to me.                                                |
| 53:22      | I'm just thinking where the place is in the world I need to put an iBeacon.                         |
| 53:27      | I suspect that David's gym will shortly be outfitted with iBeacon technology and the                |
| 53:31      | gym owners may or may not know about this.                                                          |
| 53:34      | Or even like I was thinking the supermarket is a good one because that's, this is an example        |
| 53:40      | automation gone awry using a geo location fence around my supermarket.                              |
| 53:47      | I always go to the same market all the time.                                                        |
| 53:51      | And then you go there and then the automation triggers to get you your grocery list, whatever       |
| 53:57      | it is that you need to buy.                                                                         |
| 53:59      | But the problem is, as you guys mentioned, those fences are too big.                                |
| 54:04      | And so I drive by the grocery store all the time and it's always trying to tell me to               |
| 54:08      | buy milk and I'm not actually going to the grocery store.                                           |
| 54:11      | So I'm thinking, huh, I wonder where I could put one in or very close to the grocery store.         |
| 54:20      | Unfortunately for me, I'd regularly walk past, there's three different grocery stores               |
| 54:25      | I go to on a regular basis and I regularly walk past two or three of them on the way                |
| 54:30      | home from work, depending on which way it is I'm taking home.                                       |
| 54:33      | So if I did that, then I would still get the notifications.                                         |
| 54:35      | I think I'll stick with my geo fence in that respect.                                               |
| 54:38      | Oh, but it would get even better.                                                                   |
| 54:40      | Like let's say you only get the spicy carrots at Trader Joe's, then if you had an iBeacon           |
| 54:45      | near your Trader Joe, it would only give you that.                                                  |
| 54:47      | You could have separate lists, Simon, you're causing trouble, I can already tell you.               |
| 54:53      | That only works if not everybody's doing it, I think.                                               |
| 54:55      | Well, to this way, if you live in a community where you know that there are other nerds,            |
| 55:00      | you could also share iBeacons.                                                                      |
| 55:02      | Absolutely.                                                                                         |
| 55:03      | And I'm willing to bet that there are other nerds in Orange County.                                 |
| 55:06      | There probably are, where you are as well, Simon, I'm sure there are people in Vienna.              |
| 55:10      | So if anybody's up for sharing some iBeacons.                                                       |
| 55:14      | You know, it's funny because I think the whole iBeacon thing was inventid to get places             |
| 55:19      | or stores or like museums to place them and have their apps pick up on them.                        |
| 55:25      | I believe, I think that was the original intent.                                                    |
| 55:28      | It was, I believe it was done by Apple originally to help track the flow of customers in the        |
| 55:33      | Apple Store.                                                                                        |
| 55:34      | I'm probably completely wrong on this, so I'll try and find the original information                |
| 55:37      | for the show notes.                                                                                 |
| 55:39      | But it's so that they can tell where you are in the store and give you information based            |
| 55:43      | on that.                                                                                            |
| 55:44      | Because if you've noticed, if you're like right in front of or inside an Apple store,               |
| 55:48      | whether or not you're connected to the Wi-Fi, if you have the Apple Store app installed on          |
| 55:52      | your phone, it pops up and goes, hi, welcome to XYZ Apple Store.                                    |
| 55:58      | And I'm pretty certain that that is done with iBeacons.                                             |
| 56:01      | Somebody from Apple, if you know that this is done with iBeacons and you want to write              |
| 56:04      | to me and let me know, I will not tell anybody, but I can just follow up on a future podcast.       |
| 56:10      | Because I would really like to know that, but I'm pretty certain that that's what it                |
| 56:13      | was for.                                                                                            |
| 56:14      | It's to help track people inside of stores and either provide them with more information            |
| 56:17      | or provide stores with marketing information, depending on how they choose to implement             |
| 56:22      | it.                                                                                                 |
| 56:23      | Well, just given the way it works, I would almost guarantee you it's iBeacon because                |
| 56:27      | it's such a small geofence.                                                                         |
| 56:29      | It literally happens as you walk in the front door.                                                 |
| 56:31      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 56:32      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 56:33      | And I think that's what they were meant to be.                                                      |
| 56:35      | And they're also so inexpensive, so you could just place them all over the place really.            |
| 56:39      | It's not a big deal.                                                                                |
| 56:42      | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 56:43      | But as I said before, reading through the documentation, it feels a bit like a forgotten            |
| 56:47      | technology.                                                                                         |
| 56:48      | Like, it was this big thing and then nobody really cared about it and now it's sitting              |
| 56:52      | around.                                                                                             |
| 56:53      | I mean, you can order them on [[Amazon]], but it feels a bit forgotten.                                 |

| 58:13      | Our thanks to Flatiron School for their support of the automators and Relay FM.                     |
| 58:18      | All right, Simon.                                                                                   |
| 58:20      | We've been talking about iBeacons.                                                                     |
| 58:22      | I think we've been teasing the audience.                                                            |
| 58:23      | So let's just go and do some iBeacon 101 right now.                                                   |
| 58:29      | If someone's listening and they're tempted to, I don't know, put one at their McDonald's,           |
| 58:35      | or maybe just in their office, that works too.                                                      |
| 58:38      | I mean, you're the lawyer.                                                                          |
| 58:40      | I'm pretty sure you have to ask permission.                                                         |
| 58:42      | I don't know what you're talking about.                                                             |
| 58:43      | I'm a geek right now.                                                                               |
| 58:44      | I'm not a lawyer.                                                                                   |
| 58:48      | But just how do you get started with iBeacons?                                                       |
| 58:52      | Where do you buy them and talk about the setup?                                                     |
| 58:54      | Because I really think the barrier to these things is you get one and you're not even               |
| 58:58      | sure what you're supposed to do with it.                                                            |
| 58:59      | I think you're right.                                                                               |
| 59:00      | And also, I'm not really a big expert on it.                                                        |
| 59:03      | What I did, I went to [[Amazon]], I typed in iBeacon, and I just ordered the cheapest one.                |
| 59:10      | I think it was a three-pack.                                                                        |
| 59:11      | And I did this like a year ago, and that's pretty much it.                                          |
| 59:15      | So that's all I have.                                                                               |
| 59:17      | And there are these little disks, I don't know, like a bigger coin maybe, and you put               |
| 59:25      | in a battery.                                                                                       |
| 59:26      | And the tricky part, you have to set them up once.                                                  |
| 59:29      | And I think every manufacturer has their own sort of system.                                        |
| 59:34      | But basically, there are free apps.                                                                 |
| 59:36      | I think it's, I don't know what it was called.                                                      |
| 59:39      | It's like something like *setparam*, like setparameter.                                               |
| 59:44      | And it would just connect to this iBeacon.                                                            |
| 59:45      | I don't even know.                                                                                  |
| 59:46      | I'm not so sure how.                                                                                |
| 59:47      | I don't even know what technology this is.                                                          |
| 59:49      | I think it's Bluetooth-related somehow.                                                             |
| 59:52      | So what you have to do once is you set up, you have to give it this ID, which is just               |
| 59:56      | a long text with weird characters in it.                                                            |
| 01:00:00   | And it's just a unique ID, right?                                                                   |
| 01:00:02   | It's just like a long key, if you will.                                                             |
| 01:00:06   | And that's really all you need to set.                                                              |
| 01:00:07   | There are two other values called major and minor.                                                  |
| 01:00:10   | As far as I understand, this was back then kind of inventid to help those cases where,              |
| 01:00:17   | let's say McDonald's would use them like for real, and they would have one McDonald's               |
| 01:00:21   | ID, and they could use the major and minor to maybe address their individual restaurants            |
| 01:00:27   | and maybe even the entrances.                                                                       |
| 01:00:29   | And so each door could have its own unique key, major, minor sort of identifier.                    |
| 01:00:37   | But you don't need that.                                                                            |
| 01:00:38   | All you need is the one ID.                                                                         |
| 01:00:40   | And you just set that.                                                                              |
| 01:00:41   | And the other thing you can set is the strength, the signal strength.                               |
| 01:00:48   | That's where it gets really funny, because it's not really that clean cut.                          |
| 01:00:53   | You don't set it in meters or a yard or whatever.                                                   |
| 01:00:57   | You set it in some sort of decibel signal strength, we can...                                       |
| 01:01:02   | And I'm not too...                                                                                  |
| 01:01:03   | I don't know what that means, but basically, if you Google around, you'll find a table              |
| 01:01:07   | where it says, well, if you set it to negative 70, that means roughly 10 meters.                    |
| 01:01:12   | And if you set it to this number, that means roughly 150 meters.                                    |
| 01:01:16   | And it all depends, of course, on which walls are in the middle and what the situation is.          |
| 01:01:21   | But more or less, that's what you need to set up, the one ID and the one identification             |
| 01:01:27   | string and the signal strength.                                                                     |
| 01:01:30   | And once that's set up, this thing will run for years, basically.                                   |
| 01:01:34   | And you just place it or don't somewhere next to McDonald's.                                        |
| 01:01:39   | And then you copy the ID into push cut and give it a name and say, that's now the McDonald's        |
| 01:01:44   | location.                                                                                           |
| 01:01:45   | And from that forward, it's literally the same as a GU fence.                                       |
| 01:01:51   | So even the iPhone itself treats this thing much like a GU fence.                                   |
| 01:01:55   | You can enter this region that's kind of produced by the beacon and you can leave the region        |
| 01:02:00   | produced by the beacon.                                                                             |
| 01:02:02   | That's it.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:03   | And I think that starts with iPhone 10.                                                             |
| 01:02:05   | I mean, it's not all of the iPhones that you see these.                                             |
| 01:02:08   | No, that's NFC, I think.                                                                            |
| 01:02:09   | That's way older.                                                                                   |
| 01:02:10   | Yeah, it's been around for quite a long time.                                                       |
| 01:02:13   | Because Launch Center Pro added this quite a few years ago.                                         |
| 01:02:17   | And I don't remember, but that was in the version before they did the recent update                 |
| 01:02:21   | and it was working on my iPhone years ago.                                                          |
| 01:02:24   | So I've been using this for quite a while.                                                          |
| 01:02:27   | And I've got a couple sitting around in coffee cups on my desk along with some pens and paper       |
| 01:02:32   | clips and things like that.                                                                         |
| 01:02:34   | But I have the Estimote Beacons and they are a little more expensive and they're unfortunately      |
| 01:02:39   | not available on [[Amazon]] right now, which makes them a little harder to get hold of because          |
| 01:02:43   | you have to buy them from Estimote directly and they're more set up for developers.                 |
| 01:02:48   | But they also have an NFC tag built in, which means that the one on my desk at work recently        |
| 01:02:52   | got taken out of the coffee cup and put it on my desk.                                              |
| 01:02:54   | So when I go into the region, PushCut tells me, hey, you probably want to clock in and              |
| 01:02:59   | why leave it clock out.                                                                             |
| 01:03:01   | But then when I tap it, then it runs a shortcut to help me with my time tracking at work.           |
| 01:03:06   | So I have a two and one there.                                                                      |
| 01:03:09   | And what's the software used to manage the Estimote's?                                               |
| 01:03:13   | There's an Estimote app.                                                                            |
| 01:03:15   | It is updated for the iPhone 10 size.                                                               |
| 01:03:18   | I'm not sure if they ever updated it for the Max size, but it works pretty well.                    |
| 01:03:23   | And in my case, I can replace the batteries inside of mine, which I recently had to do              |
| 01:03:26   | because I've had them for over two years.                                                           |
| 01:03:28   | And the battery life on them is approximately two years, at least on mine.                          |
| 01:03:31   | It varies depending on the device, of course.                                                       |
| 01:03:33   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:03:34   | That's the thing I liked about the Estimote's, too.                                                  |
| 01:03:35   | They were more expensive, but you can manage them from the phone.                                   |
| 01:03:39   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:03:40   | But then I'm looking online and I hadn't really thought about kind of cheap iBeacons, but           |
| 01:03:45   | you can get like two for $17.                                                                       |
| 01:03:47   | It's not super expensive.                                                                           |
| 01:03:50   | I may have to buy some more.                                                                        |
| 01:03:52   | I also have one in my suitcase, and I usually turn this automation off except when I'm traveling.   |
| 01:03:57   | But then when I'm traveling, I turn it on because A, it allows me to know where my suitcase         |
| 01:04:01   | gets near me.                                                                                       |
| 01:04:02   | And B, it lets me use my hotel room as a location.                                                  |
| 01:04:07   | And then it prompts me to do stuff like open OmniFocus for the things I intended to do when         |
| 01:04:12   | I got back to my hotel room, like installing this super large Apple Wi-Fi, for example.             |
| 01:04:17   | Which when you're traveling and you don't have data roaming because you're in the US                |
| 01:04:19   | and it's horrendously expensive, it's quite useful.                                                 |
| 01:04:22   | Now that you said that, one thing we didn't really cover, but I feel could be a value               |
| 01:04:28   | to especially listeners of this show, you can use shortcuts to schedule push cut notifications.     |
| 01:04:35   | And one thing you can do is you can use shortcuts to schedule push cut notifications when you       |
| 01:04:40   | arrive at a location which can be a beacon.                                                         |
| 01:04:44   | So I don't think anybody has really set this up, well at least nobody that has contacted            |
| 01:04:49   | me about it.                                                                                        |
| 01:04:51   | But in my brain, it was a good way maybe to have some sort of system that reads, I don't            |
| 01:04:56   | know, to-dos and you can schedule them when you arrive home or some sort of fancy way               |
| 01:05:00   | of snoozing tasks that you can connect to beacons.                                                  |
| 01:05:05   | That I think you can't really do otherwise.                                                         |
| 01:05:07   | So if you have a cool solution built with that, let me know.                                        |
| 01:05:10   | In my case, I'm using the shortcut integration to schedule notifications.                           |
| 01:05:14   | So when I clock in at work, it prompts me in eight hours to clock out because I frequently          |
| 01:05:21   | end up staying at work longer than the scheduled eight hours a day.                                 |
| 01:05:25   | And this way, I get reminded with a helpful, by the way, when you are leaving, just tap             |
| 01:05:29   | here.                                                                                               |
| 01:05:30   | But of course, when I leave the I beacon area, should I be leaving early or considerably            |
| 01:05:35   | later and I for some reason cleared out my notifications, then I get that as well.                  |
| 01:05:40   | And for me, the I beacons are extremely helpful just because I work on the sixth floor, I           |
| 01:05:45   | live on the fourth floor, geofencing is not as accurate as a small I beacon in an office.           |
| 01:05:51   | Well, I think we're going to have to do more coverage of this going forward on these.               |
| 01:05:57   | We talked about this when we first started doing the show, we just haven't got around               |
| 01:06:00   | to it yet.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:01   | But push cut in particular is a great application to use if you want to go down the I beacon        |
| 01:06:08   | rabbit hole.                                                                                        |
| 01:06:09   | Yes, it really is.                                                                                  |
| 01:06:11   | And for me, it's become one of these apps that I'm not really sure how I would live                 |
| 01:06:15   | without it because as well as using it for the automations and everything else that we've           |
| 01:06:19   | talked about on this episode, I also use it to get notifications out of things that I               |
| 01:06:22   | otherwise wouldn't necessarily get notifications out of.                                            |
| 01:06:25   | Well, for example, I've got some project management software which doesn't have iOS support and     |
| 01:06:35   | it doesn't offer I beacon, sorry, it doesn't offer push notifications, doesn't offer I              |
| 01:06:42   | beacon support as well either, surprisingly enough.                                                 |
| 01:06:45   | But it fails to send me notifications when things get assigned to me and stuff like that,           |
| 01:06:49   | which is stuff I would really like to know about, but it has support for webhooks.                  |
| 01:06:53   | And so I just set it up so that whenever something gets assigned to me, it pangs a webhook with     |
| 01:06:57   | the information it does a post and it tells me, hey, XYZ was assigned to you and then               |
| 01:07:02   | more information and when I tap on it, it opens the URL to the web application, which               |
| 01:07:06   | has been an absolute lifesaver because stuff has been being assigned to me left, right              |
| 01:07:10   | and centre.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:11   | And this way I actually know about it and I don't have to rely on email notifications               |
| 01:07:15   | and then waiting through my email inbox, which after spending a week on a training course           |
| 01:07:21   | in Germany is a rather far away from inbox zero, much further than I would like.                    |
| 01:07:28   | So Simon, what's the, well, first of all, kind of your personal story, this was a success           |
| 01:07:34   | for you and now this is your full-time gig, right?                                                  |
| 01:07:37   | I mean, it's a bit early to call it a success, like financially, and I know I'm on the Automators    |
| 01:07:44   | podcast, so I could die right now.                                                                  |
| 01:07:46   | You know what I mean?                                                                               |
| 01:07:47   | It's been great.                                                                                    |
| 01:07:48   | That sort of feedback I've been being able to speak to people like you about that.                  |
| 01:07:54   | So that's very successful if you ask me.                                                            |
| 01:07:58   | I think for a person and a family to be able to live off an app, it needs to do fantastically,      |
| 01:08:05   | not just good.                                                                                      |
| 01:08:06   | So I'm not sure where I am in this area, but it's not even been a year doing this sort              |
| 01:08:15   | of work and so it's all still possible.                                                             |
| 01:08:19   | I'm still dreaming.                                                                                 |
| 01:08:20   | I'll tell you, we're all glad you're dreaming because this is a great app and any bit that's        |
| 01:08:25   | interested in automation needs a checkout push cut.                                                 |
| 01:08:27   | You can download it for free.                                                                       |
| 01:08:29   | There is a subscription if you want to get some additional features, but even just the              |
| 01:08:34   | stuff you give away for free is really powerful.                                                    |
| 01:08:36   | So I think everybody should at least give this one a try.                                           |
| 01:08:40   | And like I said, it's an audio podcast.                                                             |
| 01:08:44   | It's a very technical subject, so I'd recommend heading over to the push cut website and taking     |
| 01:08:48   | a look at some of the examples.                                                                     |
| 01:08:51   | Another place you can go is into the forums for the Automators.                                     |
| 01:08:53   | We've got these great forums and lots of people sharing stuff there.                                |
| 01:08:58   | And give this a try.                                                                                |
| 01:08:59   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:09:00   | Thanks for saying that.                                                                             |
| 01:09:01   | Simon, where should people reach out if they want to get a hold of you?                             |
| 01:09:07   | The forums is a good place.                                                                         |
| 01:09:09   | I'm trying to be there all the time and see if anybody has a question in this area.                 |
| 01:09:16   | Of course, there's Twitter.                                                                         |
| 01:09:17   | You can find the app on Twitter.                                                                    |
| 01:09:20   | I tried to post about updates or new features there as they come out.                               |
| 01:09:25   | One thing I was just thinking about, as Rose mentioned, the situation where you want a              |
| 01:09:32   | notification eight hours after you enter a region, I'm actually working on a feature                |
| 01:09:38   | right now to have this sort of delayed location notification.                                       |
| 01:09:42   | So that might be something that you get out of the box.                                             |
| 01:09:45   | And once that version ships, I'm sure to announce it on Twitter too.                                |
| 01:09:50   | So that's a good place, I would say.                                                                |
| 01:09:51   | There's also a Reddit, so anywhere.                                                                 |
| 01:09:54   | If you Google it, you'll find it.                                                                   |
| 01:09:58   | Just a message through, I'm always happy to receive them.                                           |
| 01:10:01   | Yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:10:02   | Well, I recommend everybody download and give push, try if you haven't already got it installed.    |
| 01:10:06   | It's just a great app.                                                                              |
| 01:10:08   | And if you're interested in automation, it just opens some doors that you didn't have               |
| 01:10:12   | otherwise.                                                                                          |
| 01:10:13   | And honestly, just the way you display the options, like I said at the beginning, it's              |
| 01:10:19   | automation triggers plus options, which it's not that easy to get that in other ways.               |
| 01:10:24   | So that's worth checking out for that reason alone.                                                 |

# Show Notes
Today we venture into the brave new world of web automation, and we start with grand-daddy, [Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/home). We begin comparing and contrasting Zapier with other web automation services, like [IFTTT](https://IFTTTtt.com/discover) and [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/). 

- Did you know you can combine Zapier with [Siri Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209055)? We tell you how.  
- Next Rose explains some of the Zapier recipes we use to automate the production of Automators. (Of course … we do that.) You can even download [a clever PDF](https://david-sparks.squarespace.com/s/Automators-Zapier-Zaps.pdf) showing you exactly how we do that. 
- This show is sponsored by [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/lp/podcast), which we both love very much. 
- Next Sparky explains some basics about triggers and actions. We know this comes up often in automation, but Zapier has it's own unique snowflake way of covering that, so we explain it. Eventually, we get to Zap organisation, which makes Rose very happy. 
- Sparky uses Zapier a lot on the legal side. He has a lot of web services and Zapier lets him tie them together, particularly with client on-boarding. 
- There are a few caveats, but we are both subscribers and Zapier believers. 
- Zapier makes you happier.

| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators.                                                                               |
| 00:03      | I'm David Sparks and I'm joined by my co-host, Rose Orchard.                                                   |
| 00:07      | And this is The Automators,                                                                                    |
| 00:09      | where we talk about how to automate                                                                            |
| 00:11      | your technology to do your work for you.                                                                       |
| 00:13      | Hi, Rose.                                                                                                      |
| 00:14      | Hello, David. How are you today?                                                                               |
| 00:17      | Good. I'm kind of excited for a couple of reasons.                                                             |
| 00:20      | Number one, we have hit double digits.                                                                         |
| 00:22      | Yes, it is super exciting.                                                                                     |
| 00:24      | Happy 10th episode day.                                                                                        |
| 00:26      | Yes. More digits is always better.                                                                             |
| 00:29      | When you're making a podcast.                                                                                  |
| 00:31      | Definitely.                                                                                                    |
| 00:32      | And then, I'm also kind of excited                                                                             |
| 00:35      | because we've focused a lot on Mac, iOS and Mac OS so far.                                                     |
| 00:41      | This is an episode where we're going to focus                                                                  |
| 00:42      | on web-based automation.                                                                                       |
| 00:44      | And that was on our initial plan.                                                                              |
| 00:47      | So we finally got there.                                                                                       |
| 00:49      | And today, we're going to spend some time                                                                      |
| 00:51      | talking about [[Zapier]] and web automation in general.                                                            |
| 00:56      | Yes. And this is great because web automation, of course,                                                      |
| 00:59      | is platform-independent.                                                                                       |
| 01:00      | All it needs is internet.                                                                                      |
| 01:02      | And you don't even need to necessarily be connected                                                            |
| 01:05      | to the internet for a lot of this stuff.                                                                       |
| 01:07      | It can just happen for you.                                                                                    |
| 01:09      | And that is, of course, the pinnacle of automation,                                                            |
| 01:11      | zero involvement, and all of the automation.                                                                   |
| 01:15      | Yeah. So let's just talk about [[Zapier]] for a minute.                                                            |
| 01:17      | What is [[Zapier]]?                                                                                                |
| 01:19      | Well, [[Zapier]] is a web-based application or automation                                                          |
| 01:23      | where you can get it to do things based on stuff happening.                                                    |
| 01:28      | So I'm going to give an example that we'll                                                                     |
| 01:31      | build on later in the show.                                                                                    |
| 01:32      | Whenever we post a new episode, stuff happens.                                                                 |
| 01:35      | A lot of stuff happens, actually.                                                                              |
| 01:37      | And it happens entirely automatically,                                                                         |
| 01:39      | because in this case, [[Zapier]] is checking the [[RSS]] provided                                                     |
| 01:41      | by Relay, which is a great place to get started.                                                               |
| 01:45      | Or you could have, for example, if you are a freelancer                                                        |
| 01:49      | or a free agent, then you can have a new customer                                                              |
| 01:53      | in your invoicing software trigger things.                                                                     |
| 01:57      | Or actually, somebody could fill out a form,                                                                   |
| 01:59      | and they could ultimately become a new customer                                                                |
| 02:01      | in your invoicing software and be added to your time tracking                                                  |
| 02:04      | system, and all sorts of crazy and awesome stuff.                                                              |
| 02:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 02:07      | And the idea behind this is the internet, or just computing                                                    |
| 02:12      | in general, has become very much an internet-based practice                                                    |
| 02:17      | these days.                                                                                                    |
| 02:17      | I mean, back in the old days, when it was Mac versus PC,                                                       |
| 02:20      | everything happened on your device.                                                                            |
| 02:22      | Well, that's not so true anymore.                                                                              |
| 02:24      | A lot of the things we do are based on web services.                                                           |
| 02:28      | And [[Zapier]] is the premiere, in my opinion.                                                                     |
| 02:32      | It's the premiere service that can watch all of that stuff                                                     |
| 02:35      | for you and make things happen.                                                                                |
| 02:38      | Like, the example Rose used earlier                                                                            |
| 02:41      | was it watches an [[RSS]].                                                                                         |
| 02:43      | And if it sees a new entry in that [[RSS]],                                                                        |
| 02:46      | then a whole bunch of things can get triggered.                                                                |
| 02:47      | And [[Zapier]] is the glue that ties different web services                                                        |
| 02:52      | together.                                                                                                      |
| 02:54      | There's a couple of these types of services.                                                                   |
| 02:57      | And I think before we get into [[Zapier]],                                                                         |
| 02:58      | I just want to spend a few minutes talking                                                                     |
| 03:00      | about some of those.                                                                                           |
| 03:02      | [[Zapier]] is one we're going to focus on today.                                                                   |
| 03:04      | [[IFTTT]], which is if this, then that, is actually the first one                                                  |
| 03:09      | I was aware of.                                                                                                |
| 03:09      | Before I was even aware of [[Zapier]],                                                                             |
| 03:11      | I was using if this, then that.                                                                                |
| 03:13      | And then [[Microsoft]] has a product called [[Microsoft Power Automate\|Microsoft Flow]],                                                        |
| 03:15      | because [[Microsoft]] always has a product.                                                                        |
| 03:19      | [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] always, whatever gets big,                                                                |
| 03:21      | they make a version of that for their customers as well.                                                       |
| 03:25      | And we're probably going to talk about some of those                                                           |
| 03:27      | in the future as well.                                                                                         |
| 03:28      | We want to focus on [[Zapier]] today.                                                                              |
| 03:30      | But just for those out there, the most common question                                                         |
| 03:33      | that I always hear from people is, do I do [[IFTTT]]                                                               |
| 03:36      | or do I do [[Zapier]]?                                                                                             |
| 03:37      | And one of the things about [[Zapier]] is it costs money.                                                          |
| 03:40      | You got to pay them unless you're                                                                              |
| 03:41      | going to use it on a very small scale.                                                                         |
| 03:44      | Whereas [[IFTTT]] does not cost money, generally.                                                                  |
| 03:48      | And that's always concerned me about it, frankly.                                                              |
| 03:51      | I always felt like, how are they going to keep this thing going?                                               |
| 03:53      | But they do.                                                                                                   |
| 03:55      | But more generally, I would say [[IFTTT]]                                                                          |
| 04:00      | is the thing you do for a couple one-off things                                                                |
| 04:02      | in your personal life.                                                                                         |
| 04:04      | Connect your light bulbs to something,                                                                         |
| 04:06      | to whether the Dodgers win or something like that.                                                             |
| 04:08      | Whereas [[Zapier]] is much more of a business-focused solution.                                                    |
| 04:13      | The number of applications or web services                                                                     |
| 04:16      | that tie into [[Zapier]], according to the website this morning,                                                   |
| 04:19      | is 1,000 plus.                                                                                                 |
| 04:21      | And [[IFTTT]] just is not in that ballpark.                                                                        |
| 04:25      | The other thing about [[IFTTT]] is it only has one or two steps.                                                   |
| 04:28      | You can only do a couple things if the Dodgers win,                                                            |
| 04:31      | turn the light bulb blue.                                                                                      |
| 04:35      | Whereas with [[Zapier]], you can tie multiple services together.                                                   |
| 04:38      | And as one of the examples Rose is going to show in the show,                                                  |
| 04:43      | sure, in the show, there are a lot of things                                                                   |
| 04:46      | you can tie together with this stuff, big chains.                                                              |
| 04:49      | More triggers, more actions.                                                                                   |
| 04:50      | Even the services that are supported by [[Zapier]],                                                                |
| 04:53      | there's more you can do within those services,                                                                 |
| 04:55      | generally, than you can with [[IFTTT]].                                                                            |
| 04:58      | There's more triggers and there's more actions.                                                                |
| 05:01      | And then there's a cost to that.                                                                               |
| 05:03      | And the cost is, in Rose and our case,                                                                         |
| 05:06      | both of us have our subscribers.                                                                               |
| 05:09      | And I pay $20 a month to get these apps.                                                                       |
| 05:11      | And then you just try.                                                                                         |
| 05:13      | You know, try it for a month or two,                                                                           |
| 05:14      | if you find you're not using it, then don't continue.                                                          |
| 05:16      | But I think it's something worth checking out                                                                  |
| 05:19      | if you're interested in automation.                                                                            |
| 05:21      | Yeah, it definitely is.                                                                                        |
| 05:22      | And of course, it's not either or.                                                                             |
| 05:25      | If you're signed up for [[IFTTT]], you're not forbidden                                                            |
| 05:27      | from using [[Zapier]] or [[Zapier]], rather, and vice versa.                                                           |
| 05:30      | You know, you can use both.                                                                                    |
| 05:31      | And I do.                                                                                                      |
| 05:32      | And I'm very sure that you do as well, David.                                                                  |
| 05:34      | It's, you know, some things, if this and that works brilliantly for.                                           |
| 05:38      | And other things, it's like, OK, for this,                                                                     |
| 05:40      | I would need five [[IFTTT]] actions.                                                                               |
| 05:42      | Or I could have one [[Zapier]] Zap.                                                                                |
| 05:45      | And that's it.                                                                                                 |
| 05:46      | And that's the thing, like, when I found                                                                       |
| 05:48      | I was running out of Zaps on the free tier of [[Zapier]].                                                          |
| 05:52      | And so I upgraded to the paid tier.                                                                            |
| 05:54      | And I have, I now have less Zaps than I thought I would,                                                       |
| 05:57      | because I was actually able to combine a bunch of them together.                                               |
| 06:00      | So it's not just if this happens, do that,                                                                     |
| 06:02      | is if this happens and this is specifically applicable,                                                        |
| 06:06      | do that, that, that, that, and that as well for me, please.                                                    |
| 06:09      | And that is really, really useful.                                                                             |
| 06:11      | It almost becomes a game because they have like a thousand integrations.                                       |
| 06:15      | So you just start going in and anything                                                                        |
| 06:18      | you've ever connected a website to or used,                                                                    |
| 06:22      | you start searching and they're all there.                                                                     |
| 06:23      | I mean, OmniFocus is there, which is not a web service.                                                        |
| 06:26      | So you just start getting all these together.                                                                  |
| 06:29      | And then once you start telling                                                                                |
| 06:30      | it all the different services you use,                                                                         |
| 06:32      | it gives you ideas for how to connect them.                                                                    |
| 06:33      | That's really fun.                                                                                             |
| 06:34      | Yes, it is.                                                                                                    |
| 06:35      | And of course, with [[OmniFocus]] in this case,                                                                    |
| 06:37      | they're using the mail drop.                                                                                    |
| 06:38      | But with other things like, I don't know,                                                                      |
| 06:40      | if you use Harvest for invoicing, for example,                                                                 |
| 06:43      | then you can actually connect directly to their API                                                            |
| 06:46      | if they have one.                                                                                              |
| 06:47      | And of course, [[Zapier]] has done all of the abstraction for you.                                                 |
| 06:51      | You don't need to be like, OK, so what parameters                                                              |
| 06:53      | do I need to send them to get this information?                                                                |
| 06:55      | It's a case of you get the form and you just put in the information                                            |
| 06:58      | that you want, where you can use variables, things                                                             |
| 07:01      | that you've got from previous steps.                                                                           |
| 07:03      | And you can use things from multiple previous steps,                                                           |
| 07:05      | which is where stuff gets really, really nice.                                                                 |
| 07:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 07:10      | So maybe where we start that, well, actually,                                                                  |
| 07:14      | let's talk about the connection with [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] too,                                                       |
| 07:17      | because there is one, believe it or not.                                                                       |
| 07:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 07:19      | So you might be thinking, what?                                                                                |
| 07:20      | Wait, I have not seen [[Zapier]] in [[Shortcuts]].                                                                     |
| 07:23      | And that's probably because it is hiding under a very cunning                                                  |
| 07:27      | little thing called *Get Contents of URL*.                                                                       |
| 07:29      | Because with Shortcuts, with that particular action,                                                           |
| 07:32      | you can do get and post requests.                                                                              |
| 07:35      | And in [[Zapier]], there is this great action called a [[Webhook]],                                                    |
| 07:38      | where if, for example, you want to connect to something that                                                   |
| 07:41      | doesn't have native interaction with [[Zapier]],                                                                   |
| 07:45      | then you can create a [[Webhook]].                                                                                 |
| 07:47      | But you can use this as a trigger as well as an action.                                                        |
| 07:51      | So you can actually create a [[Webhook]] and say, OK, right,                                                       |
| 07:54      | if I send you this information, I want you to do that.                                                         |
| 07:56      | And it will give you then the information                                                                      |
| 07:58      | that you need to put into [[Shortcuts]]                                                                            |
| 08:00      | to make it into a shortcut triggerable action.                                                                 |
| 08:03      | So you can then, I don't know, grab a bunch of data together.                                                  |
| 08:07      | Is the sun shining?                                                                                            |
| 08:09      | And is the moon blue?                                                                                          |
| 08:10      | And do I have cheese in my fridge?                                                                             |
| 08:12      | If yes, then run the [[Zapier]] zap for me                                                                         |
| 08:15      | until how much cheese is in my fridge                                                                          |
| 08:17      | and how much more I should buy, for example.                                                                   |
| 08:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 08:21      | You always need more cheese, always.                                                                           |
| 08:23      | Always need more cheese.                                                                                       |
| 08:24      | I've got some brie in the fridge right now,                                                                    |
| 08:25      | and it is calling my name.                                                                                     |
| 08:26      | It is very tasty.                                                                                              |
| 08:29      | And [[IFTTT]] has the [[Webhook]] stuff too,                                                                           |
| 08:31      | which is like the way people are controlling their Nest                                                        |
| 08:34      | thermostat with Siri now, is using the [[Webhook]]                                                                 |
| 08:37      | into the [[IFTTT]] back end.                                                                                       |
| 08:40      | So this stuff is actually quite powerful                                                                       |
| 08:42      | once you start digging into it.                                                                                |
| 08:44      | And I thought it would be fun just                                                                             |
| 08:46      | to share some of the ways we're using [[Zapier]].                                                                  |
| 08:49      | And by the way, for the years, I called it [[Zapier]].                                                             |
| 08:52      | There are, I don't know how many MPU episodes there                                                            |
| 08:54      | are, I call it [[Zapier]].                                                                                         |
| 08:55      | Someone from the company eventually emailed me and said,                                                       |
| 08:58      | no, it's [[Zapier]].                                                                                               |
| 08:59      | We're zapping.                                                                                                 |
| 09:00      | We do zaps, and that's [[Zapier]].                                                                                 |
| 09:01      | So I have the official word that that's                                                                        |
| 09:04      | how you're supposed to say the name.                                                                           |
| 09:06      | Well, that's always good to know.                                                                              |
| 09:07      | So it is [[Zapier]], and that makes us happier, right?                                                             |
| 09:10      | Oh, wow.                                                                                                       |
| 09:11      | You know what, Rose?                                                                                           |
| 09:12      | We should get money for that, I think.                                                                         |
| 09:15      | Well, if anybody's working at [[Zapier]]                                                                           |
| 09:18      | wants to buy that from me, well, go ahead.                                                                     |
| 09:22      | Well, I thought what might be fun to do in this episode,                                                       |
| 09:25      | it being episode 10 and all our first episode                                                                  |
| 09:27      | in double digits, it might be fun to lift the curtain                                                          |
| 09:30      | on automators a little bit and tell you                                                                        |
| 09:32      | some of the ways that we're automating the show using [[Zapier]].                                                  |
| 09:35      | What do you think about that, David?                                                                           |
| 09:36      | I think we should absolutely do that.                                                                          |
| 09:38      | Let's just share everything.                                                                                   |
| 09:41      | OK, well, when I started preparing the show outline,                                                           |
| 09:44      | I believe I had six different [[Zapier]] zaps.                                                                     |
| 09:46      | And as I was going through the show outline,                                                                   |
| 09:48      | I was there going, wait a minute, I could consolidate this.                                                    |
| 09:51      | Wait, I can make this better.                                                                                  |
| 09:53      | Wait, I can add these three things together.                                                                   |
| 09:55      | And now I'm down to three zaps.                                                                                |
| 09:57      | And that is audio, video, and blog posts.                                                                      |
| 10:00      | So we do screencasts to accompany these episodes, which                                                        |
| 10:04      | are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com) and [learn.macsparky.com](https://learn.macsparky.com).                                                              |
| 10:07      | And also, every episode has an accompanying blog post,                                                         |
| 10:10      | either on [my blog](https://rosemaryorchard.com) or on [David's blog](https://macsparky.com).                                                                          |
| 10:13      | So we actually offer a consolidated [[RSS]]                                                                        |
| 10:16      | feed for those of you that didn't know,                                                                        |
| 10:18      | which is available on [automators.fm](https://automators.fm).                                                                           |
| 10:21      | And so I wanted to put all of this together somehow.                                                           |
| 10:26      | And of course, the very first thing that we have to do                                                         |
| 10:28      | is we've got to start with the audio, right?                                                                   |
| 10:30      | Because what's a podcast without audio doesn't exist.                                                          |
| 10:33      | So I wait until the audio goes up,                                                                             |
| 10:35      | and that happens in the relay.fm [[RSS]] feed.                                                                     |
| 10:38      | And then the first thing I do is I                                                                             |
| 10:40      | tweet the URL from the [automators.fm](https://automators.fm) account.                                                                  |
| 10:44      | Then I use a [[Webhook]] to talk to [[Discourse]] to the forums                                                       |
| 10:49      | and to make the forum post.                                                                                    |
| 10:52      | Then I make a blog post on the Automators website                                                              |
| 10:55      | about the audio.                                                                                               |
| 10:56      | I schedule a tweet to the forum post,                                                                          |
| 10:59      | and I put that at the top of the buffer feed.                                                                  |
| 11:03      | So that will go up usually Saturday afternoons.                                                                |
| 11:06      | And then I add the forum post to our feedback document for us                                                  |
| 11:09      | so that when we are looking to include some feedback                                                           |
| 11:12      | in the show, we can find all the links immediately.                                                            |
| 11:15      | Of course, it is a subsection of the forum.                                                                    |
| 11:18      | So that is one trigger results in one, two, three, four,                                                       |
| 11:21      | five actions, which I don't need to think about.                                                               |
| 11:25      | That can happen while I'm asleep.                                                                              |
| 11:26      | It occasionally does if I go to bed early or if the episode                                                    |
| 11:31      | is going up.                                                                                                   |
| 11:32      | And I just get a notification afterwards                                                                       |
| 11:35      | with push bullet, which is the sixth action,                                                                   |
| 11:37      | to tell me that it all happened, which is really, really nice.                                                 |
| 11:40      | Yeah, because Rose and I are on different sides                                                                |
| 11:42      | of the planet.                                                                                                 |
| 11:43      | So if I post the episode while she's asleep,                                                                   |
| 11:46      | [[Zapier]] takes care of all this back-in stuff for us.                                                            |
| 11:50      | And I don't have to do it, and Rose doesn't have to do it.                                                     |
| 11:52      | The computers do it, which is great.                                                                           |
| 11:54      | Yes, it is.                                                                                                    |
| 11:55      | Because otherwise, we would post the episode,                                                                  |
| 11:58      | and one of us might forget to put up the forum post,                                                           |
| 12:00      | or maybe we'd forget to tweet it,                                                                              |
| 12:01      | or we wouldn't remember that, hey,                                                                             |
| 12:03      | we should probably tweet an episode to the discussion thing                                                    |
| 12:06      | in the forum so that more people can contribute,                                                               |
| 12:08      | or we're doing a feedback episode.                                                                             |
| 12:11      | Where did episode nine go?                                                                                     |
| 12:13      | Where is episode nine?                                                                                         |
| 12:14      | Did episode nine happen?                                                                                       |
| 12:15      | Yes, it did two weeks ago.                                                                                     |
| 12:17      | It was a very good one.                                                                                        |
| 12:17      | You'll enjoy it.                                                                                               |
| 12:18      | Go back and listen.                                                                                            |
| 12:20      | We don't need to think about any of this.                                                                      |
| 12:22      | And of course, if we come up with ideas in the future,                                                         |
| 12:24      | that we want to incorporate in this,                                                                           |
| 12:27      | that whenever a new audio post goes up,                                                                        |
| 12:29      | then we can add that as well.                                                                                  |
| 12:31      | And it's very easy to do.                                                                                      |
| 12:35      | Do you find yourself sometimes wanting                                                                         |
| 12:37      | to sign up for services simply because you                                                                     |
| 12:39      | can find a way to use it with [[Zapier]]?                                                                          |
| 12:41      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 12:42      | Thanks, me too.                                                                                                |
| 12:44      | I do that quite a bit at the moment, I have to say.                                                            |
| 12:47      | But hey, that must be good marketing, right?                                                                   |
| 12:50      | I'm still in the exploratory phase,                                                                            |
| 12:52      | because I just subscribed a few months ago,                                                                    |
| 12:54      | and I've been using it.                                                                                        |
| 12:55      | And it's like every time I go in,                                                                              |
| 12:57      | I find another way to make something easier in my life.                                                        |
| 13:00      | And I'll talk about some of the stuff                                                                          |
| 13:02      | I do with it later as well.                                                                                    |
| 13:04      | I also want to talk about the ideas of triggers and actions.                                                   |
| 13:08      | But before that, I want to take a minute                                                                       |
| 13:10      | to talk about the sponsor of this show.                                                                        |
| 13:12      | This episode of The Automators is sponsored by friends                                                         |
| 13:15      | over at Smile, and specifically, TextExpander.                                                                 |
| 13:18      | TextExpander is the ultimate automation tool,                                                                  |
| 13:22      | because we all spend time writing text on our devices,                                                         |
| 13:25      | and we don't want to be writing the same thing over and over                                                   |
| 13:29      | and over again.                                                                                                |
| 13:30      | And that's the problem TextExpander solves.                                                                    |
| 13:33      | It helps you communicate smarter.                                                                              |
| 13:35      | Now, you've heard about these text expansion apps                                                               |
| 13:38      | for a long time, where you type in some short phrase,                                                          |
| 13:42      | and it puts your cell phone number or your email address in.                                                   |
| 13:45      | And TextExpander does all that brilliantly.                                                                    |
| 13:47      | But TextExpander goes so much deeper.                                                                          |
| 13:49      | I mean, if you're listening to The Automators,                                                                 |
| 13:51      | TextExpander is your text expansion tool,                                                                       |
| 13:54      | because they do things like allow you to automatically insert                                                  |
| 13:57      | the date and time.                                                                                             |
| 13:58      | Like, I keep a running list for my day job,                                                                    |
| 14:01      | for my matters I'm doing as a lawyer.                                                                          |
| 14:03      | Every time someone gets on the phone with me,                                                                  |
| 14:05      | I go in there and add a log.                                                                                   |
| 14:06      | And I type XDTS, and it's the date and time string.                                                            |
| 14:10      | And it puts in the current date and the time.                                                                  |
| 14:13      | And TextExpander does all that for me.                                                                         |
| 14:15      | I don't have to look at a calendar or my watch.                                                                |
| 14:17      | I just type those letters, and bloop, it puts there,                                                           |
| 14:20      | and then I can type underneath it.                                                                             |
| 14:22      | The other thing I like about TextExpander is email.                                                            |
| 14:24      | I get a lot of email because of the products I sell,                                                           |
| 14:27      | the Siri Shortcuts field guide, et cetera.                                                                  |
| 14:30      | And so people send in, there's a lot of common questions.                                                      |
| 14:32      | Well, I have TextExpander snippets for them.                                                                   |
| 14:35      | But because it's TextExpander, they're more powerful.                                                          |
| 14:38      | I can include the tab key.                                                                                     |
| 14:40      | So I can run the snippet in the subject line of the email.                                                     |
| 14:43      | It fills in a subject line, then it tabs down to the body.                                                     |
| 14:46      | And I can embed an [[AppleScript]] in there,                                                                      |
| 14:48      | so it gets the person's name from the email                                                                    |
| 14:51      | and puts it, it says hi, and then insert name Rose, right?                                                     |
| 14:55      | Because it gets it from the thing I'm running an [[AppleScript]].                                                 |
| 14:58      | And I can insert data, and I can copy things                                                                   |
| 15:01      | from the clipboard, and it'll drop into the email.                                                             |
| 15:04      | It's just like way more powerful than anything                                                                 |
| 15:06      | you can do with a built-in text expansion.                                                                      |
| 15:08      | So TextExpander is the automator tool.                                                                         |
| 15:11      | And I think it's a great solution if you find yourself                                                         |
| 15:14      | sitting at that keyboard for any amount of time.                                                               |
| 15:17      | They're a great group of people.                                                                               |
| 15:18      | They agreed to sponsor the show before we even made an episode.                                                |
| 15:21      | We told them what we were doing.                                                                               |
| 15:22      | They're like, oh, we really like you guys.                                                                     |
| 15:24      | We want to see you make this work.                                                                             |
| 15:26      | We want to sponsor.                                                                                            |
| 15:27      | So we thank TextExpander.                                                                                      |

| 15:39      | How's that for a good deal?                                                                                    |

| 15:45      | And thank you, TextExpander, for all your support.                                                             |
| 15:48      | All right.                                                                                                     |
| 15:48      | So should we continue and keep lifting the curtain                                                             |
| 15:51      | and show people how we automate some of the video                                                              |
| 15:54      | in the blog post as well?                                                                                      |
| 15:56      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 15:57      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 15:57      | And let's kind of tie into this.                                                                               |
| 15:59      | Because we keep using the word triggers and actions.                                                           |
| 16:01      | We haven't really explained what they are.                                                                     |
| 16:03      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 16:04      | And so the trigger for the video one                                                                           |
| 16:07      | is that a new video gets posted on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@automators56).                                                        |
| 16:10      | And that means that when this happens,                                                                         |
| 16:13      | then it's going to go off and do stuff.                                                                        |
| 16:15      | And there are basically two kinds of triggers.                                                                 |
| 16:18      | There's the ones where something will just happen instantly                                                    |
| 16:21      | because something pokes [[Zapier]] and says, hello, I'm ready.                                                     |
| 16:25      | And there's the one where [[Zapier]] sits there                                                                    |
| 16:27      | and it waits for a little while.                                                                               |
| 16:28      | And then it goes and it checks if something's happened for you.                                                |
| 16:31      | And the ones, [[RSS]] feeds, new videos in the YouTube channel,                                                    |
| 16:35      | that's the ones where [[Zapier]] goes and checks.                                                                  |
| 16:37      | So you can have a delay depending on what account you have.                                                    |
| 16:39      | That could be anything from just a minute or two to 15 minutes.                                                |
| 16:45      | But you won't ever be waiting for hours unless you've somehow                                                  |
| 16:48      | set up a Zap that isn't quite right.                                                                           |
| 16:51      | So in this case, we post videos to the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@automators56)                                                        |
| 16:55      | when the episode goes live.                                                                                    |
| 16:56      | And whenever [[Zapier]] notices that they're there,                                                                |
| 17:00      | then it posts a forum thread for each video.                                                                   |
| 17:03      | So if you don't want to comment on [[YouTube]],                                                                    |
| 17:07      | maybe you've spotted it on learn.macsparky here                                                                  |
| 17:09      | because the videos go up there as well,                                                                        |
| 17:11      | then you can talk about it in our forums.                                                                      |
| 17:14      | You're very welcome to do that.                                                                                |
| 17:15      | And of course, it adds the video links and titles to [[Buffer]].                                                   |
| 17:20      | And it puts it at the bottom.                                                                                  |
| 17:22      | But this then ties back into the audio post that I mentioned                                                   |
| 17:25      | because the audio post, the forum link, the forum post                                                         |
| 17:29      | that it creates, it puts the link to that tweet                                                                |
| 17:34      | or the link to that post as a tweet at the top of [[Buffer]],                                                      |
| 17:36      | which means it will definitely be the next one that goes out.                                                  |
| 17:39      | But videos can go out a bit later in the week                                                                  |
| 17:41      | to remind people that we have videos.                                                                          |
| 17:43      | Maybe you listened to the episode over the weekend                                                             |
| 17:45      | and you didn't get a chance to look at the videos.                                                             |
| 17:48      | And so those go at the bottom so they can go out a bit later.                                                  |
| 17:51      | And then, of course, it makes a blog post about that as well.                                                  |
| 17:55      | Yeah, I just love the idea of the computers                                                                    |
| 17:56      | watching for something.                                                                                        |
| 17:58      | You know, what makes more sense?                                                                               |
| 18:01      | Hire somebody to sit there and just watch the website.                                                         |
| 18:03      | Did it go up now?                                                                                              |
| 18:05      | How about now?                                                                                                 |
| 18:06      | How about now?                                                                                                 |
| 18:06      | You don't have to do that with these services.                                                                 |
| 18:09      | And you use that type of trigger with both of the ones                                                         |
| 18:12      | we're talking about, because the first one is an [[RSS]] entry                                                     |
| 18:16      | over at Relay when we post the episode.                                                                        |
| 18:18      | The second one is an entry over at [[YouTube]]                                                                     |
| 18:21      | when we post a new video.                                                                                      |
| 18:22      | And then just make a list of all the things                                                                    |
| 18:24      | you want to have happen and tie these together.                                                                |
| 18:28      | And we're going to do a screencast for this episode                                                            |
| 18:30      | so you'll be able to see it.                                                                                   |
| 18:31      | But tying them together is really just clicking a few buttons                                                  |
| 18:36      | and zap here.                                                                                                  |
| 18:37      | Yes, it is.                                                                                                    |
| 18:38      | It's really, really simple.                                                                                    |
| 18:39      | And of course, if you have the paid account,                                                                   |
| 18:41      | then you can actually even add ifs.                                                                            |
| 18:43      | So for example, our next post, which is our blog posts.                                                        |
| 18:47      | So it's David or I each taken episode.                                                                         |
| 18:51      | This is episode 10.                                                                                            |
| 18:52      | So this is David's episode.                                                                                    |
| 18:53      | But I don't want to be sitting there waiting for David                                                         |
| 18:56      | to post his episode so I can put a blog post up                                                                |
| 18:58      | on the automated blog or making him do that extra step as well.                                                |
| 19:03      | This is starting to sound like a lot of work, something                                                        |
| 19:05      | that you might hire an assistant to do.                                                                        |
| 19:07      | Well, instead, I have it checked.                                                                              |
| 19:09      | And it actually checks both of our blogs.                                                                      |
| 19:12      | And whenever it's got a post in it                                                                             |
| 19:13      | with the word automators in the title,                                                                         |
| 19:17      | then it will actually send it to a custom API                                                                  |
| 19:20      | that I built for the blog, which checks in the back end.                                                       |
| 19:25      | And it goes, OK, is this supposed to be David's episode                                                        |
| 19:28      | or Rose's episode?                                                                                             |
| 19:29      | Right?                                                                                                         |
| 19:29      | OK, it's David's episode.                                                                                      |
| 19:31      | So I'm going to put that up.                                                                                   |
| 19:32      | Or no, this is Rose's episode.                                                                                 |
| 19:34      | And this is David's blog post.                                                                                 |
| 19:35      | So I'm not going to put that up.                                                                               |
| 19:36      | And it's limited as well.                                                                                      |
| 19:38      | So it only works on the day that the episode is supposed                                                       |
| 19:42      | to go up.                                                                                                      |
| 19:43      | So if something happened, then, and David posted,                                                              |
| 19:46      | I don't know, four days later, then                                                                            |
| 19:48      | I would have to manually intervene and make sure                                                               |
| 19:50      | that that post goes up.                                                                                        |
| 19:51      | But we're not planning on that at any rate.                                                                    |
| 19:54      | Yeah, so now, what about the, how do you do the if?                                                            |
| 19:57      | If it's mine or yours, what are you looking at?                                                                |
| 20:00      | That is something that I have got                                                                              |
| 20:03      | written into the API that I wrote.                                                                             |
| 20:05      | So the API that I wrote, I use [[PHP]] a lot in my day jobs.                                                       |
| 20:08      | So I just threw something together on [[PHP]].                                                                     |
| 20:11      | And it just checks in the back end.                                                                            |
| 20:12      | There's a database where I've stored                                                                           |
| 20:15      | that this episode is supposed to be mine                                                                       |
| 20:17      | or this episode is supposed to be David's.                                                                     |
| 20:19      | And then checks.                                                                                               |
| 20:21      | And if it lines up with the blog post that it's receiving,                                                     |
| 20:24      | then it'll post it.                                                                                            |
| 20:26      | And if it doesn't, then it won't.                                                                              |
| 20:28      | And of course, I've added some authentication to this as well.                                                 |
| 20:30      | So there's no need for those hackers listening to us.                                                          |
| 20:33      | There's no need to go poking around in the back end.                                                           |
| 20:35      | You won't get anywhere.                                                                                        |
| 20:37      | And if you're curious, I do events to roast us odds.                                                           |
| 20:40      | Yes, yes.                                                                                                      |
| 20:41      | At least that's the plan.                                                                                      |
| 20:44      | At least through episode 10.                                                                                   |
| 20:46      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 20:46      | Well, it's working quite well.                                                                                 |
| 20:48      | But yeah, it's amazing.                                                                                        |
| 20:49      | Because when I was outlining this episode,                                                                     |
| 20:52      | I thought, oh, I know what I'm doing here with [[Zapier]].                                                         |
| 20:55      | I love [[Zapier]].                                                                                                 |
| 20:56      | I've been using it for quite a while.                                                                          |
| 20:57      | And I realised how much of this I could just squish together                                                   |
| 21:01      | to make it better and more efficient, which                                                                    |
| 21:04      | means I'm using less zaps.                                                                                     |
| 21:06      | I'm actually just, I mean, for automators,                                                                     |
| 21:09      | I'm using three zaps.                                                                                          |
| 21:10      | And I could probably reduce the number of zaps                                                                 |
| 21:12      | that I'm using even further to less than five if I wanted to.                                                  |
| 21:17      | But because I'm using multiple triggers,                                                                       |
| 21:21      | I need that paid plan.                                                                                         |
| 21:22      | But it is well worth it.                                                                                       |
| 21:24      | Because I think you were saying to me recently, David,                                                         |
| 21:26      | that you were considering hiring an assistant.                                                                 |
| 21:28      | And you realised you can do quite a bit of this stuff                                                          |
| 21:30      | with [[Zapier]].                                                                                                   |
| 21:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 21:32      | Well, I'll talk about that when I talk about some                                                              |
| 21:34      | of my favourite zaps.                                                                                           |
| 21:35      | But it did replace some of my assistant work,                                                                  |
| 21:37      | because I do use a lot of web services.                                                                        |
| 21:40      | And why not tie all these things together?                                                                     |
| 21:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 21:43      | But before we get to that, how many                                                                            |
| 21:45      | were you using to run automators before you                                                                    |
| 21:47      | started doing the research for the show and consolidated?                                                      |
| 21:50      | I was using 10.                                                                                                |
| 21:52      | 10 episodes, 10 zaps.                                                                                          |
| 21:54      | And now I'm using three for automators.                                                                        |
| 21:58      | So I'm using 30% of the zaps I was.                                                                            |
| 22:01      | And I actually have more actions happening now,                                                                |
| 22:04      | because I realised that I could add a bunch of stuff                                                           |
| 22:09      | as I was going through it.                                                                                     |
| 22:10      | Because I was like, oh, wait.                                                                                  |
| 22:11      | Wait, they support [[Quip]]?                                                                                       |
| 22:12      | Because we do our show notes in [[Quip]],                                                                          |
| 22:14      | which is an alternative to [[Google Docs]],                                                                        |
| 22:16      | where we can do collaborative planning.                                                                        |
| 22:18      | And yeah, so that's appending to a [[Quip]] spreadsheet                                                            |
| 22:21      | for our feedback, for example.                                                                                 |
| 22:23      | And the interesting thing is it really                                                                         |
| 22:25      | comes down to triggers, really, for your zaps.                                                                 |
| 22:27      | That's what it starts with.                                                                                    |
| 22:29      | And once you find a trigger or a weigh-in,                                                                     |
| 22:32      | then the question is, how much restraint can you show?                                                         |
| 22:35      | I mean, because there's just so many different ways.                                                           |
| 22:38      | I mean, there's no reason why Rose couldn't have also                                                          |
| 22:41      | sent herself something to the [[OmniFocus]] mail drop                                                                |
| 22:44      | to add tasks to her [[OmniFocus]] project,                                                                         |
| 22:47      | or started communicating with me directly about something.                                                     |
| 22:51      | I mean, this thing really, it is a once you                                                                    |
| 22:54      | start taking the lid off this thing,                                                                           |
| 22:56      | there is a lot you can do.                                                                                     |
| 22:57      | Oh, yeah, yeah.                                                                                                |
| 22:59      | Because you can get super crazy, it's                                                                          |
| 23:01      | quite useful to actually be able to organise your zaps.                                                        |
| 23:03      | And this is something I always struggle with if this and that.                                                 |
| 23:06      | But thankfully, [[Zapier]] has folders,                                                                            |
| 23:08      | which make me happy.                                                                                           |
| 23:09      | I like folders.                                                                                                |
| 23:10      | I'm a very organised automation nerd.                                                                          |
| 23:13      | So I have an Automators folder in [[Zapier]] now,                                                                  |
| 23:16      | where all of my automated zaps live, which is very useful.                                                     |
| 23:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 23:22      | So for me, I started on the other side of my life with [[Zapier]],                                                 |
| 23:27      | because when I signed up, I just started                                                                       |
| 23:30      | plugging in the names of all the different web services                                                        |
| 23:33      | that I use.                                                                                                    |
| 23:34      | And it was remarkable to me how many of them were on [[Zapier]].                                                   |
| 23:37      | I mean, some of the main ones that I spend a lot of time in                                                    |
| 23:41      | is a Basecamp.                                                                                                 |
| 23:43      | I'm now a Basecamp subscriber.                                                                                 |
| 23:46      | And for all of my legal clients, I just                                                                        |
| 23:49      | found it was really difficult to keep track of things.                                                         |
| 23:53      | I do a lot of contracts for clients.                                                                           |
| 23:55      | And they'd call me a year and a half later and say,                                                            |
| 23:58      | well, what about that contract we did back when?                                                               |
| 24:01      | And there's a bunch of documents on different cloud                                                            |
| 24:04      | storage, and there's a bunch of emails                                                                         |
| 24:07      | in different people's email boxes.                                                                             |
| 24:09      | And I just realised that that was a bad way                                                                    |
| 24:12      | to keep that information.                                                                                      |
| 24:13      | So I went with [[Basecamp]], partly because I just really                                                          |
| 24:17      | like the people behind it.                                                                                     |
| 24:18      | But also, it's a very user-friendly thing                                                                      |
| 24:21      | that you can bring people who aren't necessarily                                                               |
| 24:23      | automators, listeners, into [[Basecamp]], and they can figure                                                      |
| 24:26      | out very quickly.                                                                                              |
| 24:27      | But now I've got a [[Webhook]].                                                                                    |
| 24:29      | I've got a way in.                                                                                             |
| 24:30      | And then we've got different other things                                                                      |
| 24:35      | I do with web-based services.                                                                                  |
| 24:38      | And my billing service is a web-based service.                                                                 |
| 24:42      | So I started looking at all the stuff I was doing.                                                             |
| 24:45      | And when I get a new client in particular,                                                                     |
| 24:49      | there's always a bunch of steps that need to be taken.                                                         |
| 24:51      | And I have an assistant that helps me out,                                                                     |
| 24:54      | but she's really busy a lot of times with the MacSparky stuff.                                                |
| 24:57      | So when I give her something like set up a new legal client,                                                   |
| 25:00      | it takes time for her to do it.                                                                                |
| 25:02      | And I want to get a quick response to clients                                                                  |
| 25:04      | when they want to sign up.                                                                                     |
| 25:05      | I want to have everything just set up and let go.                                                              |
| 25:08      | And so I started looking into this.                                                                            |
| 25:09      | And I realised, oh, I could do all of this stuff                                                               |
| 25:12      | through [[Zapier]].                                                                                                |
| 25:13      | So what I do is, and I'm not complete with this yet,                                                           |
| 25:17      | but I create a billing entry with my billing service.                                                          |
| 25:20      | And they support [[FreshBooks]], [[Harvest]], all the big ones.                                                        |
| 25:23      | And they have triggers and actions for all of them.                                                            |
| 25:25      | So you can create a client when you create a client                                                            |
| 25:29      | or when you set up a staff member or when you add an entry.                                                    |
| 25:32      | All these things can be potential triggers or actions.                                                         |
| 25:35      | But I use the billing one because I                                                                            |
| 25:36      | want to make sure I get the information in there right.                                                        |
| 25:40      | And then a whole bunch of stuff starts happening.                                                              |
| 25:42      | It goes and it creates a base camp project for that client name.                                               |
| 25:48      | And then it can send me some stuff and [[OmniFocus]] reminders,                                                    |
| 25:53      | setting up tasks I need to do with the initial client setup                                                    |
| 25:55      | for me.                                                                                                        |
| 25:56      | And one of them it does is it can create a folder on [[Dropbox]].                                                  |
| 26:00      | Now, it cannot create a folder on [[iCloud]],                                                                      |
| 26:03      | which is where I've been doing a lot of my storage.                                                            |
| 26:05      | So my workaround for this Rose, I thought it was kind of clever,                                               |
| 26:09      | was I create the folder on [[Dropbox]].                                                                            |
| 26:10      | But it's created in a place that our old friend [[Hazel\|Hazel's]]                                                        |
| 26:14      | watching.                                                                                                      |
| 26:15      | And then [[Hazel]] just moves it over to where it belongs on [[iCloud]].                                               |
| 26:18      | So I use the cloud-based service to create the folder on [[Dropbox]]                                               |
| 26:22      | and then use my Mac automation to get that folder somewhere else.                                              |
| 26:27      | And it's just kind of fun.                                                                                     |
| 26:29      | I don't even think I'm done with this.                                                                         |
| 26:30      | I started looking into some services.                                                                          |
| 26:32      | There are some web services.                                                                                   |
| 26:34      | Like I was looking at one called Template.                                                                     |
| 26:39      | I'm sorry, it's [[Process ST]].                                                                                     |
| 26:42      | And they allow you to make form templates                                                                      |
| 26:44      | that you can put on the internet so I can have people fill it out.                                             |
| 26:46      | And then I could run all those scripts just on filling out that.                                               |
| 26:50      | So the triggering event would then be someone filling out a form                                               |
| 26:52      | rather than me going and creating an entry in the billing program.                                             |
| 26:57      | Then I was thinking, well, I don't know.                                                                       |
| 26:58      | I want to sign up for another service for this.                                                                |
| 27:00      | It's a pretty limited use.                                                                                     |
| 27:02      | But because this [[Zapier]] works so well with [[Google Sheets]]                                                       |
| 27:06      | and the Google ecosystem, I could just set up a Google Sheet for it.                                           |
| 27:11      | I'm looking for an excuse to use [[Airtable]] more.                                                                |
| 27:13      | Anna, are you an [[Airtable]] subscriber, Rose?                                                                    |
| 27:16      | I'm not a subscriber right now, though I am looking at it                                                      |
| 27:19      | because I'm getting to the edge of what a free plan will let me do                                             |
| 27:22      | with automation at any rate.                                                                                   |
| 27:24      | And so I'm thinking of getting the pay one, but I use [[Airtable]] a lot.                                          |
| 27:28      | I actually track a bunch of citations that I'm planning on using in my notes                                   |
| 27:32      | that I am writing or I'm using in my essay for my master's degree in [[Airtable]].                                 |
| 27:39      | And you just give me a great idea that I could also have various things                                        |
| 27:43      | saved to a bunch of different text files as well.                                                              |
| 27:46      | So if I end up without an internet connection again, as happened at one point,                                 |
| 27:50      | but for [[WWDC]], I was on a very long plane ride and I realised                                                   |
| 27:54      | I didn't have everything offline, which was a mistake.                                                         |
| 27:56      | And I could have them all in text folders.                                                                     |
| 27:58      | Oh my gosh, great ideas.                                                                                       |
| 28:01      | So you would do that not through [[Airtable]], you would do it through Google, correct?                            |
| 28:04      | No, I'm using [[Airtable]] for all of that because what I do,                                                      |
| 28:07      | I have shortcuts connected to [[Airtable]] and I save a bunch of stuff.                                            |
| 28:12      | It's using the Zotero API and so on, we'll have to get into that in a future show.                              |
| 28:17      | But it then sends all of the stuff to [[Airtable]] tables and saves it for me.                                     |
| 28:22      | But of course, what would be excellent is if I expanded upon that                                              |
| 28:26      | and had [[Zapier]] in the background watching what I'm doing                                                       |
| 28:30      | and perhaps even maybe poking me if I'm not doing any work.                                                    |
| 28:34      | Yeah, and I'm getting ahead of myself. [[Airtable]] is a non-length and basically database program,                |
| 28:40      | kind of spreadsheet slash database program, mainly database, I guess.                                          |
| 28:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 28:44      | And I'm not a subscriber to that either because I don't have enough people on my team.                         |
| 28:50      | It's really great for teams.                                                                                   |
| 28:52      | Most of the spreadsheet stuff I do, I just do in a number of spreadsheets                                      |
| 28:55      | because it's just I'm the only one that needs to see it.                                                       |
| 28:57      | But with [[Airtable]], you can address it through the web.                                                         |
| 29:01      | So if you're going deep in [[Zapier]], you could set it up.                                                        |
| 29:03      | And that's always thinking, well, maybe I could set up that new client thing                                   |
| 29:06      | through an [[Airtable]] entry.                                                                                     |
| 29:08      | And that's a trigger.                                                                                          |
| 29:10      | [[Zapier]] could look at [[Airtable]] and say, oh, he added a new contact to this new client thing                     |
| 29:16      | and just grab all the data out of there and then go on, create the billing program stuff,                      |
| 29:22      | create the base camp instance, send me the stuff on OmniFocus.                                                 |
| 29:25      | Do all that stuff for me just based on the creation of an [[Airtable]] entry.                                      |
| 29:29      | Man, I'm going to talk myself into an [[Airtable]] subscription if I'm not careful.                                |
| 29:33      | Well, I mean, the free [[Airtable]] plan is actually really, really generous                                       |
| 29:36      | because you still get like 1,200 records per base.                                                             |
| 29:42      | That's essentially what they call a database, but you can have multiple tables in a database.                  |
| 29:47      | So people who are familiar with [[MySQL]] or [[MongoDB]] will probably know what that means.                           |
| 29:52      | But essentially, for those people who aren't familiar with databases,                                          |
| 29:55      | that allows you to have it's like sheets in numbers or in [[Microsoft Excel\|Excel]].                                               |
| 30:01      | But a database is way more powerful because you can do queries and you can say,                                |
| 30:05      | just present me all of the data where they signed up for my law practice                                       |
| 30:10      | after November 1st or after December 1st or whenever.                                                          |
| 30:15      | But I only want the people with Smith in their surname                                                         |
| 30:17      | and I just want these three columns and I want that as a [[JSON]] plate.                                           |
| 30:20      | And you can do that.                                                                                           |
| 30:22      | And that is officially what we call in the show the rabbit hole.                                               |
| 30:24      | We just went down.                                                                                             |
| 30:25      | Yes, that is a real rabbit hole.                                                                               |
| 30:28      | And if you have not heard of [[Airtable]] before and you've been looking for a database thing                      |
| 30:32      | that you can manipulate via shortcuts and [[Zapier]] and all of that,                                              |
| 30:35      | you're welcome. [[Airtable]] is a great place to start.                                                            |
| 30:38      | It is free and fun.                                                                                            |
| 30:40      | Yeah, so let's put a pin in that and we'll do a show on that at some point in the future.                      |
| 30:44      | But getting back, so I had all these steps I was doing before I would have my assistant go and do it.          |
| 30:49      | And like I said, my assistant's really busy right now.                                                         |
| 30:53      | So I'd like to get some of this stuff done automatically.                                                      |
| 30:57      | And I am not using the assistant for that task anymore because this solves the problem faster.                 |
| 31:04      | It doesn't, you know, it's just done for me.                                                                   |
| 31:06      | I click a button and automation is there.                                                                      |
| 31:08      | Now, there is a whole bunch of stuff I need to automate on the geek side of my life                            |
| 31:12      | with the field guide stuff and with the MacSparky stuff.                                                      |
| 31:17      | And I feel like the [[Zapier]] subscription I've got is going to pay for itself very easily                        |
| 31:22      | because now I'm starting to dig deeper into that stuff.                                                        |
| 31:25      | And I think it's going to be great.                                                                            |
| 31:27      | Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things.                                                                        |
| 31:28      | If you've been thinking about it, it is $20 a month if you sign up for the monthly plan for it.                |
| 31:34      | They have a bunch of different plans.                                                                          |
| 31:36      | So there's the free plan, which is just like you only get five zaps, which are one trigger and one action.     |
| 31:44      | So if this happens, do that.                                                                                   |
| 31:46      | And it can only run 100 times a month, all of your zaps.                                                       |
| 31:50      | But we're on the starter tier, which we get 20 zaps, and you can add filters, add as many actions as you like. |
| 31:58      | And you can have these run 1000 actions a month.                                                               |
| 32:01      | And honestly, that can in some cases, like for example, your example here,                                     |
| 32:07      | that can replace something that an assistant might do.                                                         |
| 32:09      | And it feels to me like $20 a month is a very cheap assistant.                                                 |
| 32:12      | So for me, it is definitely worth it just to get this stuff automated without thinking about it                |
| 32:17      | because I'm not in the position where I could hire somebody to do this stuff for me.                           |
| 32:21      | That's way out of the budget.                                                                                  |
| 32:23      | But getting it done automatically and accurately every time is really powerful.                                |
| 32:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 32:30      | And just go in with the free tier and try it out.                                                              |
| 32:32      | Because the nice thing with the free tier is you still get access to 1000 web services.                        |
| 32:36      | And you can just see what you can build.                                                                       |
| 32:38      | And then you can make your own decision, whether it's worth subscribing to or not.                             |
| 32:41      | But it is really impressive once you start getting down it.                                                    |
| 32:46      | And honestly, for me, the subscribing was good for me                                                          |
| 32:50      | because suddenly it gave me the freedom to say, OK, I'm putting money into this.                               |
| 32:55      | I'm going to get my money back out of it.                                                                      |
| 32:57      | So it's a very good encouragement to go through and figure out how I'm going to use it.                        |
| 33:03      | And suddenly it's obvious to me that I'm going to be getting a lot of value out of this subscription.          |
| 33:09      | Yes, it is.                                                                                                    |
| 33:10      | It's one of those things where I was always zap your curious.                                                  |
| 33:14      | Let's put it that way.                                                                                         |
| 33:15      | Where I was there going, hmm, what can this really do for me?                                                  |
| 33:19      | And then I sat down and thought about it and thought, OK, what can this do?                                    |
| 33:23      | So for anybody who listens to [[Mac Power Users]] or [[Free Agents]],                                                  |
| 33:27      | those episodes get posted in the [[Mac Power Users]] and in forum.                                                 |
| 33:32      | And so there's a [[Free Agents]] subcategory there.                                                                  |
| 33:36      | And those episodes get posted by [[Zapier]] because it works really well.                                          |
| 33:41      | And it can connect to the [[Discourse]] API.                                                                       |
| 33:43      | [[Discourse]] is the forum software that we're using for automators                                                |
| 33:46      | and they are using over at [[Mac Power Users]].                                                                    |
| 33:49      | And it is extremely useful to be able to do that.                                                              |
| 33:53      | So even if there's a service that you can't find on [[Zapier]],                                                    |
| 33:57      | if they've got an API, well, you can actually use it.                                                          |
| 34:01      | It works, which is really nice.                                                                                |
| 34:03      | Yeah. And like I said, it's fun when you go in.                                                                |
| 34:07      | You just give it a list of the services you're using and it just populates with common ideas.                  |
| 34:13      | Yes.                                                                                                           |
| 34:14      | So where does [[Zapier]] fall down for you, Rose?                                                                  |
| 34:17      | Honestly, it hasn't really fallen down yet.                                                                    |
| 34:20      | There is one caveat that I should mention,                                                                     |
| 34:23      | which is if you want notifications when these things happen.                                                   |
| 34:26      | So if you're using this and that and you want to replace some things,                                          |
| 34:30      | [[Zapier]] does not have an iOS application,                                                                       |
| 34:32      | so it has no way to send you a push notification.                                                              |
| 34:34      | However, I am using push bullet for this because that has an API.                                              |
| 34:40      | I've actually connected up the Automator's API that posts our blog posts                                       |
| 34:45      | and figures out, hey, is this David's episode or my episode?                                                   |
| 34:48      | Just in case we have to swap an episode there, then it can handle all that.                                    |
| 34:53      | And then if there's an error running that, then as well as saving everything,                                  |
| 34:57      | it will actually send me a push notification to go,                                                            |
| 34:59      | hey, there was a problem, you should fix this                                                                  |
| 35:03      | and tell me what the error was and where I can find more information.                                          |
| 35:06      | So I've integrated that same thing into my [[Zapier\|Zapier's]] apps                                                       |
| 35:08      | where I need to know that they've happened.                                                                    |
| 35:11      | And you can actually even use this, this is a tip for people listening.                                        |
| 35:15      | If you want to, you can use [[URL Schemes]] with it.                                                               |
| 35:18      | So you can have it send you a notification which could open a web page                                         |
| 35:22      | or it could open an app.                                                                                       |
| 35:25      | So it can open [[OmniFocus]] to a specific perspective for me.                                                     |
| 35:28      | So actually, when David's blog post gets published,                                                            |
| 35:31      | I get reminded that I need to post my blog post                                                                |
| 35:36      | to remind people that the new episode of Automators is out                                                      |
| 35:38      | and it opens my [[OmniFocus]] perspective for Automators                                                            |
| 35:41      | when I tap on that notification.                                                                               |
| 35:44      | That's a caveat and a fall down, but also a tip holding one.                                                   |
| 35:49      | Rose, I did not know you were doing that                                                                       |
| 35:52      | and now my head is like spinning on that idea.                                                                 |
| 35:55      | That's okay, that's what happened to me earlier when you were mentioning                                       |
| 35:59      | the air table of course is connected to [[Zapier]] because I knew it.                                              |
| 36:03      | So these things like you know it and then you think about it                                                   |
| 36:05      | and then you know and you have all of these ideas                                                              |
| 36:08      | and this is why episodes come out on Fridays.                                                                  |
| 36:12      | Yeah, I know that.                                                                                             |
| 36:13      | I feel like now I need to go through and redo some things.                                                     |
| 36:17      | For me, a couple of things I wish they were better.                                                            |
| 36:19      | Rose mentioned they don't have an app and because they don't have an app,                                      |
| 36:22      | they don't have access to iOS type data.                                                                       |
| 36:25      | Yeah, [[IFTTT]] does have access to contacts and calendar and stuff.                                               |
| 36:31      | [[Zapier]] is great with the Google ecosystem.                                                                     |
| 36:33      | If you use [[Google Calendar\|Google calendars]] and Google email, I'm sorry [[Gmail]],                                                 |
| 36:37      | I called it Google email Rose, that's kind of funny.                                                           |
| 36:40      | But anyway, it's got massive access to triggers and actions through those things.                              |
| 36:45      | So that's almost a reason to use those services                                                                |
| 36:48      | if you're going to be doing a lot of [[Zapier]] stuff.                                                             |
| 36:51      | But they don't have access to, like I said earlier,                                                            |
| 36:53      | they don't have access to [[iCloud]] Drive.                                                                        |
| 36:56      | So I wish that they would make an app.                                                                         |
| 36:59      | I mean, I feel like it makes sense to me                                                                       |
| 37:01      | and even just a way to manage my Zaps from my iOS device                                                       |
| 37:05      | and more importantly, give it a conduit for me to get permission                                               |
| 37:10      | for it to access some information.                                                                             |
| 37:12      | And I think that's probably the only way they can do that.                                                     |
| 37:15      | Second thing I think that they're not very good at is home automation stuff.                                   |
| 37:18      | Yeah, yeah, that's the same.                                                                                   |
| 37:19      | [[IFTTT]] is really good at supporting all the home automation things                                              |
| 37:23      | and [[Zapier]], despite all the integrations they have,                                                            |
| 37:25      | and they have integrations with every web service you can think of,                                            |
| 37:29      | they're not very good on home automation stuff.                                                                |
| 37:31      | So as we said at the beginning of the show,                                                                    |
| 37:33      | that's why [[Zapier]] exists for a lot of us.                                                                       |
| 37:36      | You can still do that stuff over there.                                                                        |
| 37:37      | You don't have to pick one or the other.                                                                       |
| 37:40      | But boy, if you're doing anything on the web to make your living,                                              |
| 37:45      | you should take a minute to look at [[Zapier]]                                                                     |
| 37:47      | because it probably can make at least one or two things a bit faster for you.                                  |
| 37:51      | Definitely.                                                                                                    |
| 37:52      | And I would note, if there's something where [[Zapier]] is integrated with the service                             |
| 37:56      | that if this unit isn't and you want to use data from your iOS device,                                         |
| 38:01      | you could now bear in mind there will be a delay with this                                                     |
| 38:04      | and you're going to have to get this right.                                                                    |
| 38:06      | Actually use [[Zapier]] on that to find out, for example,                                                           |
| 38:08      | when you add a new reminder,                                                                                   |
| 38:10      | have it saved to something like [[Dropbox]]                                                                        |
| 38:12      | and then have [[Zapier]] watch that folder and do stuff with it,                                                   |
| 38:16      | you know, based on the data that you save there,                                                               |
| 38:18      | which is a workaround.                                                                                         |
| 38:19      | It's not a good workaround if you need things to happen really instantly                                       |
| 38:24      | or as close to instantly as possible,                                                                          |
| 38:26      | then that is a poor workaround.                                                                                |
| 38:28      | But if you just need it to happen at some point within the next 24 hours type thing,                           |
| 38:32      | then that'll work as an acceptable solution, I would say.                                                      |
| 38:36      | Not a great one.                                                                                               |
| 38:37      | Yeah, I'm not a big fan of mousetrap automation                                                                |
| 38:39      | where you've got to tie different things together because...                                                   |
| 38:42      | That's when things start to fail,                                                                              |
| 38:44      | when you've got three or four different things stuck together with duct tape                                   |
| 38:47      | and superglue, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 38:48      | Yeah, and I'm doing that with the [[Dropbox]] to [[iCloud]] thing                                                      |
| 38:52      | that I'm doing with [[Hazel]] in the background,                                                                   |
| 38:54      | but that's just because I really want that to happen                                                           |
| 38:57      | and I was willing to put up with it.                                                                           |
| 38:59      | And when you do those things, give some thoughts to number one,                                                |
| 39:02      | how much more time is it going to take to set it up?                                                           |
| 39:04      | Because sometimes making all these things work together                                                        |
| 39:07      | takes a while to troubleshoot because you're using them in ways                                                |
| 39:10      | they weren't really meant to be used.                                                                          |
| 39:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                          |
| 39:12      | And then the second thing is,                                                                                  |
| 39:13      | because you're using them in ways they weren't meant to be used,                                               |
| 39:15      | they will break at some point.                                                                                 |
| 39:17      | Yes, and then you will have to figure out what went wrong somewhere.                                           |
| 39:21      | And in some cases, it might just be that you didn't get reminded to do something                               |
| 39:25      | and you're now like paying your electricity bill                                                               |
| 39:28      | and now your electricity is not working,                                                                       |
| 39:29      | which causes even more problems.                                                                               |
| 39:31      | And then you can't fix your zap                                                                                |
| 39:33      | because you got no way to plug into the internet.                                                              |
| 39:35      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 39:37      | So yes, don't cross the streams,                                                                               |
| 39:40      | I think is generally the recommendation.                                                                       |
| 39:42      | Every so often it works out, but at the very least consider carefully.                                         |
| 39:47      | Well, we are going to do more with web-based automation going forward.                                         |
| 39:52      | We'll probably talk about [[Zapier]] again                                                                         |
| 39:54      | as we talk to some people that are power users                                                                 |
| 39:56      | and may have some really cool integrations.                                                                    |
| 39:59      | Rose and I are both kind of new in our subscription to [[Zapier]].                                                 |
| 40:03      | I feel like automators gave me the excuse I needed                                                             |
| 40:06      | to finally just really go all in.                                                                              |
| 40:08      | How did you get that impression to Rose or was it just...                                                      |
| 40:10      | Um, I'm fairly sorry.                                                                                          |
| 40:11      | When we started automators,                                                                                    |
| 40:13      | I got a [[Zapier]] pro subscription to celebrate.                                                                  |
| 40:16      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 40:17      | So I feel like this show has helped me kind of use it more                                                     |
| 40:21      | and I am going to start going deeper into [[Airtable]].                                                            |
| 40:25      | So all this stuff just kind of grows on itself.                                                                |
| 40:27      | And so I'm sure we'll be covering this more in the future.                                                     |
| 40:29      | But I'm glad we were able with the episode 10                                                                  |
| 40:33      | to get onto the web and share some thoughts about [[Zapier]].                                                      |
| 40:36      | Like I said, we release it on Friday for a reason.                                                             |
| 40:38      | So get out there this weekend, play around with [[Zapier]],                                                        |
| 40:42      | maybe sign up for the free account                                                                             |
| 40:43      | and just see what you can make it do for you.                                                                  |
| 40:46      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                               |
| 40:47      | And they have a bunch of great articles on their website as well                                               |
| 40:50      | about how to use it with [[Airtable]]                                                                              |
| 40:52      | and various other things like that.                                                                            |
| 40:54      | So if you're stuck for ideas, feel free to poke around there.                                                  |
| 40:58      | But also check the forums,                                                                                     |
| 40:59      | because I'm very sure those of you who've got lots of ideas                                                    |
| 41:02      | are going to share some of your zaps in the forums with us, please.                                            |
| 41:06      | Yes, I'm looking forward to seeing it                                                                          |
| 41:08      | and taking ideas from the listeners.                                                                           |
| 41:10      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                      |
| 41:11      | Give them all to me.                                                                                           |
| 41:12      | I want them all. I want all your ideas.                                                                        |
| 41:14      | Yeah, all of the ideas are great, please.                                                                      |

| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automator is a podcast about squeezing the marrow out of the automation                   |
| 00:07      | on your technology and making it work even harder for you.                                               |
| 00:10      | I am David Sparks, joined by my fellow automator, Rosemary Orchard.                                      |
| 00:15      | Welcome to the show, Rosemary.                                                                           |
| 00:16      | Hello, David.                                                                                            |
| 00:17      | I'm glad to be back on the show.                                                                         |
| 00:19      | I thought for a moment you weren't going to let me back there.                                           |
| 00:21      | That was a little odd, wasn't it?                                                                        |
| 00:22      | Well, either way, how are you doing?                                                                     |
| 00:25      | You released a new book with our last show.                                                              |
| 00:27      | How's that going?                                                                                        |
| 00:28      | Oh, it's going so well.                                                                                  |
| 00:29      | I'm really excited.                                                                                      |
| 00:30      | I'm really pleased that people are learning so much about shortcuts, and a lot of people                 |
| 00:33      | have emailed me tips as well, which has been really interesting to read, so I'll be incorporating        |
| 00:37      | those into an update in the future.                                                                      |
| 00:40      | Take control of shortcuts.                                                                               |
| 00:43      | From the Take Control series, we'll put a link in the show notes from your very own Rosemary             |
| 00:48      | Orchard.                                                                                                 |
| 00:49      | You all should go buy it right now.                                                                      |
| 00:50      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 00:51      | We have a guest today.                                                                                   |
| 00:52      | Welcome to the show, Tim Stringer.                                                                       |
| 00:54      | Great to be here.                                                                                        |
| 00:55      | Tim was a guest on NPU years ago, and we all know Tim as the proprietor of Learn OmniFocus.              |
| 01:01      | If you're an OmniFocus user, you should be checking that out.                                            |
| 01:04      | But Tim does a whole bunch of other stuff too, and he is a very automation savvy guy.                    |
| 01:10      | Both Rose and I have these back channel communications with Tim all the time about cool stuff he's       |
| 01:14      | doing, and we're like, we got to get this guy on the show.                                               |
| 01:17      | We're so happy you agreed to come on the show, and thanks for joining us on The Automators.              |
| 01:22      | Oh, my pleasure.                                                                                         |
| 01:23      | Yeah, I'm really looking forward to diving in deep, and automation is definitely one                     |
| 01:27      | of my favourite topics to talk about, so I think I've come to the right place.                            |
| 01:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:31      | Tim, I didn't realise until we were prepping for this show, is actually an engineer and                  |
| 01:37      | goes back with computers back to the 80s and 90s, and kind of has been down the road,                    |
| 01:43      | just like I have.                                                                                        |
| 01:44      | We're not going to bore you with the old man talk about how computers used to be 2K and                  |
| 01:48      | 4K and all that.                                                                                         |
| 01:50      | But it is interesting from an automation standpoint, because I know you've been thinking about this      |
| 01:55      | essentially your whole life.                                                                             |
| 01:56      | Yeah, and I really got in on the ground floor with technology in general, from programming               |
| 02:03      | my first HP calculator.                                                                                  |
| 02:05      | I think that was in the early 80s.                                                                       |
| 02:06      | This was one that my dad brought home from work and had a little attach printer on it,                   |
| 02:11      | and I was just in awe of this thing that's such a, I guess, a trivial piece of technology                |
| 02:17      | today, but at the time being able to write short little programs and have them output                    |
| 02:22      | information and things seemed, seemed, you know, just amazing, almost like science fiction.              |
| 02:28      | And then I got into, in high school, I was programming computers and even doing some                     |
| 02:34      | basic robotics, and that led me to do a degree in electrical engineering with a strong computer          |
| 02:39      | systems focus.                                                                                           |
| 02:41      | And I've just been completely fascinated about how all of this technology has grown up over              |
| 02:46      | the years and become more and more capable.                                                              |
| 02:48      | Back in the day, when I was an engineering student before I jumped ship and became a lawyer,             |
| 02:54      | I had a Tandy, I think it was called the PC8 or something, it was a pocket calculator.                   |
| 03:01      | And you could program, you could write basic programs in it.                                             |
| 03:06      | And I would write engineering formulas and stuff in a basic program and run programs                     |
| 03:10      | off my calculator.                                                                                       |
| 03:11      | And I thought I just had it all figured out.                                                             |
| 03:14      | Yeah, those were interesting times.                                                                      |
| 03:16      | I also wrote, if anyone still remembers, BBS systems, a friend of mine and I wrote BBS                   |
| 03:23      | for his Commodore 64 that actually, in those days, we even connected to the internet through             |
| 03:28      | an acoustic coupler, which is where you actually put the telephone onto these pads.                      |
| 03:32      | And it was just, it was just very, very into it in those days and just amazed at what could              |
| 03:41      | be done.                                                                                                 |
| 03:42      | And as I said, we were loading things off cassette drives and things not to date myself                  |
| 03:47      | too much.                                                                                                |
| 03:48      | But yeah, it's a whole new world now.                                                                    |
| 03:51      | But I think it is great to have those roots and just to really understand what's going                   |
| 03:56      | on behind the scenes and sort of the nuts and bolts that hold everything together.                       |
| 04:01      | Now what platforms are you automating on today?                                                          |
| 04:07      | There's a variety.                                                                                       |
| 04:08      | The three main ones, I've got the [[Keyboard Maestro]] has been a big favor to mine on the                   |
| 04:14      | Mac for many, many years.                                                                                |
| 04:16      | And that's, that's when I continue to, I think I'm into several hundred macros on there                  |
| 04:22      | and it just continues to deliver.                                                                        |
| 04:24      | And I'm also a big fan of Zapier, I've been using that for quite a few years at this point               |
| 04:30      | as well.                                                                                                 |
| 04:31      | And having things that happen in the web where possible without any devices being involved               |
| 04:36      | is definitely very attractive.                                                                           |
| 04:38      | I don't need to worry about leaving a Mac on or updating software and things like that.                  |
| 04:45      | And then the third is shortcuts.                                                                         |
| 04:48      | And I've been really amazed with what Apple has done with that in iOS and iPadOS 13.                     |
| 04:54      | It went far beyond what I was expecting them to do as an upgrade.                                        |
| 04:59      | And certainly watching your field guide, David got, really got the wheels moving in terms                |
| 05:04      | of exploring a whole bunch of different possibilities.                                                   |
| 05:08      | Yeah, it's crazy how far shortcuts has come.                                                             |
| 05:11      | And now they're starting, these apps are starting to show up from folks that are adding even             |
| 05:16      | additional tools.                                                                                        |
| 05:17      | I've got an update planned to cover some of these, like these toolbox like apps where                    |
| 05:23      | you've got a whole bunch of wild shortcut tools that just, it's an app for the purpose                   |
| 05:29      | of creating shortcut tools.                                                                              |
| 05:31      | It's awesome, you know.                                                                                  |
| 05:33      | And anyway, but I am super curious to hear about you talk today about how you're using                   |
| 05:39      | these things.                                                                                            |
| 05:40      | One of the interesting things and one of the reasons why I wanted you to have on the shows               |
| 05:42      | because I do know that you use a lot of web-based automation, you know, learn OmniFocus is an            |
| 05:47      | online-based business.                                                                                   |
| 05:48      | And of course, you're going to have a bunch of online tools to keep that running.                        |
| 05:53      | But we haven't had a lot of guests talk about, you know, the online-based automation and                 |
| 05:58      | where do you draw the line?                                                                              |
| 05:59      | Where do you decide something is a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script versus something that you                     |
| 06:03      | create in Zapier?                                                                                        |
| 06:04      | And I'm looking forward to hearing from you today about some of your automations and where               |
| 06:08      | you draw that line.                                                                                      |
| 06:10      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                              |
| 06:11      | And one thing I really try to differentiate is the design versus the implementation.                     |
| 06:17      | I guess coming from my engineering background is a very natural distinction to make.                     |
| 06:23      | And so I like the kind of the creative freedom of saying, wouldn't it be nice if I could                 |
| 06:27      | do X without getting caught up in, well, this is going to be a lot of work or I don't even               |
| 06:33      | know if this is technically possible or something like that.                                             |
| 06:35      | So just giving myself the freedom to say, okay, this is the result I want to produce,                    |
| 06:42      | even taking into account different scenarios where I'd like to behave differently depending              |
| 06:46      | on where I'm physically located or what time of day it is or something like that.                        |
| 06:51      | And then once I have a clear picture of what I want to create, it's much easier to decide,               |
| 06:56      | okay, what are the tools in my toolbox that are going to facilitate this?                                |
| 07:02      | And sometimes I might say, okay, this is definitely something to do in Zapier or [[Keyboard Maestro]]        |
| 07:06      | or shortcuts.                                                                                            |
| 07:09      | And what I've been doing more and more recently is actually creating automations that combine            |
| 07:13      | the tools.                                                                                               |
| 07:15      | So there might be, I can talk about one in a moment about a shortcut that triggers a                     |
| 07:21      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] automation on the Mac and kind of gives me the best of both worlds.                     |
| 07:26      | So, but I think that's a key distinction is just coming up with the concept of what you                  |
| 07:31      | want to build, get creative, don't let the implementation details bog you down.                          |
| 07:37      | And then say, once you have that, is this possible to build the way I want it?                           |
| 07:41      | And sometimes it's like 80% of the way there, maybe there's some features that are missing               |
| 07:46      | in shortcuts or something like that.                                                                     |
| 07:47      | But at least that plan is in place and you have a design that can be implemented to some                 |
| 07:53      | extent right now, and then maybe fully a year or two down the road once the tools catch                  |
| 07:58      | up.                                                                                                      |
| 07:59      | Can you tell us a little bit more about how you actually go about designing these?                       |
| 08:03      | Do you sit down with a pen and paper, or do you just map it out in your head?                            |
| 08:08      | You know, where do you get started with coming up with the design of an automation?                      |
| 08:13      | Usually it's really just noticing that I'm doing the same thing over and over again,                     |
| 08:19      | or if something feels tedious, or I'm, you know, falling behind on certain sort of tasks,                |
| 08:25      | and then I'll typically just put it into a note, I currently keep them in the bear note                  |
| 08:30      | taking app.                                                                                              |
| 08:31      | I've got an automation ideas note in there.                                                              |
| 08:34      | And some of those might never get implemented.                                                           |
| 08:36      | Some might get implemented tomorrow.                                                                     |
| 08:38      | But as I continue to have ideas around them, then I'll, I'll just add some notes.                        |
| 08:42      | And if it's something more complex, I might use a tool like my node or OmniGraffle to really              |
| 08:48      | map out all of the different scenarios and kind of more of a graphical way.                              |
| 08:53      | And then look at, you know, how to structure it and maybe how to, to break it out.                       |
| 08:59      | Maybe this one automation is involving multiple shortcuts or something like that.                        |
| 09:03      | And I want to kind of component, componentise things and, and so this, a lot of them I think             |
| 09:09      | are as simple enough to just express as a note, but the more advanced ones get kind                      |
| 09:12      | of more of a graphical design treatment.                                                                 |
| 09:16      | That's a very smart way of doing it.                                                                     |
| 09:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:19      | It's like, I know you well enough, Tim, you're like me.                                                  |
| 09:22      | It's like some folks, you know, for fun, watch baseball, you know, for me, I have a list                 |
| 09:27      | of little automations I want to build.                                                                   |
| 09:29      | So, you know, that equation as to the time it takes to build it versus the return on                     |
| 09:34      | investment.                                                                                              |
| 09:36      | Sometimes it doesn't really equate out, but for me, it's almost like a hobby thing.                      |
| 09:40      | So I've always got a list of things I want to automate at some point.                                    |
| 09:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:45      | One point to make there.                                                                                 |
| 09:46      | I think automation is really just about saving time.                                                     |
| 09:48      | It's about producing consistent results.                                                                 |
| 09:52      | So there might be something I could do very easily in a very short amount of time, but                   |
| 09:56      | maybe it's something I don't even want to be thinking about.                                             |
| 09:59      | And maybe it's that one sort of condition that shows up every few months and I want                      |
| 10:05      | to have it taken care of or, or just have a very clean notification to let me know what's                |
| 10:09      | going on.                                                                                                |
| 10:10      | And if it were just about saving time, it probably wouldn't be worth the time I put                      |
| 10:16      | into developing it, but that's sort of the pressure that it takes off and the added trust                |
| 10:21      | that it gives me in my system that makes it totally worthwhile.                                          |
| 10:25      | And I think it's time well spent too, just having some fun with these things and used                    |
| 10:30      | to play with Lego and Meccano as a kids.                                                                 |
| 10:32      | And so this is, I think, in a way, the modern equivalent for me.                                         |
| 10:36      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 10:37      | Shortcuts is a hobby.                                                                                    |
| 10:38      | You can play anywhere with you on your iPhone.                                                           |
| 10:40      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 10:41      | I mean, let's be honest, the three of us, I know, like I treat it like as a game, you                    |
| 10:48      | know, laying in bed, I will be playing with shortcut tools, you know, or my wife would                   |
| 10:52      | be sitting next to me playing a game.                                                                    |
| 10:54      | So it's just, it's just fun to make your devices do things.                                              |
| 11:00      | And the whole reason we make this show is that anybody can do it with automation tools.                  |
| 11:04      | You don't need to learn X code, you don't need to have this heavy load to carry.                         |
| 11:09      | And it's really quite fun.                                                                               |
| 11:11      | So why don't we talk about that, Tim?                                                                    |
| 11:13      | Share some automation with us.                                                                           |
| 11:15      | I thought it'd be fun to start with, like, what's a small automation that you use often                  |
| 11:19      | that helps you out?                                                                                      |
| 11:22      | One that I use all the time is just simply driving to the next event.                                    |
| 11:28      | That's very useful.                                                                                      |
| 11:29      | And I'll have some little prompts in there, like, do I want to start my overcast podcast                 |
| 11:33      | playing back?                                                                                            |
| 11:35      | And if my wife's in the car, I usually don't start that up.                                              |
| 11:37      | She's not always interested in the same podcast, but yeah, just something as simple as that              |
| 11:43      | to where I just sit in the car.                                                                          |
| 11:44      | I've actually got it triggered now by an iBeacon.                                                        |
| 11:48      | So I just get in the car and press a button and it's off to the races.                                   |
| 11:54      | And in some cases, it might send a message to say I'm on my way.                                         |
| 11:58      | Here's my estimated time of arrival, things like that.                                                   |
| 12:01      | But it's just one of those things, especially if I am running a little late or something                 |
| 12:05      | like that.                                                                                               |
| 12:06      | And it does take the pressure off.                                                                       |
| 12:08      | I don't have to go, like, digging for an address or something like that.                                 |
| 12:12      | It's listening to my favourite podcast on the journey, and it just removes a little bit                   |
| 12:18      | of that friction there.                                                                                  |
| 12:19      | Let's break that one down a little bit.                                                                  |
| 12:21      | We just covered iBeacon in our last episode.                                                             |
| 12:23      | I don't think, Rose, we mentioned, but that's a good idea to put an iBeacon in your car                  |
| 12:27      | because you can turn down the transmission power enough that it's a very small bubble                    |
| 12:33      | of trigger.                                                                                              |
| 12:35      | And so Tim's using the iBeacon as trigger.                                                               |
| 12:37      | I guess you're using Pushcut to start a shortcut.                                                      |
| 12:40      | Is that how you're doing it?                                                                             |
| 12:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 12:42      | Until recently, I was using Launch Center Pro, but I've started to move those things                     |
| 12:45      | over to Pushcut just to get a little bit more flexibility in some of those cases.                      |
| 12:51      | And that's a case where I don't really need to launch it manually.                                       |
| 12:54      | This really intended to be launched automatically.                                                       |
| 12:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 12:58      | So what does a shortcut do?                                                                              |
| 13:00      | It gives you a question about it, because you talked about sending text messages and                     |
| 13:04      | playing podcasts.                                                                                        |
| 13:05      | It sounds to me like you've got several elements to that shortcut.                                       |
| 13:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 13:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 13:10      | So first of all, it'll ask if I want to continue my podcast playback, and that'll trigger                |
| 13:15      | the latest podcast on Overcast to resume.                                                                |
| 13:18      | And then it'll pull a list of upcoming events.                                                           |
| 13:21      | And I think I have it just set for that day, and give me a menu, and I'll select that item,              |
| 13:26      | and then I'm on my way.                                                                                  |
| 13:29      | If I'm heading home specifically, so if I'm not at home, and this is a little enhancement                |
| 13:34      | I still need to put in where it's going to detect you're not at home, then I would typically             |
| 13:38      | send a message to my wife saying I'm on my way.                                                          |
| 13:42      | Here's my estimated time of arrival.                                                                     |
| 13:45      | And so that sends automatically in the background too.                                                   |
| 13:48      | So it's part of that one button click, and yeah, just one of those things, I could easily                |
| 13:54      | do it manually, but the sort of the friction that it relieves from having that all happen                |
| 14:01      | automatically is what really makes it attractive.                                                        |
| 14:04      | And I think that having the eye beacon is the icing on the cake, because it's only                       |
| 14:10      | going to show up when it's appropriate to show up, and I don't really even need any                      |
| 14:14      | other way to trigger it.                                                                                 |
| 14:15      | It's just pretty automatic at that point.                                                                |
| 14:18      | Yeah, I'm thinking that different ways you could trigger that.                                           |
| 14:20      | You could trigger it with an NFC sticker, like if you put a sticker in your car, if                      |
| 14:24      | you didn't want to do eye beacon, where you could tap the phone on the sticker.                          |
| 14:28      | You could also, if you had Carplay, most Carplay cars require you to plug in, so the plug-in             |
| 14:34      | of the Carplay could trigger it.                                                                         |
| 14:37      | So there's a lot of ways you could do it, but I think the eye beacon is a very elegant                   |
| 14:40      | way of doing that, because it doesn't require any really action by you.                                  |
| 14:45      | One thing you just said that I have not experimented with, you said, well, if I am getting in the        |
| 14:51      | car and I'm not home, I want to send my wife a text message, so the automation there would               |
| 14:57      | be get the current location and compare it to your home address.                                         |
| 15:02      | If it's not my home address, then do this thing, in this case, send a text message.                      |
| 15:06      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                           |
| 15:08      | So I just, honestly, I hadn't thought about doing it in that way.                                        |
| 15:12      | Does shortcuts do that natively, where you can look for a negative, say, if I'm not at                   |
| 15:16      | this location?                                                                                           |
| 15:18      | I don't know if that would be possible to be done natively.                                              |
| 15:22      | I think that's where something like push cut would come into play.                                       |
| 15:25      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 15:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 15:27      | I'd need to experiment with that a little bit more, just to...                                           |
| 15:29      | Yeah, you haven't built that one yet.                                                                    |
| 15:31      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                           |
| 15:32      | Some of these are a little aspirational, like I'm trying to figure out a way of actually                 |
| 15:36      | telling is my wife in the car.                                                                           |
| 15:39      | I don't think the find my shortcut functionality actually exposes that yet, but I think as               |
| 15:47      | much as possible, I like these things to happen automatically and kind of tune into the surrounding.     |
| 15:53      | Who's there?                                                                                             |
| 15:54      | Where am I?                                                                                              |
| 15:55      | Even what's the weather?                                                                                 |
| 15:56      | Like right now, and then have the automations adapt according to those circumstances?                    |
| 16:02      | It'd be cool if you could pull like airdrop, because airdrop knows if your wife is near.                 |
| 16:08      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                |
| 16:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 16:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 16:11      | But I don't think that's really possible yet with shortcuts.                                             |
| 16:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 16:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 16:14      | So that's a case where it's maybe 80% of the way that I want it to maybe in iOS 14, it'll                |
| 16:19      | have those extra features that take me all the way.                                                      |
| 16:24      | Rose, have you ever looked for a negative on a map search like Tim's describing?                         |
| 16:29      | So I am literally playing with it right now, and this is a really annoying thing.                        |
| 16:34      | So what you have to do is you have to compare something like the street or the zip code,                 |
| 16:39      | which depending on where you live.                                                                       |
| 16:40      | So for example, when I'm at home, my building is officially on one street, but my flat is                |
| 16:46      | on the corner of the building.                                                                           |
| 16:47      | So whenever I look at my address with location, it actually says I'm a different street address.         |
| 16:52      | So I think the best bet for that is to get your current location and to say like, if                     |
| 16:57      | the latitude is less than this or more than that, and if the longitude is less than this                 |
| 17:05      | and more than that, then do this, which is going to require like four nested if statements.              |
| 17:12      | But it's doable.                                                                                         |
| 17:13      | It would be really nice to be able to compare locations.                                                 |
| 17:16      | Eeronically, if you put the location in the second field for comparison, then you can                     |
| 17:20      | actually have it a whole street address, but I'm struggling to actually compare street                   |
| 17:25      | addresses here.                                                                                          |
| 17:26      | Yeah, I would think like for a lot of people, though, you're not going to have the problem               |
| 17:29      | Rose has where it's returning to street addresses.                                                       |
| 17:31      | Well, it depends on where you live.                                                                      |
| 17:33      | Yeah, but if you don't have that problem, you could just say if the street name matches,                 |
| 17:41      | then you're a positive that you're at home.                                                              |
| 17:45      | So if the street name doesn't match, then you run the automation.                                        |
| 17:50      | Does that make sense?                                                                                    |
| 17:52      | Or maybe even the distance from home, if it's less than 200 meters or something like that,               |
| 17:57      | then I'm probably not driving anyway.                                                                    |
| 17:59      | So I'm going to assume that I'm at home if I'm within that sort of geofence of them.                     |
| 18:04      | Yeah, interesting.                                                                                       |
| 18:05      | I'll put a link to the dummy that I've just set up in the show notes.                                    |
| 18:09      | It's comparing Apple Park with your current location.                                                    |
| 18:11      | So if you're at Apple Park, this is not going to work while you're running it, but I'm                   |
| 18:15      | sure you can figure out how to modify it.                                                                |
| 18:17      | Yeah, that's cool.                                                                                       |
| 18:18      | The one problem I was thinking with iBeacon in the car is like I do a lot of yard work                   |
| 18:24      | and I could just see the thing triggering when I'm pulling weeds because I'm close enough                |
| 18:27      | to the car.                                                                                              |
| 18:28      | I think turning that power down on it and I keep it in the glove box and the fact it's                   |
| 18:35      | enclosed in metal cars is probably going to limit its range a little bit intrinsically.                  |
| 18:40      | So I think it's just a matter of playing with the signal strength on the iBeacon to fine                 |
| 18:45      | tune it so that until you're within a few feet of the currents, it's not going to detect                 |
| 18:51      | it.                                                                                                      |
| 18:52      | Yeah, I think that's a very common fodder for automation, though, getting in the car.                    |
| 18:56      | I mean, a lot of people have built shortcuts around wake up in the morning, kind of the                  |
| 19:01      | morning routine shortcut.                                                                                |
| 19:03      | I put one in the shortcuts field guide.                                                                  |
| 19:04      | I think, Rose, did you put one of those in your book as well?                                            |
| 19:07      | Yes, yes, I did.                                                                                         |
| 19:09      | Yeah, that's like everybody.                                                                             |
| 19:10      | But I think the car one is also a really good one for folks if you want to get a started                 |
| 19:15      | automation, you know, trying to, you know, what do I do when I get in the car?                           |
| 19:19      | Because a lot of people have a few different things, maybe there's a different show or                   |
| 19:22      | different playlist you want.                                                                             |
| 19:24      | So that's something worth trying.                                                                        |
| 19:25      | I've been playing a bit with the opposite scenario where I'm actually leaving the iBeacon.               |
| 19:32      | And it's not as quite as good as it could be.                                                            |
| 19:34      | I think there's about a 30 second delay before it actually notifies, but it's still useful.              |
| 19:39      | So one use case there is I work at a co-working space in downtown Vancouver a couple of days             |
| 19:45      | a week.                                                                                                  |
| 19:46      | And when I leave my desk, then I want to make sure my Mac gets locked so it'll trigger a                 |
| 19:52      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] script once I leave that if I've been gone for more than 30 seconds                     |
| 19:58      | and actually lock the computer there.                                                                    |
| 20:01      | So I've found that's very useful as well and that's something I've been doing with push                  |
| 20:04      | cut as well.                                                                                             |
| 20:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 20:06      | So that's an iBeacon at the desk?                                                                        |
| 20:08      | iBeacon at the desk.                                                                                     |
| 20:09      | Yeah, it's just sitting in the desk drawer and I've got the signal strength set very                     |
| 20:14      | low on that.                                                                                             |
| 20:15      | So once I walk, you know, maybe about 10 feet away from the desk, then it's already at least             |
| 20:23      | triggering that.                                                                                         |
| 20:24      | And if I do happen to just walk away for 10 seconds or something, come back in, nothing's                |
| 20:29      | going to happen.                                                                                         |
| 20:30      | But if I'm gone for about 30 seconds, that's where it'll trigger the computer to lock.                   |
| 20:35      | That's a really useful shortcut because I have the same thing at work where I could wander               |
| 20:39      | away from my desk.                                                                                       |
| 20:40      | And if I'm just running to the printer, I don't really need to lock my computer.                         |
| 20:43      | But the rest of the time, you know, I leave my desk, if I'm going to the kitchen to get                  |
| 20:46      | a glass of water, there's a fairly good chance I'm going to get sidetracked by a colleague.              |
| 20:50      | So I should actually add that.                                                                           |
| 20:52      | So I have an iBeacon on my desk already for helping me track my time.                                    |
| 20:55      | I should also have a push cut give me a menu of options there so that I can lock my computer             |
| 20:59      | or track my time or both.                                                                                |
| 21:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 21:03      | Yeah, that sounds perfect, Tim.                                                                          |

| 21:18      | When's the last time you took a good look at all the cruft on your Mac?                                  |
| 21:22      | I'm guessing it's been a while because that's a bunch of work.                                           |
| 21:25      | Why don't you make that job easy with CleanMyMac X?                                                      |
| 21:29      | It has a bunch of useful features like system junk removal module and space lens, which                  |
| 21:34      | lets you see a size comparison of all your folders to detect those that take too much                    |
| 21:39      | space.                                                                                                   |
| 21:40      | CleanMyMac X is one of the best investments you can make to get your old Mac working as                  |
| 21:44      | good as new.                                                                                             |
| 21:46      | And it's different from your average Mac optimisation tool.                                              |
| 21:49      | It has real time malware monitor, which works in the background, scanning your Mac for potential         |
| 21:54      | threats and notifying you if anything is detected.                                                       |
| 21:57      | And it's not just great for security stuff either.                                                       |
| 22:00      | It's great help when it comes to uninstalling apps from your Mac because it removes both                 |
| 22:04      | the app and the leftover data to help you avoid digital clutter.                                         |

| 22:51      | All right, Tim, you have a website called Learn OmniFocus.                                               |
| 22:58      | I want to hear some of your OmniFocus automation.                                                        |
| 23:00      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                              |
| 23:03      | Most of my OmniFocus automations are on keyboard and maestro, and I tend to be more Mac-based.           |
| 23:11      | I certainly make good use of the iPhone and iPad, but a lot of them happen on the Mac.                   |
| 23:17      | And some of them are just very simple.                                                                   |
| 23:20      | I'm not sure I'd even call them automations.                                                             |
| 23:21      | I just want to be able to quickly jump to a perspective or quickly activate, quick open                  |
| 23:26      | or something like that, wherever I happen to be.                                                         |
| 23:29      | The main ones that I use within [[OmniFocus]] itself are [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] that either other                     |
| 23:35      | people have written and I'm using as is, or other people have written and I'm using them                 |
| 23:39      | with a few modifications, so things like populate template placeholders that Kurt Clifton wrote.         |
| 23:47      | I use that to generate a lot of the projects, especially the typical things I do, like new               |
| 23:52      | content development, ones to tally up the estimated hours, things like that.                             |
| 23:59      | And on the iOS side of things, the shortcuts I have over there are more about accessing                  |
| 24:05      | things quickly, a specific perspective or a tag or something like that, and essentially                  |
| 24:10      | bringing a quick open type functionality on the iPads, because I tend to be more accessing               |
| 24:18      | projects and actions there than I am creating them or doing the types of things I would                  |
| 24:26      | do on the Mac.                                                                                           |
| 24:27      | But just having that really quick access to what I need and getting to where I need to                   |
| 24:32      | be, I find that to be very useful.                                                                       |
| 24:35      | And in some cases, I'll also bring up a, like the one I mentioned about the iBeacon that                 |
| 24:41      | my co-working space, I'll have it actually bring up the hot list when I get back to my                   |
| 24:46      | desk, because it's, I think, easy to get sidetracked, so I want to see what are my most important        |
| 24:51      | actions in OmniFocus and really keep that on my radar as I go through the day.                           |
| 24:56      | Yeah, hot list is your perspective showing your most important tasks.                                    |
| 25:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 25:01      | Everything that's either flagged or is going to be due soon goes on that list.                           |
| 25:06      | It's usually a fairly small list, maybe 10 to 15 things at the most, but the productive                  |
| 25:13      | day is really completing everything on that hot list, and anything beyond that is this                   |
| 25:18      | kind of bonus.                                                                                           |
| 25:20      | It's interesting to me that you're using the Curt Clifton scripts.                                       |
| 25:23      | I have been, I kind of gave up on those, and I've been using the shortcut automation, because            |
| 25:30      | the shortcut stuff is really powerful in OmniFocus, I'm just surprised you don't do that for your        |
| 25:35      | template builds.                                                                                         |
| 25:36      | I think the main reason I haven't gotten into that habit is I tend to experiment with different          |
| 25:42      | namings and things like that, and so if I change the name of a tag, that means going                     |
| 25:46      | back and changing all the scripts and so forth, though Rose did write a very clever                      |
| 25:52      | shortcut that allows me to use the templates in the form they were designed for Curt Clifton's           |
| 25:58      | script, and I can actually run those as a shortcut as well.                                              |
| 26:01      | So if I want to create a new project on my iPad, for instance, I can still tap into that                 |
| 26:06      | same functionality.                                                                                      |
| 26:07      | And it's something, yeah, I'm going to kind of explore over time, especially now, that                   |
| 26:14      | with OmniFocus 3.4, they've got a lot more options in terms of using shortcuts within                    |
| 26:21      | OmniFocus with the parameter-based shortcuts and so forth, so that's definitely got the                  |
| 26:28      | wheels turning.                                                                                          |
| 26:29      | I'll tell you, every time I corner the shortcuts team at Apple, I complain about the notes               |
| 26:35      | field, the text field, because basically because of OmniFocus templates, because they're long            |
| 26:41      | text for me.                                                                                             |
| 26:42      | I mean, I've got kind of complex templates, I use them when I make new companies and do                  |
| 26:47      | legal work, but the working in that tiny text field is just madness.                                     |
| 26:53      | And that is one reason why I can understand why you want to keep doing it on the Mac.                    |
| 26:58      | And I think the one way around that is to keep those, where possible, to keep at least                   |
| 27:02      | some of that code in [[Drafts]] and just reference it from there.                                            |
| 27:05      | And especially now with [[Drafts]] on the Mac, I think that's what might kind of pull me                     |
| 27:09      | over to doing more of that sort of thing, just the convenience of, okay, I did change                    |
| 27:14      | the name of one of my tags, but I can go into [[Drafts]] on the Mac and make that change and                 |
| 27:19      | it automatically gets picked up by the shortcuts.                                                        |
| 27:22      | So it's, the draft essentially becomes like a library that shortcuts uses, and I think                   |
| 27:26      | that greatly reduces the amount of code that needs to go into the shortcuts themselves                   |
| 27:31      | and then can be reused and opens up a lot of options there.                                              |
| 27:36      | But there's still a problem.                                                                             |
| 27:37      | There's still a problem.                                                                                 |
| 27:38      | You have to put the tokens in for the variables, and that's like, I don't know if you guys,              |
| 27:45      | when kids, I don't know if they had this game in the UK, Rose, but we had a game in the                  |
| 27:49      | US called Operation.                                                                                     |
| 27:50      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 27:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 27:52      | It's like playing a game of operation, putting those tokens in the text field and shortcuts.             |
| 27:55      | I'm like, you're crazy.                                                                                  |
| 27:57      | I actually have a slightly different solution to the problem of templates because I don't                |
| 28:01      | like keeping them in OmniFocus because every software when I'm searching, you know, I have               |
| 28:04      | to search for everything because I'm looking for something that was also completed or dropped            |
| 28:08      | or maybe on hold, and then my templates pop up and it's annoying.                                        |
| 28:12      | So I've put all of it in [[Drafts]], but I actually have a whole action group in [[Drafts]] where                |
| 28:17      | it populates the template placeholders.                                                                  |
| 28:19      | It's basically, you copy out what is currently in the OmniFocus with the French quotation                |
| 28:24      | marks, for example, if you're using the original Kirk Clifton style of templates, and then               |
| 28:28      | it finds those and replaces them for you.                                                                |
| 28:31      | And that works really well for me because then all of my templates are in [[Drafts]] and                     |
| 28:34      | they work on all the platforms.                                                                          |
| 28:36      | Yeah, and then you don't need the tokens because you're doing it in [[Drafts]].                              |
| 28:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 28:41      | Makes sense.                                                                                             |
| 28:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 28:43      | I should do that.                                                                                        |
| 28:44      | That would take time for me to go back and redo everything.                                              |
| 28:47      | So I'm torn between the time it would take to do it right in [[Drafts]] or just hobble along                 |
| 28:53      | with the shortcuts text field.                                                                           |
| 28:55      | You could always hire that one out to an assistant, David.                                               |
| 28:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 28:59      | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| 29:00      | When it comes to automation stuff, I want to make sure it's got to be right.                             |
| 29:02      | Like Tim was saying earlier, this is a place to get accuracy as well.                                    |
| 29:06      | So that's hard for me.                                                                                   |
| 29:09      | You had mentioned, you also had a real simple OmniFocus action when you have a client, meaning           |
| 29:15      | that I thought was kind of interesting.                                                                  |
| 29:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 29:18      | So while this is not specific to OmniFocus, but I do a lot of, I use Zoom extensively.                   |
| 29:25      | I practically live on Zoom some days and work with people all over the world.                            |
| 29:30      | Sometimes I'm doing one-on-one work or I might be doing training for a group or leading                  |
| 29:35      | a learning OmniFocus session or something like that.                                                     |
| 29:38      | And so I have a shortcut I call Prepare to Zoom.                                                         |
| 29:43      | And so I trigger that usually by voice.                                                                  |
| 29:46      | And that does some things in my environment.                                                             |
| 29:48      | It puts the Apple TV to sleep.                                                                           |
| 29:50      | So if there's music playing that stops the music, it uses HomeKit to adjust the lighting                 |
| 29:55      | in my office here.                                                                                       |
| 29:58      | And then it triggers a [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcut.                                                        |
| 30:02      | And the specific one it triggers depends on what the upcoming meeting is.                                |
| 30:06      | So it's actually looking at the calendar.                                                                |
| 30:09      | If I'm doing something for Learn OmniFocus, I actually use a different user account on                   |
| 30:12      | my Mac.                                                                                                  |
| 30:14      | So it's a different [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro entirely.                                                     |
| 30:20      | But either way, it'll go through a whole sequence of things that involves, if it's a client              |
| 30:25      | meeting, it's going to create a new note and bear with the date of the meeting.                          |
| 30:29      | And it's going to adjust the camera settings.                                                            |
| 30:32      | So I've got the right Zoom level and everything.                                                         |
| 30:36      | It's going to turn on the Do Not Disturb if it's not on already.                                         |
| 30:39      | So it goes through a whole sequence.                                                                     |
| 30:41      | And the nice thing is if I think of some more things that I'd like to happen, I can just                 |
| 30:45      | go into [[Keyboard Maestro]] and add that to the list.                                                       |
| 30:49      | And this kind of came out of the way I've done this in the past is to have a checklist                   |
| 30:53      | and OmniFocus that I go through and I'm, for instance, preparing to do a call like this.                 |
| 30:58      | And it was kind of getting tedious and there's quite a long list of things just to make sure             |
| 31:03      | all the devices are silenced and so forth.                                                               |
| 31:06      | So as much as possible, I've been taking all those checklist items and just having them                  |
| 31:11      | happen automatically.                                                                                    |
| 31:12      | And there's a few that by nature need to be done manually, but I'm finding more and more                 |
| 31:18      | I can just speak those words and everything just magically happens and I just sit back                   |
| 31:25      | and enjoy the show.                                                                                      |
| 31:26      | Yeah, I do something very similar before I podcast and it was the exact same problem                     |
| 31:30      | I had, a checklist, I'm like, why am I manually doing all this stuff when [[Keyboard Maestro]]               |
| 31:36      | could do it for me?                                                                                      |
| 31:38      | And it's actually better more accurately put the windows exactly where you want them and                 |
| 31:43      | make sure you never forget anything.                                                                     |
| 31:45      | So I think this is something a lot of people could use.                                                  |
| 31:49      | One of the things you said, though, I'd like to unpack a little bit is you said you trigger              |
| 31:52      | it by voice and that's on your Mac, right?                                                               |
| 31:55      | Yep, that's on the, well, I trigger it actually on the iPhone typically or the iPad.                     |
| 32:00      | So how does it go from triggering it on your iPhone to [[Keyboard Maestro]] performing actions?              |
| 32:07      | So that's where it's, I've got it set up to trigger based on a URL in [[Keyboard Maestro]].                  |
| 32:13      | And so this is essentially a public URL, but it's long and complicated.                                  |
| 32:17      | So unless someone happened to find it in some document or something somewhere, it's not                  |
| 32:23      | likely to be triggered by anyone except for me and anyone I happen to share with.                        |
| 32:29      | So it's really just a matter of, within the shortcut, there's just a URL command and it                  |
| 32:36      | causes [[Keyboard Maestro]] to wake up and do its things.                                                    |
| 32:40      | And that's what's, that was really an aha moment when I realised that was possible because               |
| 32:45      | there's certain things that can be done in shortcuts, but can be done in [[Keyboard Maestro]]                |
| 32:50      | and there's things that can't be done in [[Keyboard Maestro]], but can be done in shortcuts.                 |
| 32:56      | So this way I can easily, easily create something that uses the best of both technologies.               |
| 33:02      | And if I wanted to get really fancy, I could even have his app here, his app that triggers               |
| 33:06      | a [[Keyboard Maestro]] or through PushCutts, it could even trigger something to happen on                     |
| 33:11      | the iOS device.                                                                                          |
| 33:12      | So it's kind of connecting all of these technologies that on the surface seem rather separate,           |
| 33:19      | but with a little bit of wizardry that once you've done it's actually not that difficult                 |
| 33:25      | to do in the future.                                                                                     |
| 33:27      | It suddenly gives this whole integrated system that's, yeah, just where I can kind of choose             |
| 33:33      | the best pieces of all of these different technologies.                                                  |
| 33:36      | Yeah, the interesting point about that is this URL triggers are recognised by all three                  |
| 33:42      | of these automation platforms, online shortcuts and [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                    |
| 33:48      | So it gives you a universal trigger that can go across them.                                             |
| 33:53      | And if you're struggling right now with something to do that, you should look into these URL             |
| 33:58      | triggers, because that's a great solution.                                                               |
| 34:02      | I've been using URL triggers quite a bit recently, especially combined with the URL triggers             |
| 34:07      | for [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                    |
| 34:08      | You can specify if it should trigger on all computers or just one computer.                              |
| 34:12      | And there are some things that I want to use on all of my computers if they're online,                   |
| 34:17      | including the ones that work, versus I'm quite happy for it to just run on the one at home               |
| 34:23      | and hopefully the one at home is still running.                                                          |
| 34:27      | It's a very useful feature and I've been very much enjoying my experiments with it, especially           |
| 34:32      | I at one point had something, I've got rid of it now, but I had shortcuts triggering Keyboard            |
| 34:38      | Maestro and when [[Keyboard Maestro]] was finished, it was then triggering PushCut so that I would           |
| 34:42      | know that it had finished.                                                                               |
| 34:43      | So I was having one device talk to another, which was then talking back, which was great                 |
| 34:49      | fun.                                                                                                     |
| 34:50      | Oh, so PushCut was basically just letting you know that the automation had run successfully?             |
| 34:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 34:56      | And so that then I could pick up and do the next part that I wanted to do because I have                 |
| 34:59      | manual steps involved.                                                                                   |
| 35:00      | And I've managed to now automate the entire thing, which I'm very happy about, but I kind                |
| 35:04      | of miss the fun of shortcuts, triggers, keyboard, maestro, triggers, PushCut, because it sounds          |
| 35:09      | like a Rube-Goldberg machine and it kind of is, but it was great fun.                                    |
| 35:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 35:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 35:15      | Oh, no, I think the sky's the limit once we have all these connections through the URL                   |
| 35:19      | shortcuts.                                                                                               |
| 35:20      | I have to admit, though, for me, the setup shortcuts like all the [[Keyboard Maestro]] stuff                 |
| 35:24      | to prepare for podcasting or doing one of these things, I really, since I've got a                       |
| 35:30      | Stream Deck in my life, I've just got a row of buttons dedicated to those.                               |
| 35:33      | And there's something very satisfying about sitting down and pressing a button on the                    |
| 35:37      | Stream Deck and having your computer just reconfigure itself for you like a transformer.                 |
| 35:42      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                |
| 35:43      | I've got a Stream Deck as well to the XL one, the bigger one.                                            |
| 35:47      | And I find that especially useful when I'm on, especially when I'm like hosting and                      |
| 35:52      | learn OmniFocus session or something like that, where there's a lot going on and presenting              |
| 35:56      | on a topic that messages are flying into the chat box.                                                   |
| 36:00      | And the last thing I want to think about is what's the keyboard shortcut to turn on screen               |
| 36:05      | sharing or something like that.                                                                          |
| 36:07      | So that's where I have this nice row of keys.                                                            |
| 36:09      | And if I decide I want to share the screen, I just press a button and either it just                     |
| 36:15      | triggers a keyboard shortcut or it triggers a keyboard Maestro automation that walks                     |
| 36:20      | through the steps to make that happen.                                                                   |
| 36:22      | And yeah, just really, really takes the pressure off.                                                    |
| 36:25      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 36:26      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 36:27      | I've been experimenting.                                                                                 |
| 36:28      | I only got the 16 button Stream Deck, but I think I'm going to end up with 32 as well.                   |
| 36:31      | And then the 16 can be, you know, it can travel everywhere with my laptop basically.                     |
| 36:37      | It's worth noting too that keyboard Maestro now supports the Stream Deck and the icons                   |
| 36:43      | can even be changed as a result of what's happening in the keyboard Maestro macro.                       |
| 36:49      | So if things are changing and they can reveal a status of this is in progress or on hold                 |
| 36:54      | or it's done or something like that, and so in addition to having buttons to press the                   |
| 36:59      | do things, I find it's really nice to have a status panel so I can monitor what is actually              |
| 37:05      | going on and is I could, so I, for instance, I could look at the menu and zoom and say                   |
| 37:12      | is the menu item saying mute item, in which case I know that the microphone is live.                     |
| 37:19      | And then I could have it so I press the button and it actually changes the state of it.                  |
| 37:23      | So it's giving the feature as well as the status.                                                        |
| 37:27      | It's just really nice.                                                                                   |
| 37:28      | I mean, somebody was asking me recently, do I really need one of these things?                           |
| 37:32      | I'm not sure I would tell anybody they really need one of them.                                          |
| 37:35      | You could do all this stuff with keyboard shortcuts.                                                     |
| 37:38      | And if you're into automation, I mean, we, I talked in the keyboard Maestro field guide                  |
| 37:43      | about the hyper key, but that stuff is out there where, you know, there's a lot of ways                  |
| 37:46      | you can trigger shortcuts and palettes and keyboard Maestro are awesome, which gives                     |
| 37:50      | you even more flexibility.                                                                               |
| 37:52      | So you could do all this stuff without a Stream Deck, but as someone who doesn't like to have            |
| 37:58      | a lot of extra stuff on my desk, the Stream Deck has absolutely earned its place for me.                 |
| 38:04      | Right now I have a Christmas music button.                                                               |
| 38:05      | I want Christmas music.                                                                                  |
| 38:06      | I just push a button.                                                                                    |
| 38:07      | That'll go away in a couple of weeks, but it's pretty cool.                                              |
| 38:10      | Actually, that'll probably be gone by the time the show publishes, but it's kind of fun                  |
| 38:14      | that you can set those little buttons up like that.                                                      |
| 38:17      | I think they can also serve as a visual reminder.                                                        |
| 38:19      | So if you're kind of have a different panel of buttons, that's a reminder of what you're,                |
| 38:24      | what sort of work mode you're in, or maybe you're not even working and they're more geared               |
| 38:28      | towards, you know, watching some media or entertainment or something like that.                          |
| 38:32      | So it can be, that's something you don't get from a keyboard.                                            |
| 38:35      | The keyboard looks the same every time you look at it, but the Stream Deck and can really                |
| 38:39      | shift.                                                                                                   |
| 38:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 38:41      | Just kind of cue the things that you maybe want to be doing right now, provide as little                 |
| 38:47      | friction as possible to actually do them by giving that one button click to them.                        |
| 38:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 38:53      | I have no regrets over this purchase.                                                                    |
| 38:56      | Maybe one day, Rose, we'll just have to do a show on all the stuff we're doing with                      |
| 39:00      | these Stream Decks.                                                                                      |
| 39:01      | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| 39:02      | Well, I think it would be interesting to see both what we're doing with Stream Decks                     |
| 39:05      | and what we're not doing with Stream Decks because we've solved them in other ways.                      |
| 39:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:10      | I've even heard of people having multiple Stream Decks where you can have one that kind                  |
| 39:13      | of sets the mode for the other one too.                                                                  |
| 39:16      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 39:17      | Oh my goodness.                                                                                          |
| 39:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:19      | There's somebody in the forums, I believe Martin Packer has two of them, and he originally               |
| 39:22      | thought that he was going to be fine with the 16 and then he got the 32 and now he's                     |
| 39:25      | using both.                                                                                              |
| 39:26      | Which in some cases, like if you're in a recording studio or something, I can totally see the            |
| 39:31      | need for having all those buttons too.                                                                   |
| 39:34      | So I think there's definitely some good use cases there.                                                 |
| 39:38      | I saw that thread and I just skipped it.                                                                 |
| 39:40      | I did not read it intentionally.                                                                         |
| 39:43      | I feel like that's Kryptonite for me.                                                                    |
| 39:45      | I don't want to get near it.                                                                             |
| 39:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:48      | Sparky needs more Stream Decks.                                                                          |
| 39:49      | That's the secret.                                                                                       |
| 39:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:51      | That's the secret.                                                                                       |
| 39:52      | You need one for each monitor, I think at least.                                                         |
| 39:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 39:55      | At least.                                                                                                |
| 39:56      | At least.                                                                                                |
| 39:57      | I want to wear one on my arm, you know, just let's go all the way.                                       |
| 39:59      | Make it Bluetooth.                                                                                       |
| 40:00      | I can just strap it to my arm.                                                                           |
| 40:01      | They do have an app as well that runs on the iPhone.                                                     |
| 40:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 40:05      | I haven't actually used it, but yeah, that's a subscription option, but it's great to try                |
| 40:10      | out if you're looking at the Stream Deck going, I don't know if I want it because the stream             |
| 40:13      | deck hardware itself can be kind of pricey, but if you get it on sale on Amazon, it's                    |
| 40:18      | worth it for sure.                                                                                       |
| 40:21      | And even if you don't, if you've got the right automations, it's great, but if you                       |
| 40:24      | want to try it, then you can try the Stream Deck app on like an iPhone or an iPad and                    |
| 40:28      | subscribe for a month to see if it's worth it for you.                                                   |

| 40:45      | too slow.                                                                                                |

| 41:53      | So Tim, you've already mentioned that you've got some things going on with Zapier, but                   |
| 41:57      | I'm sure you've got more than just one or two automations.                                               |
| 41:59      | Could you tell us some more about what you're doing with that?                                           |
| 42:02      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                              |
| 42:03      | A lot of them revolve around their nominee focus, and that's a WordPress site.                           |
| 42:07      | And a couple of the plug-in components of the site do have support for Zapier, in particular             |
| 42:15      | WooCommerce, which is what I use for all of the e-commerce transactions and subscriptions                |
| 42:21      | and so forth, as well as there's an excellent WordPress plug-in called GravityForms.                     |
| 42:28      | So I can essentially create zaps that treat these WooCommerce and GravityForms as just                   |
| 42:35      | like other services.                                                                                     |
| 42:36      | And so I could say if a one that I built quite recently is if there's a payment that fails,              |
| 42:43      | it creates a task in Asana to follow up with it.                                                         |
| 42:48      | And the reason I put it in Asana is I'm starting to kind of move some things out of OmniFocus            |
| 42:54      | in order to have an assistant who's going to be dealing with that stuff so I can start                   |
| 42:58      | to take some load off my shoulders.                                                                      |
| 43:02      | But it just automatically happens in the background.                                                     |
| 43:05      | So instead of getting an email to say this payment is failed, it's just adding it to                     |
| 43:08      | the list in Asana.                                                                                       |
| 43:10      | It's even pulling in the information about when was the last subscription payment.                       |
| 43:16      | It automatically builds a link that I can click on that takes me back into the WordPress                 |
| 43:22      | site back to that specific record in WooCommerce so I can get a better idea of what's going              |
| 43:28      | on.                                                                                                      |
| 43:29      | And one nice thing about that is it really just takes email out of the equation.                         |
| 43:35      | I still do just for extra coverage, get email notifications, but I don't really need to                  |
| 43:41      | pay much attention to them because I know that this list is being built and then whether                 |
| 43:45      | it's me or in the future somebody else can maybe once a day go through that and take                     |
| 43:50      | care of any follow-up that's needed.                                                                     |
| 43:53      | That's a really smart way of doing things because especially David Strip before that                     |
| 43:57      | he doesn't need an assistant because you have automation, but you can also use automation                |
| 44:02      | to make it possible to get an assistant because you can, as you're doing here, send things               |
| 44:07      | off to different places depending on who should be dealing with it or if anybody can deal                |
| 44:11      | with it versus one specific person has to deal with it.                                                  |
| 44:14      | I know for a lot of my things, I am the only person that could deal with this, but maybe                 |
| 44:18      | at some point I should consider getting some help with some of the eight million things                  |
| 44:22      | that I'm doing.                                                                                          |
| 44:23      | So I'm definitely going to bear that in mind.                                                            |
| 44:26      | And even if it were only me, it's a way of compartmentalising the things to say, okay,                   |
| 44:29      | I'm going to take 10 minutes every day and just deal with these types of issues.                         |
| 44:36      | And then the lists are already built.                                                                    |
| 44:38      | I just go to them, check them off.                                                                       |
| 44:42      | And things are taken care of.                                                                            |
| 44:43      | And then on the OmniFocus side of things, all I need to do is have an action that repeats                |
| 44:47      | maybe every weekday saying review failed orders.                                                         |
| 44:51      | And that has a link into Asana.                                                                          |
| 44:52      | I do whatever I need to do, check them complete.                                                         |
| 44:56      | And it just takes a lot of the friction out of it and keeps OmniFocus nice and clean.                    |
| 45:01      | And then it opens up the door for someone else to do that work.                                          |
| 45:03      | And even if I'm on vacation or something like that, these tasks are automatically being                  |
| 45:08      | assigned based on certain things that are happening within the website.                                  |
| 45:13      | I'm doing the same thing.                                                                                |
| 45:15      | I'm using Basecamp because I've got for a variety of reasons, but I've got people helping me             |
| 45:21      | as well.                                                                                                 |
| 45:22      | And that stuff doesn't work out of OmniFocus.                                                            |
| 45:26      | And I find a cloud service perfect for when you're working with a team that's not in your                |
| 45:31      | office every day to get what they need, to get updated statuses.                                         |
| 45:36      | And Zapier, we did a show on Zapier in the past, but Zapier is a great way because it                    |
| 45:42      | hooks into almost all of those services.                                                                 |
| 45:45      | And depending on the service, but with most of them, it's got real deep hooks.                           |
| 45:49      | I mean, creating tasks in Basecamp, for example, you can do that very easily with something              |
| 45:55      | like Zapier.                                                                                             |
| 45:57      | And that is a great way to offload work if you're working with other people.                             |
| 46:00      | I'm with you, Tim.                                                                                       |
| 46:01      | And sometimes it's the opposite direction too, whereas someone assigns you a task in                     |
| 46:06      | Basecamp and you just want to have that show up in OmniFocus, because I know that's where                |
| 46:11      | people get a little paralysed sometimes as they've got like so many places, potentially                  |
| 46:16      | that they're being assigned things to work on and they're involved in multiple companies                 |
| 46:20      | who use the variety of different collaborative systems.                                                  |
| 46:24      | So having something that takes all of those and collaborates and builds them onto one                    |
| 46:28      | list.                                                                                                    |
| 46:29      | So in my case, it would be OmniFocus, but it could be to do us, it could be things or                    |
| 46:34      | something like that, something that consolidates everything and has a link back to the assigned          |
| 46:40      | tasks.                                                                                                   |
| 46:41      | I think that can be very valuable.                                                                       |
| 46:42      | I try to have one direction for all of my task assignment.                                               |
| 46:46      | It all goes out and none of it comes back if it all possible.                                            |
| 46:50      | So I think I need to be doing more of that too.                                                          |
| 46:53      | Yes, I long for those days, hopefully in the not too distant future.                                     |
| 46:58      | But having an automation to get that stuff assigned out to keep track of it is, I think,                 |
| 47:03      | real smart.                                                                                              |
| 47:04      | Definitely.                                                                                              |
| 47:05      | And well within the capabilities of something like Zapier.                                               |
| 47:11      | Yeah, totally.                                                                                           |
| 47:13      | Another use case too is there's instances where if I get somebody filling out the customer               |
| 47:22      | support form and they have a billing-related inquiry, I try to deal with those right away.               |
| 47:27      | Occasionally, people aren't expecting a charge or something and they're calling their credit             |
| 47:30      | card company.                                                                                            |
| 47:31      | I try to kind of curb those and even if I am running things exactly the way I should                     |
| 47:38      | be, it could be like a three or four month process to resolve these things and create                    |
| 47:43      | a lot of extra work.                                                                                     |
| 47:44      | So I've got ones where if people do fill out the form and it's a billing-related inquiry,                |
| 47:49      | I'm currently using Push Over for that where the gravity forms through the Zap sends the                 |
| 47:56      | notification to Push Over and Push Over essentially builds a list of all the ones that have come         |
| 48:01      | in.                                                                                                      |
| 48:02      | So if I'm on vacation or something like that and I get something showing up in Push Over,                |
| 48:06      | I know it needs to be the first thing I've dealt with so even if I'm not checking my                     |
| 48:11      | email regularly, at least it's bringing that to the forefront and I just deal with it and                |
| 48:16      | then I remove it from the queue and Push Over and I'm good to go at that point.                          |
| 48:20      | When I meet automators, listeners at conferences and whatnot, often they're very deep into               |
| 48:26      | shortcuts and [[Keyboard Maestro]] and like TextExpander and the other kind of usual suspects               |
| 48:32      | on the Apple platforms.                                                                                  |
| 48:35      | Rarely are they trying any of this cloud stuff and I really would like you, if you're listening          |
| 48:39      | to this right now, challenge you to go out, set up and if this, then that account may                    |
| 48:44      | be teased with a Zap year.                                                                               |
| 48:46      | There was another service, African, what was it called?                                                  |
| 48:49      | Integromat.                                                                                              |
| 48:50      | Integromat, that's also getting some traction.                                                           |
| 48:53      | Play with some of these services and just see if they can solve some of your problems                    |
| 48:57      | because Tim said earlier in the show that nice thing about the online stuff is you don't                 |
| 49:01      | have to have a Mac running to make sure they work and you may find that this solves problems             |
| 49:05      | that others can't.                                                                                       |
| 49:07      | Definitely and I love the fact that these run entirely in the cloud off of my devices                    |
| 49:12      | so there's nothing for me to be concerned about there.                                                   |
| 49:16      | I don't have to make sure that I'm sitting in front of my device when the notification                   |
| 49:19      | comes in to push cut so that I can run my shortcut because Zap here has just handled the entirety        |
| 49:25      | of, for example, a new sweet setup post for me without me even thinking about it and then                |
| 49:31      | if there are things that I need to follow up on later that aren't urgent, they go into                   |
| 49:34      | my OmniFocus and urgent things get pushed over to me just like you're using push over                    |
| 49:39      | Tim.                                                                                                     |
| 49:40      | I use push cut for everything now, I have to say.                                                        |
| 49:42      | I've given up on using the alternatives.                                                                 |
| 49:44      | I was using push bullet before but everything now just comes at me through push cut.                     |
| 49:52      | One thing I do like about push over and I'm not sure if this is possible in push cut                     |
| 49:56      | but it'll actually build a list of notifications right within the app and that can be useful.            |
| 50:01      | Not typically getting that many fortunately but there is something about just instead                    |
| 50:06      | of relying on the notification centre, having its own queue that I can go through and just               |
| 50:11      | double check that if it's important enough that it ended up in push over, I want to have                 |
| 50:16      | that extra verification that has been dealt with.                                                        |
| 50:19      | I might be able to do that some other way.                                                               |
| 50:21      | I guess I could be adding them to an Asana project the way I do with the payment failures                |
| 50:26      | and things like that but yeah, it's just one of those that I've been using for several                   |
| 50:30      | years now and it's stuck.                                                                                |
| 50:34      | So Tim, which automation of all of yours gives you the most delight?                                     |
| 50:38      | Which one makes you smile every time it runs?                                                            |
| 50:41      | That's a tough call.                                                                                     |
| 50:42      | I think they all do to some extent.                                                                      |
| 50:45      | I'd have to say the one I mentioned earlier that prepared a Zoom because that used to                    |
| 50:50      | be something where I'd need to start sort of getting ready like 10, 15 minutes before                    |
| 50:56      | and there'd still be that concern that I missed something on the list because I got distracted           |
| 51:01      | and just being able to not even have to push a button but just speak a few words while                   |
| 51:06      | I'm making some tea in the kitchen or something like that and everything takes care of itself            |
| 51:10      | and yeah, I think that just feels like total magic to me and I can go on to that online                  |
| 51:15      | session just knowing that things are good to go.                                                         |
| 51:19      | Now I would like to have one of those that can also run the 15 meter ethernet cable down                 |
| 51:23      | my hallway for me because we don't have an ethernet drop point in the bedroom where I                    |
| 51:27      | record and so I've run an ethernet cable down the hallway and under the door and when                    |
| 51:31      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] can do that, then I'm going to pop open the champagne.                                  |
| 51:34      | In the meantime, it can do the software side of things nicely though.                                    |
| 51:37      | You just need to kind of use what's your vacuum cleaner called again, then maybe you can hook            |
| 51:42      | it onto that and send it down the hallway.                                                               |
| 51:44      | Yeah, it's pretty loud unfortunately, so I'm not sure that that's going to work.                         |
| 51:50      | I think there's space there for a home kit enabled cable cannon that will fire a cable                   |
| 51:56      | out of it, the end of it and if you can get the aim just right, it could land in the socket              |
| 52:02      | on the other end.                                                                                        |
| 52:03      | That would be beautiful.                                                                                 |
| 52:04      | I'm just wondering actually.                                                                             |
| 52:06      | Whenever there were these Sphero balls of like BB-8s and stuff, maybe one of those could                 |
| 52:11      | do it for me.                                                                                            |
| 52:12      | Yeah, I think a general purpose like home kit robot or something like that that could                    |
| 52:18      | not just plug in your ethernet cable but make you a cup of tea.                                          |
| 52:22      | Just ferry things around the apartment.                                                                  |
| 52:24      | You come in and you drop your bag on it and it goes off and puts it in the right place                   |
| 52:28      | for you and maybe even gets out your lunchbox to put it in the dishwasher.                               |
| 52:30      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                              |
| 52:31      | Why not, put it in?                                                                                          |
| 52:32      | I'm sure I have to laugh at it now, but I think five years from now or last, it'll probably              |
| 52:38      | be a fairly common occurrence.                                                                           |
| 52:41      | When we have our robot overlord, somebody will say, how did this get started?                            |
| 52:43      | And some will say, well, Rose Mary Orchard wanted her ethernet cable plugged in and that                 |
| 52:50      | was the beginning.                                                                                       |
| 52:52      | I apologise in advance.                                                                                  |
| 52:54      | It's not my fault.                                                                                       |
| 52:55      | I blame David.                                                                                           |
| 52:56      | There we go, I'm officially absolved of all responsibility.                                              |
| 53:01      | There you go, Tim, you are very active in both online and Mac and iOS based automation.                  |
| 53:10      | Where you talked about that 80% automation earlier and the stuff that you can almost                     |
| 53:16      | get there with, what is the 20% that you would really like to see get fixed?                             |
| 53:20      | I mean, if someone gave you power to make changes to these platforms, what would you                     |
| 53:25      | like to see improved?                                                                                    |
| 53:28      | That's a good question.                                                                                  |
| 53:30      | I think there's some instances where I need to push a button in shortcuts or something                   |
| 53:36      | like that where it'd be nice to not have that extra step.                                                |
| 53:40      | Confirmation.                                                                                            |
| 53:41      | Yeah, confirmation.                                                                                      |
| 53:42      | At the same time, I can see why Apple, I can see the logic of why they did things the way                |
| 53:46      | they did and just to protect people from themselves, I think, by adding in that extra step and people    |
| 53:52      | might complain about it, but I think there are instances where things can go off the                     |
| 53:58      | rails pretty quickly if a shortcut goes awry or something like that.                                     |
| 54:02      | The way I'd solve that is I would leave it just as it is, but I would add a preference                   |
| 54:06      | switch to say no confirmations and that way, maybe even give me a warning when I push the                |
| 54:11      | button, but there's a lot of power users out there that just don't want that and I'm one                 |
| 54:15      | of them.                                                                                                 |
| 54:16      | A compromise might be to say give a 10-second, start a 10-second timer, where if I don't                 |
| 54:22      | click cancel within 10 seconds, then it's just going to proceed, especially in cases                     |
| 54:28      | where it might be doing something potentially unwanted in some situations, I think having                |
| 54:33      | that little visual cue might make sense.                                                                 |
| 54:37      | Definitely.                                                                                              |
| 54:38      | Beyond that, I think just exposing more system services to, I find with iOS and iPadOS 13,               |
| 54:47      | there's a lot fewer sort of roadblocks where I want to do something and realise it's not                 |
| 54:54      | actually supported and I found that was happening a lot in iOS 12.                                       |
| 55:00      | For cases where it's not sort of part of the standard tool set of shortcuts, another app                 |
| 55:06      | that I've been using more and more is called Toolbox Pro and that essentially just exposes               |
| 55:13      | a lot of the features that are built into the iOS and iPadOS through this app.                           |
| 55:19      | For instance, I built a shortcut that scans a receipt and prompts me for who it's being                  |
| 55:24      | paid to and the date and it puts it into a folder in Dropbox that gets picked up by [[Hazel]]                |
| 55:29      | that puts it in the right place.                                                                         |
| 55:33      | It's giving me the same scanner that I would have if I were using the Notes app and I can                |
| 55:37      | do all the OCR and everything on it, but allowing me to build that right into a shortcut.                |
| 55:42      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 55:43      | Yeah, there is, if you haven't seen it yet, gang, and you're a shortcut user, there is                   |
| 55:48      | this crop of applications coming out where people are using the developer kit to build                   |
| 55:55      | additional tools for shortcuts that are available to developers but not necessarily surfaced             |
| 56:01      | by a particular app.                                                                                     |
| 56:03      | I think Toolbox Pro is probably the best of them, but also there's shortcuts to utilities,               |
| 56:09      | shortcut of five, there's a bunch of them and we're going to do a show on, we're definitely              |
| 56:13      | going to cover this on automators, but just there's all sorts of cool stuff you can do                   |
| 56:20      | out of Toolbox Pro and the way it works is you install the app and it's kind of like                     |
| 56:24      | when we used to get these keyboard apps for your iPhone, you download a keyboard app and                 |
| 56:29      | the app didn't really do anything, but when you went into the settings, you could enable                 |
| 56:33      | the keyboard.                                                                                            |
| 56:34      | Well, it's an app you install that doesn't really do anything, but then when you're going                |
| 56:37      | into shortcuts and you go to add a new shortcut step, there's a whole set under listing for              |
| 56:43      | Toolbox Pro and I believe Toolbox Pro is even the one that can do face ID detection, so                  |
| 56:49      | you can add, you know, this face ID just returns a yes or a no, which can be accessed by developer,      |
| 56:55      | so you can add face ID to a shortcut, you know, just like crazy, crazy stuff, but it                     |
| 57:01      | can really up your game when you're building your shortcuts.                                             |
| 57:04      | It can even do, I was noticing yesterday I was looking at it and it can even do things                   |
| 57:08      | like detect what mode of transportation I'm on, am I on a bus or driving or walking or                   |
| 57:13      | cycling or things like that, so that can actually, suddenly that functionality becomes available         |
| 57:18      | to a shortcut just from having installed this app.                                                       |
| 57:22      | Yes, my favourite action is actually detecting whether an audio is playing because the shortcut           |
| 57:27      | that I run when I get home through PushCut, it checks then through Toolbox Pro if audio                  |
| 57:33      | is playing and it only hands off to my HomePod if audio is playing and that is so useful                |
| 57:39      | because otherwise it was just setting my audio to the HomePod and then later I would go                 |
| 57:42      | to play something on my iPhone and I would be confused as to why my desk was suddenly                    |
| 57:46      | rumbling because my HomePod sits on my desk and yeah, and so now I don't have that problem              |
| 57:52      | because it only hands off the audio playing if I'm listening to something and that works                 |
| 57:58      | great for me.                                                                                            |
| 57:59      | And we're just a couple months into this, I mean, by the way, if you're a shortcuts                      |
| 58:04      | field guide customer, I'm working on some videos on this stuff so that course will get                   |
| 58:09      | updated for these, but it's just like, I feel like we're just starting, there's going to                 |
| 58:14      | be even more of these apps and like, [[Adam Tow]], our friend that we've talked to on the                    |
| 58:21      | show has got stuff he's working on, there's a whole bunch of cool stuff coming out for                   |
| 58:25      | shortcuts and this is exactly what we get because Apple opened it up to third-party                      |
| 58:30      | development.                                                                                             |
| 58:31      | I mean, I'm so happy with what they've done with shortcuts.                                              |
| 58:34      | I mean, the fact that we're having a conversation about realistically using iOS as an automation         |
| 58:40      | tool is really because of what's happened with shortcuts.                                                |
| 58:44      | Agreed.                                                                                                  |
| 58:45      | And I think this is part of a shift from apps being kind of the focus of attention to apps               |
| 58:51      | being still very important, but something that provides more of a service where it's                     |
| 58:56      | going to be, I think, become more and more focused on what do you want to do and the                     |
| 59:00      | apps that are providing that functionality in the background become, they're still very                  |
| 59:06      | important, but they don't, we're not talking about the apps, we're talking about sort of                 |
| 59:10      | the tasks, if that makes sense.                                                                          |
| 59:12      | So really what I want to do is, you know, get into my car and go to my next destination                  |
| 59:17      | while listening to podcasts and I almost don't even need to know what app is playing the                 |
| 59:22      | podcast and what app is providing the navigation and so forth.                                           |
| 59:27      | It's more important that the technology is delivering on the objective there.                            |
| 59:32      | I have to agree.                                                                                         |
| 59:33      | So, for example, one that's especially pertinent to you, Tim, is OmniFocus recently added some           |
| 59:39      | extra shortcut support and there is a little bit of a thing with shortcuts because OmniFocus             |
| 59:45      | was popular before, shortcuts built-in actions for them, but it's still using the old OmniFocus          |
| 59:51      | information from way back with contacts instead of tags, but they've got this new action                 |
| 59:56      | called Find Items, which I'm really liking and I'm wondering if you're using that as                     |
| 01:00:00   | well.                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:01   | I've just started to play with that a bit.                                                               |
| 01:00:06   | It's one of those that is still relatively new.                                                          |
| 01:00:09   | I haven't necessarily found, surfaced all of the use cases for it, but I'm really happy                  |
| 01:00:15   | to know it's there and I'm sure I will be making good use of it, but yeah, sometimes                     |
| 01:00:21   | I get used to doing things in the older way and I need to remind myself of these new ways                |
| 01:00:27   | of doing things and revisit my current automations and say, could I modernise this?                      |
| 01:00:32   | Could I make them more convenient?                                                                       |
| 01:00:34   | And there's other cases where I have kind of an older way of doing something with an                     |
| 01:00:37   | automation that's working just fine, so I don't necessarily give those the attention                     |
| 01:00:41   | because there's already a working solution in place.                                                     |

| 01:02:20   | I'm using this action actually in that same when I get home shortcut that I talked about                 |
| 01:02:24   | before, if there are tasks that I have marked, so I have a tag of when I get home.                       |
| 01:02:30   | And I had tried previously adding a location trigger to this and OmniFocus, but as we mentioned          |
| 01:02:35   | in our IDKN episode, location triggers are just so large that even on the smallest setting,              |
| 01:02:41   | it was notifying me outside of my home and I was forgetting about things.                                |
| 01:02:45   | So I've now got it to check when I run my I'm home shortcut.                                             |
| 01:02:49   | It checks whether or not there are any tasks with this tag, and then it will show them                   |
| 01:02:53   | to me if there are any tasks with that tag.                                                              |
| 01:02:55   | If there aren't any tasks with that tag, then it just doesn't show me anything.                          |
| 01:02:59   | Because I then run a keyboard, my stream macro on my Mac, which opens up my at home tag.                 |
| 01:03:06   | So that's everything that's available at home, but it's not something that has to be                     |
| 01:03:09   | done as soon as I get home.                                                                              |
| 01:03:11   | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 01:03:12   | So, so Rosie, you can't just say that.                                                                   |
| 01:03:13   | Now you got to explain a little bit about it.                                                            |
| 01:03:15   | So Mike, I'm guessing you're running was it an if statement on the find in OmniFocus?                    |
| 01:03:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:03:22   | So find tasks in OmniFocus, you can filter for all sorts of things like tags and projects                |
| 01:03:26   | and available and completed items, even all sorts.                                                       |
| 01:03:30   | And then I just do an if, and then it says if items, because that's what the find items                  |
| 01:03:37   | action produces.                                                                                         |
| 01:03:38   | And I just say has any value, that's what it defaults to, and that works perfectly for                   |
| 01:03:42   | my use case.                                                                                             |
| 01:03:44   | And then I just have a show result action, because if I ever wanted to run this on my                    |
| 01:03:49   | HomePod, I could, and it would theoretically then speak these things to me.                             |
| 01:03:54   | And yes, then it just goes in there.                                                                     |
| 01:03:57   | And the running the keyboard, my stream macro, as Tim mentioned earlier, it's a get contents             |
| 01:04:02   | of URL to just get the contents of the URL, which doesn't do anything on the shortcuts                   |
| 01:04:07   | side, but it aside from tell the URL that it's been called.                                              |
| 01:04:11   | And then the URL magic.                                                                                  |
| 01:04:13   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:14   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:15   | And this might be a good case to use that when we're talking about earlier than push                     |
| 01:04:18   | cuts, where you can have a delayed notification, especially if you don't have eye beacons,               |
| 01:04:24   | you could say when I'm in the general area of my home, maybe even wait 15 minutes and                    |
| 01:04:31   | display that the home tasks, you know, once I know I've gotten at the time to go up the                  |
| 01:04:36   | elevator and take off my jacket and things like that, because it can almost be a bit                     |
| 01:04:40   | jarring, I think, to come home and then be presented with a list of tasks.                               |
| 01:04:44   | And I'd rather have a little time to settle in before, you know, having that pop up on                   |
| 01:04:49   | the screen.                                                                                              |
| 01:04:50   | So I think that's another really good use of that delayed notification.                                  |
| 01:04:55   | And if you did happen to just come home for a moment because you forgot your gloves or                   |
| 01:04:59   | something like that, it's maybe not even going to trigger because you're not in a position               |
| 01:05:04   | where you're able to do anything at home because you're just there very, very briefly.                   |
| 01:05:10   | That's a really good trick.                                                                              |
| 01:05:12   | So Tim, we just released an episode on eye beacons and you've mentioned it several times                 |
| 01:05:16   | in the show.                                                                                             |
| 01:05:17   | As I understand, you've got one now in your car, you've got one in your co-working space.                |
| 01:05:25   | Where else do you have your eye beacons?                                                                 |
| 01:05:27   | Then I have one in the office as well, the three main ones.                                              |
| 01:05:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:31   | And I think they're going to be more in my future and just sort of starting to get my                    |
| 01:05:36   | head around the different uses for these things and I have been tempted as you talked                    |
| 01:05:41   | about in [[EP038 - Simon Leeb and Pushcut\|the episode]] with [[Simon Leeb\|Simon]] to plant some in public spaces.                                          |
| 01:05:45   | But fortunately, I've come up with some alternatives to that, just different ways of triggering          |
| 01:05:50   | location wear things.                                                                                    |
| 01:05:52   | But yeah, I'm quite kind of fascinated by the possibilities that they open up.                           |
| 01:05:57   | And yeah, I'm just, I think Rose, you take one traveling with you as well in your suitcase.              |
| 01:06:02   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:03   | Yes, I do.                                                                                               |
| 01:06:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:05   | I think I still have one eye beacon that's not called for, so I think that'll be going                   |
| 01:06:08   | in the suitcase.                                                                                         |
| 01:06:09   | Which manufacturer did you go with?                                                                      |
| 01:06:12   | The Estimote ones, which I think you recommended Rose back in the day.                                   |
| 01:06:15   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:16   | And they're quite sophisticated.                                                                         |
| 01:06:18   | I guess some of them are very, very simple, but these will even sense like the temperature               |
| 01:06:22   | and things in the space they're in and do some fairly fancy things beyond the more sort                  |
| 01:06:28   | of basic functionality.                                                                                  |
| 01:06:30   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:31   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:32   | That's the ones recommended in the eye beacon episode as well.                                           |
| 01:06:35   | And for me, they work great.                                                                             |
| 01:06:36   | They have an advertised battery life of two years and mine have definitely held out like                 |
| 01:06:40   | two and a half, I think.                                                                                 |
| 01:06:43   | And so I replaced the batteries in mine recently.                                                        |
| 01:06:45   | One of them died and I noticed my home automation stopped running and I just ordered batteries           |
| 01:06:50   | and replaced all of them.                                                                                |
| 01:06:52   | You can replace the batteries in those, which is very useful.                                            |
| 01:06:54   | Oh yeah, you can.                                                                                        |
| 01:06:55   | They don't make it very obvious that you can do that, but I think you just pull the sticker              |
| 01:06:59   | off.                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:00   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:02   | I hadn't actually stuck the sticker part onto anything because I keep moving mine around                 |
| 01:07:05   | the one on my desk currently lives in a mug, but it previously lived in a desk drawer.                   |
| 01:07:09   | It may go back to the desk drawer if I end up with more pens and so it doesn't fit in                    |
| 01:07:12   | the mug anymore.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:13   | But you don't need to stick it to anything if you don't want to, but you can just peel                   |
| 01:07:17   | off that sticky pad and replace the battery inside of it.                                                |
| 01:07:20   | And the nice thing about having those while traveling is you're kind of creating your                    |
| 01:07:23   | own fence fence without having to put in like the location, the hotel or something like                    |
| 01:07:28   | that.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:29   | It's kind of a portable sort of homing beacon in a sense.                                                |
| 01:07:34   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:35   | They are a bit bulky though.                                                                             |
| 01:07:36   | I find the Estimote ones.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:37   | I don't know.                                                                                            |
| 01:07:38   | There might be ones that are a bit more compact if you're traveling very light.                          |
| 01:07:42   | I've been playing with some Gigaset ones, but the Gigaset ones I found are much more                     |
| 01:07:47   | like tile beacons.                                                                                       |
| 01:07:49   | And I'm struggling actually to get the UU idea of these because I have too many iBeacons                 |
| 01:07:53   | running around.                                                                                          |
| 01:07:54   | And so I don't actually know which one belongs to the Gigaset, one that I've been experimenting          |
| 01:08:00   | with, but it's about the same size as a tile.                                                            |
| 01:08:02   | It's just a lot cheaper.                                                                                 |
| 01:08:04   | Well, I think that's not going to be the end of iBeacon discussion on automators.                        |
| 01:08:09   | I doubt it.                                                                                              |
| 01:08:10   | I think there'll be a, since they're not officially like supported by shortcuts, I think there'll        |
| 01:08:14   | be a little bit of a fringe technology for now, but they are, if anyone's interested,                    |
| 01:08:20   | it is quite easy to get up and running with them.                                                        |
| 01:08:23   | It essentially just becomes another location once you add it to something like PushCutt.                 |
| 01:08:28   | And then you can just treat it like you would a fence fence that's using the GPS.                          |
| 01:08:33   | And the ability to set the transmission strength really gives you like a third dimension to              |
| 01:08:40   | to a trigger that you don't have otherwise.                                                              |
| 01:08:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:43   | So you can have a trigger when you walk into the room instead of when I walk into the building.          |
| 01:08:48   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                           |
| 01:08:49   | All right.                                                                                               |

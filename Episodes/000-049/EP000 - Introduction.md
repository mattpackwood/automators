| 00:00      | Rosemary, we're going to make a podcast.                       |
| 00:04      | Yes, we are.                                                   |
| 00:06      | Welcome to the Automators.                                     |
| 00:07      | or I guess, Automators.                                        |
| 00:09      | We don't have the in it,                                       |
| 00:11      | but it's hard for me not to do that.                           |
| 00:12      | But anyway, welcome to the Automators.                         |
| 00:15      | Yes, welcome.                                                  |
| 00:16      | Rosemary and I have been talking for some time about making    |
| 00:20      | a podcast just about helping people get better at automation.  |
| 00:24      | We're having a little fun with this episode zero.              |
| 00:26      | We are me-mojifying ourselves.                                 |
| 00:29      | If you'd like to watch us talk about this via memoji,          |
| 00:33      | there's a link in the show notes go there right now,           |
| 00:35      | and you can see it and I'm going to do a bunch of editing      |
| 00:38      | and hopefully make something that looks cool at the end.       |
| 00:41      | Either way, we are making a show about automation.             |
| 00:45      | Why are we making this show, Rosemary?                         |
| 00:47      | Well, everybody can automate something in their lives.         |
| 00:50      | Automation is great.                                           |
| 00:51      | It can do all sorts of things.                                 |
| 00:52      | It could just save you time,                                   |
| 00:53      | could save you energy,                                         |
| 00:55      | it can make things more accurate.                              |
| 00:56      | But the whole point of it is making your devices work for you. |
| 01:00      | The machine doesn't work you anymore.                          |
| 01:02      | You work the machine to make it do the smart stuff.            |
| 01:05      | And that's what we want to help everybody do.                  |
| 01:08      | Yeah, we want you to become the boss of your computer.         |
| 01:10      | And I think there's this thing about automation                |
| 01:12      | where a lot of people think,                                   |
| 01:13      | oh, I'm not a programmer.                                      |
| 01:15      | I don't really understand computers.                           |
| 01:17      | I can't do stuff like that.                                    |
| 01:19      | And the fact is you can,                                       |
| 01:21      | because Apple makes it really easy                             |
| 01:23      | for a lot of the stuff to be implemented.                      |
| 01:25      | There's some great app developers out there                    |
| 01:27      | that have made some apps to help you do it.                    |
| 01:29      | You don't need to know a lick of programming.                  |
| 01:32      | We're never going to be talking about hello world here.        |
| 01:35      | You just show up, listen to us.                                |
| 01:38      | We're going to do a half hour episode every two weeks.         |
| 01:40      | We're going to pick one topic.                                 |
| 01:42      | And the best part is once we publish it,                       |
| 01:44      | not only do you get to listen to the show,                     |
| 01:46      | we're going to give you as much of this automation             |
| 01:49      | that we talk about that's possible.                            |
| 01:50      | So you could even just say, heck with it,                      |
| 01:53      | I'm just going to download Rosemary and David's work           |
| 01:56      | and just copy it.                                              |
| 01:57      | We're okay with that.                                          |
| 01:58      | Definitely, and actually do that.                              |
| 02:00      | And if you are a little bit more advanced already              |
| 02:03      | with automation or you're ready to get on                      |
| 02:05      | and experiment with the stuff,                                 |
| 02:07      | go ahead, play with it.                                        |
| 02:08      | If you break it, no big deal.                                  |
| 02:09      | You can download it again.                                     |
| 02:11      | Yeah, and honestly,                                            |
| 02:12      | even if you're not experienced with this stuff,                |
| 02:14      | once you see how easy it is                                    |
| 02:16      | when you download the sample automations,                      |
| 02:18      | you're going to want to go in there                            |
| 02:21      | and mess around with it anyway.                                |
| 02:23      | Because it's so easy.                                          |
| 02:24      | Once you get in there, you can just tweak it a little bit.     |
| 02:26      | And once you make that first tweak, you're hooked.             |
| 02:29      | You're going to have a great time.                             |
| 02:30      | So our goal here is to help you get better                     |
| 02:33      | at running your computers and iPhones.                         |
| 02:35      | And it's not just limited to that, though.                     |
| 02:37      | We're going to also talk about home automation                 |
| 02:39      | and other stuff as well.                                       |
| 02:40      | But we want you to automate your life                          |
| 02:42      | and we want to help you do it.                                 |
| 02:43      | Show's going to be around 30 minutes.                          |
| 02:46      | It's going to come out every two weeks.                        |
| 02:48      | And we're releasing it on Fridays.                             |
| 02:49      | The idea is we're going to give you                            |
| 02:51      | a little weekend project every time you download an episode.   |
| 02:54      | Hopefully, it will inspire you to automate something           |
| 02:57      | for your first weekend.                                        |
| 02:59      | So as soon as upcoming Friday,                                 |
| 03:02      | we'll be releasing the first episode.                          |
| 03:05      | It's all about automating your calendar and calendar events.   |
| 03:08      | It's a great episode with some great tips.                     |
| 03:10      | And we can't wait to share it with you.                        |
| 03:12      | Yes, it's going to be lots of fun.                             |
| 03:14      | And you're going to be surprised at how much                   |
| 03:15      | you can automate with calendar events.                         |
| 03:18      | All right, Rose, let's go make a podcast together.             |
| 03:20      | Yes.                                                           |

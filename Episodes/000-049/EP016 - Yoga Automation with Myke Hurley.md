| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, a show about automating your Mac iPad and just about anything         |
| 00:07      | else you own.                                                                                           |
| 00:08      | I'm David Sparks, and along with me is my pal, Rose Mary Orchard.                                       |
| 00:11      | How you doing, Rose?                                                                                    |
| 00:12      | I am great today, David.                                                                                |
| 00:13      | How are you?                                                                                            |
| 00:14      | Good.                                                                                                   |
| 00:15      | And we have a guest today.                                                                              |
| 00:16      | Welcome to the show, Mr. Michael Hurley.                                                                |
| 00:18      | Oh, thank you for the full name introduction, David.                                                    |
| 00:21      | David Sparks.                                                                                           |
| 00:22      | I can't help myself.                                                                                    |
| 00:23      | I just do that.                                                                                         |
| 00:24      | It's because of Rose Mary, because Rose, you have the best name to say in full.                         |
| 00:31      | I know, I know.                                                                                         |
| 00:32      | And I love it.                                                                                          |
| 00:33      | Everyone likes to call you Rose Mary Orchard, because what a name it is, right?                         |
| 00:36      | So now I'm Michael Hurley.                                                                              |
| 00:38      | In my head, she's Rose, but when I say that, well, I can't help but say Rose Mary.                      |
| 00:44      | Well, there we go.                                                                                      |
| 00:46      | What do you prefer, Rose Mary?                                                                          |
| 00:49      | I answer to both, and I actually like both equally.                                                     |
| 00:53      | I think both sounds really nice, so I can't argue with that.                                            |
| 00:59      | Well, good on your parents.                                                                             |
| 01:00      | Good on them.                                                                                           |
| 01:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:02      | Hey, we're not here to talk about Rose Mary's name, though.                                             |
| 01:05      | We're here to talk about automation.                                                                    |
| 01:07      | And Mike, you are a very particular guest, and we're very excited to have you on the                    |
| 01:11      | show.                                                                                                   |
| 01:12      | And one of the reasons I like having you on the show, Mike, is that you are, you know,                  |
| 01:17      | you're one of us.                                                                                       |
| 01:18      | You're not somebody like [[Sal Soghoian]], you know, or [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]], who spends hours and hours                 |
| 01:25      | planning out automation, but you're a guy who gets his work done.                                       |
| 01:29      | And I know for a fact from our friendship that you are constantly looking for ways to                   |
| 01:33      | use automation to make everything a little easier.                                                      |
| 01:36      | And that's, you know, that's what we're looking for with this show, you know.                           |
| 01:38      | We're not looking for everybody to take over Sal's job, but we are looking for all our                  |
| 01:43      | listeners to be able to ease the process a little bit in their life.                                    |
| 01:48      | And that's why I thought it'd be fun to have you on.                                                    |
| 01:49      | Well, I guess one of the things for me is like you mentioned, I come always looking,                    |
| 01:53      | and I am always looking for ways to try and make things run a bit smoother, but most of                 |
| 01:57      | the time without the tools to know how to do it.                                                        |
| 02:00      | Right.                                                                                                  |
| 02:01      | So like, I just, I can't sit down sometimes in front of an app or a program or whatever                 |
| 02:07      | and like just work it out, you know, like someone like a [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] can, like [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]],                   |
| 02:13      | like he can just sit down in front of shortcuts and just make it happen where I'm, I don't              |
| 02:20      | really have the skill completely to do it on my own and sometimes I need to like make                   |
| 02:25      | these Frankenstein creations for other people's work or just beg and plead my friends to help           |
| 02:32      | me.                                                                                                     |
| 02:33      | But there's nothing wrong with doing that.                                                              |
| 02:34      | I mean, that's kind of part of the fun, you know, like taking something that does most                  |
| 02:38      | of what you want or half of what you want and sticking it together or something else,                   |
| 02:41      | you know, if it gets the job done, who cares?                                                           |
| 02:44      | Right.                                                                                                  |
| 02:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:46      | If you look at all the MacSparky archives of all the [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] I've published over                 |
| 02:49      | the years, very few of those did I start from scratch, you know, almost all of them                     |
| 02:55      | started with me going out on the internet and finding somebody that solved a similar                    |
| 02:58      | problem and then making adjustments.                                                                    |
| 03:03      | And I think that's true for iOS too.                                                                    |
| 03:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 03:05      | And I totally understand like this is a thing in development, right?                                    |
| 03:07      | Like Stack Overflow where other people just Google a thing and then they find something                 |
| 03:11      | and it helps them get through.                                                                          |
| 03:12      | This is what people like Casey Liss tell me all the time when I make these complaints                   |
| 03:16      | about myself.                                                                                           |
| 03:18      | But now when you, because I mean, you started on a Mac before you became, you know, one                 |
| 03:24      | of the iPad guys.                                                                                       |
| 03:26      | How involved were you with automation in your Mac days?                                                 |
| 03:31      | Not very.                                                                                               |
| 03:32      | I mean, so my Mac life began in 2005 and, you know, I kind of had spent at that time                    |
| 03:41      | there's like 18 years old of my first Mac.                                                              |
| 03:44      | I would spend a lot of time just tinkering around, you know, like just like, what does                  |
| 03:50      | this do?                                                                                                |
| 03:51      | What does this do?                                                                                      |
| 03:52      | And I used to watch some, some listeners might remember this before, well, [[MacBreak Weekly]]                    |
| 03:58      | is a podcast and has been a podcast for a long time, but there was also a video                  |
| 04:03      | series called MacBreak, which went alongside with it.                                                  |
| 04:06      | And I remember it's like the first time I ever saw [[Sal Soghoian]] was like on MacBreak                     |
| 04:09      | and he was talking about [[Automator]].                                                                |
| 04:11      | So like I spent some time trying to understand [[Automator]].                                                |
| 04:14      | I built some like renaming, automata actions, you know, like file renaming stuff, like the              |
| 04:20      | most basic, but like everyone seems to kind of begin with, but it never really clicked                  |
| 04:24      | for me.                                                                                                 |
| 04:25      | So, you know, I've never tinkered with [[AppleScript]].                                                    |
| 04:29      | I don't have any automata actions that I run.                                                           |
| 04:31      | I own [[Hazel]] and [[Hazel]] does like a couple of super simple things for me.                                 |
| 04:35      | Like, so right now we are talking on Skype and because whenever I'm talking on Skype,                   |
| 04:41      | I'm typically recording a podcast.                                                                      |
| 04:43      | I have Skype core recorder, the app that I use, automatically record the files and drop                 |
| 04:49      | them in a folder.                                                                                       |
| 04:50      | And I just have [[Hazel]] watch that folder and every three months it deletes files that are                |
| 04:54      | older than, you know, like, so like, so every three months it deletes old files, you know,              |
| 04:59      | stuff like that.                                                                                        |
| 05:00      | So it's like a rolling list.                                                                            |
| 05:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 05:02      | I think we call that that podcaster [[Hazel]] rule.                                                         |
| 05:04      | It eventually gets that one.                                                                            |
| 05:07      | You've got to get it because I've, you know, who thinks about deleting those files.                     |
| 05:10      | And then I also have some like, [[Federico Viticci]] made as many of the things that I used [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]]         |
| 05:17      | made these [[Hazel]] scripts or like detailed these [[Hazel]] scripts years ago for photo management            |
| 05:22      | that I still use.                                                                                       |
| 05:24      | So I have, I have [[Dropbox]] like uploading my file, my photos from my iPhone and this just                |
| 05:30      | like takes those and sorts them into year and date and just puts them into different                    |
| 05:35      | folders.                                                                                                |
| 05:36      | And it's one of those things that I literally never use this, but I have two terabytes of               |
| 05:39      | [[Dropbox]] space and the script work.                                                                      |
| 05:42      | So I just leave it going.                                                                               |
| 05:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 05:44      | It's a backup.                                                                                          |
| 05:45      | I mean, but that's the kind of thing that, you know, that if you ever need to look back                 |
| 05:49      | at your photos and you're like, I know this happened in 2017.                                           |
| 05:51      | Exactly.                                                                                                |
| 05:52      | So you can look back and you can just look at 2017 and that narrows it down so much.                    |
| 05:57      | And just having a consistent naming format of probably I'm guessing it's going to be                    |
| 06:00      | date time as the naming format or something along those lines, then, you know, that makes               |
| 06:06      | it really easy to look at.                                                                              |
| 06:07      | And that's something that everybody can use.                                                            |
| 06:10      | So I would argue that one of the challenges with automation on the Mac is that it is really             |
| 06:16      | not as friendly as automation is on iOS because AppleScript, you know, it's a little bit               |
| 06:22      | of an oddball.                                                                                          |
| 06:23      | And you have to, in trying to make it natural language, sometimes it gets harder for people.            |
| 06:30      | And it is, it's a skill you have to learn.                                                              |
| 06:33      | It's not something that you can just start pulling blocks together.                                     |
| 06:35      | I think that's kind of why a cell wanted to make Automator to begin with.                               |
| 06:40      | And then when you contrast Automator to workflow, which turned into Siri shortcuts on iOS, I            |
| 06:48      | don't think Apple gave cell enough resources or support to build out Automator the way                  |
| 06:54      | we would have all liked to have seen it, you know, and where it's workflow and Siri shortcuts           |
| 07:00      | really is much more far reaching for someone like you who just wants to kind of like get                |
| 07:06      | a little, get a little me and dip their toes in the water a bit with the stuff.                         |
| 07:09      | There's a lot more you can do on iOS.                                                                   |
| 07:12      | Well, I mean, let's just have a really obvious comparison.                                              |
| 07:16      | You can still.                                                                                          |
| 07:17      | You have pretty much always been able to, as far as I know, be able to create Automator                 |
| 07:20      | actions.                                                                                                |
| 07:21      | Microsoft discontinued their Automator actions like a couple of versions ago.                           |
| 07:26      | This last year, Siri shortcuts was announced.                                                           |
| 07:28      | And now practically every app I use has some kind of Siri shortcut, including some ridiculously         |
| 07:34      | unuseful ones, which things like message my mom, I'll call you in a five minutes.                       |
| 07:38      | Like, I just messaged that and then I called her.                                                       |
| 07:41      | So it's like, I'm not going to need to use that one again.                                              |
| 07:43      | Thanks Siri.                                                                                            |
| 07:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 07:45      | So just looking at the uptake of it, I mean, partly, of course, it's down to the user base.             |
| 07:50      | There's a lot of users there, but I think it really is the chicken versus the egg problem               |
| 07:53      | because workflow already had this user base and all of these great actions and the support              |
| 07:59      | from like the automation nerd community.                                                                |
| 08:03      | You know, other people were willing to jump on board because the users were already there.              |
| 08:08      | And so, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 08:09      | So Mike, when did you see the light about automation on iOS?                                            |
| 08:13      | I mean, at some point, it became a thing for you, right?                                                |
| 08:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 08:17      | I mean, I had spent time tinkering around with IFTTT, right?                                            |
| 08:21      | Like, all of these services, like most nerds, they pop up and you sign up and you play around           |
| 08:27      | with them.                                                                                              |
| 08:28      | And, you know, I kind of had an idea for some stuff that it did.                                        |
| 08:31      | I set up some IFTTT actions that I will mention later on as, you know, because I know you're            |
| 08:37      | going to ask me for some examples of things that I use every day.                                       |
| 08:41      | But then for me, really, everything clicked with workflow.                                              |
| 08:47      | That was when I started to be much more interested in playing around with automation, even though       |
| 08:55      | I ended up with doing a lot of things that aren't done with workflow, you know, like using              |
| 09:00      | Zapier and stuff like that.                                                                             |
| 09:02      | It was the way that workflow broke everything down and enabled me to play around and build              |
| 09:08      | these weird and wonderful things, like making my computer do something where I wasn't interacting       |
| 09:13      | with it.                                                                                                |
| 09:14      | That kind of made me realise that such a thing as automated computer automation could be achieved       |
| 09:19      | by me.                                                                                                  |
| 09:21      | And then once I kind of started on that path, I started looking for tools that will like                |
| 09:26      | it.                                                                                                     |
| 09:27      | And that was how I ended up stumbling upon Zapier for web stuff.                                        |
| 09:31      | And then eventually, you know, it all got better with shortcuts.                                        |
| 09:35      | But really, that is kind of workflow was my introduction into this stuff, because it gave               |
| 09:41      | me a system and a framework that I could work in that I can understand, but then also helped            |
| 09:47      | enable me to think in terms of I have a problem to solve.                                               |
| 09:54      | Can the computer do it for me, as opposed to me manually completing it?                                 |
| 10:01      | You know?                                                                                               |
| 10:02      | Like, we talk often about, you know, with respect to TextExpander, you know, if you                    |
| 10:06      | find yourself typing the same thing two or three times, can you text automate that?                     |
| 10:11      | I always forget TextExpander.                                                                          |
| 10:12      | I've obviously been using TextExpander forever.                                                        |
| 10:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 10:16      | Right.                                                                                                  |
| 10:17      | Like all the way back in the day of like downloading, I think like if a [[Brett Terpstra]] or Sean          |
| 10:21      | Blanc made like a typical Apple product correct spelling corrections set of words,                      |
| 10:28      | like, I've used TextExpander forever, but it is one of those things, you know, everybody               |
| 10:33      | says this, I know, but I've used it so much that it just feels like part of the system.                 |
| 10:40      | Like I even have it on my PC now, which is great.                                                       |
| 10:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 10:43      | But, you know, that same logic applies, I think, on iOS now with these web services                     |
| 10:50      | and with Siri shortcuts that you catch yourself doing something repeatedly if you can get               |
| 10:57      | that trigger in your brain that says, huh, maybe I could automate this quite often you                  |
| 11:01      | can.                                                                                                    |
| 11:02      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 11:03      | Most definitely.                                                                                        |
| 11:04      | So let's talk about some of the things you're doing.                                                    |
| 11:09      | The, I want to talk about Zapier and IFTTT later because like despite your protestations                |
| 11:14      | that you're not a big automator, the fact that using web automation puts you pretty                     |
| 11:19      | far down the rabbit hole, my friend.                                                                    |
| 11:21      | But yeah.                                                                                               |
| 11:22      | So we're going to talk about that in a minute, but the, but before we get to that, let's talk           |
| 11:26      | about Siri shortcuts.                                                                                   |
| 11:28      | How are you using Siri shortcuts to get through your day?                                               |
| 11:31      | Oh, I mean, so many ways.                                                                               |
| 11:33      | All right.                                                                                              |
| 11:34      | So would you like some like examples of stuff that I'm doing?                                           |
| 11:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 11:38      | Start at the top of your day and walk us through like a couple of shortcuts that you use like           |
| 11:41      | at various different times.                                                                             |
| 11:43      | So I have a handful of shortcuts that I leave in the notification centre widget, right?                 |
| 11:48      | Like they're the ones that I'm using the most.                                                          |
| 11:51      | So my first acted upon Siri shortcut every day is disable alarms.                                       |
| 11:57      | I do not wake up easily and set, I'm not kidding, about 17 or 18 alarms on like 15 minute increments.   |
| 12:09      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 12:10      | I've had situations in my life where I will sleep for a very, very long time unless something           |
| 12:16      | is unless a computer will help me.                                                                      |
| 12:19      | So because of the amount of alarms that I set, you can imagine my joy when Siri shortcuts               |
| 12:27      | got, you were able to do a lot of work with alarms.                                                     |
| 12:31      | So I have a morning alarms and disabled alarms are two different shortcuts and they quite               |
| 12:36      | simply I just tap them and they either turn on all the alarms that I need and then turn                 |
| 12:40      | the press the other one to turn off all the alarms that I need.                                         |
| 12:43      | So it's just like a very simple thing, but I love it.                                                   |
| 12:45      | And if you're not, if you're not aware of that, that was an update in 1.1 of Siri shortcuts             |
| 12:49      | where before it was like, you had to discover an alarm, you had to set it and then yeah,                |
| 12:54      | and then they completely broke it at one point.                                                         |
| 12:58      | And then like you would tap it and no matter what you did, it would always open the app                 |
| 13:03      | and make you watch every alarm be set.                                                                  |
| 13:05      | Like it was a bit wonky for a while, but like, yeah, in 1.1, not only did they add the ability,         |
| 13:11      | I think basically they've rewrote that part and they added the ability for you to in Siri               |
| 13:17      | shortcuts, there's just a native, well in shortcuts, there's a native action to allow                   |
| 13:21      | you to add an alarm in as opposed to just doing that thing where you'd have to toggle                   |
| 13:25      | alarms on and off and hope that they get donated to the system.                                         |
| 13:28      | Yeah, that was slightly ridiculous.                                                                     |
| 13:31      | Have you ever considered combining those into one shortcut, which just checks the time of               |
| 13:35      | day and if it's, you know, say before 2pm, then it turns them off and if it's after                     |
| 13:40      | 2pm, it turns them on for you?                                                                          |
| 13:42      | Not until now, Rose.                                                                                    |
| 13:43      | Not until now.                                                                                          |
| 13:44      | Okay, there we go.                                                                                      |
| 13:45      | That's a possible upgrade for you.                                                                      |
| 13:47      | Rose will do that to you.                                                                               |
| 13:49      | Interesting.                                                                                            |
| 13:50      | See, because this is the thing where it's like, where I think of myself or I feel like I'm              |
| 13:54      | getting better at this stuff.                                                                           |
| 13:55      | When you said that, I was like, I have no idea how you do that.                                         |
| 13:57      | And then I just spent like 15 seconds, like having my brain churn on it, it's like, oh,                 |
| 14:02      | I think I know how I could do that.                                                                     |
| 14:04      | I don't think it would be very elegant, but I feel like I know a way to do it, right?                   |
| 14:09      | And this is the beauty of workflows, the magic variables.                                               |
| 14:13      | That was the big change for me.                                                                         |
| 14:14      | Magic variables were the huge change because it gave me that kind of power and control                  |
| 14:20      | of the variable in a language I could understand, which is visual.                                      |
| 14:25      | And being able to like, just choose those little, little kind of pill shaped guys and                   |
| 14:31      | popping them in where they need to go is really something that helped me out a lot.                     |
| 14:35      | And it continues to help me out today because I mean, that's, that's what I would do if                 |
| 14:38      | I was going to create a shortcut like that.                                                             |
| 14:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 14:41      | Well, I mean, just to, to tell the listeners how I would do this with your, your two examples,          |
| 14:45      | I would get the current time, I would format it to just the hour and that's H H and then                |
| 14:51      | I would do an if and if it's less than whatever the hours that you put in there, I would run            |
| 14:55      | the shortcut to turn the alarms off and else I would run the shortcut to turn the alarms                |
| 14:59      | on because then you've still got those two shortcuts.                                                   |
| 15:01      | So you would keep two separate shortcuts and then just have the one kind of master shortcut             |
| 15:07      | which can pull from either of those, which is the one that sits in your notification                    |
| 15:11      | centre to give you more space.                                                                          |
| 15:12      | But then that also means that you can include those two shortcuts in any other shortcuts                |
| 15:16      | if you need to or want to in the future, or you can modify it without having to scroll                  |
| 15:21      | through 525 actions or so that's the thing, the, the run shortcut shortcut action.                      |
| 15:27      | So this is where you're able to chew.                                                                   |
| 15:30      | You're able to at any point run another shortcut inside of a shortcut and you just get to choose        |
| 15:34      | which one it is from your existing list is both a blessing and a curse.                                 |
| 15:38      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 15:39      | It's a wonderful thing to have, but it also means that the amount of shortcuts that you                 |
| 15:44      | have exponentially increases still with no real way of sorting them.                                    |
| 15:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 15:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 15:52      | I, I, my, my sorting mechanism is called the search and that's basically all I do now.                  |
| 15:58      | Like either I know something's near the top or I search for it because by the time I scroll             |
| 16:03      | down 800 shortcuts, like that's not happening today.                                                    |
| 16:07      | I was going to say anything that I'm using frequently will go into notification centre.                 |
| 16:12      | Oh, sorry.                                                                                              |
| 16:13      | Like into the, um, at the extension in today, which is it today, widget, there you go.                  |
| 16:18      | The names have changed so much that I have lost complete like understanding of how to                   |
| 16:22      | name those things.                                                                                      |
| 16:23      | So yeah, they all go into the widget.                                                                   |
| 16:26      | Anything else I'm going in and searching for, but it's more rare that I have to do that.                |
| 16:31      | I also use a lot of, um, shortcuts from the action, uh, extension.                                      |
| 16:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 16:37      | So like I have one where like my accountant, uh, re just at some point required me to use               |
| 16:43      | this app, this like service for my receipts, which I really didn't want to do.                          |
| 16:48      | Everything was going into a [[Dropbox]] folder and then I was just giving him a link to a                   |
| 16:51      | [[Dropbox]] folder every month and that was like great for me, right?                                       |
| 16:54      | Cause that's nothing.                                                                                   |
| 16:55      | There's like this app called receipt bank, which is like super weird, but I found out                   |
| 16:59      | I could link it to [[Dropbox]].                                                                             |
| 17:00      | So it will watch a [[Dropbox]] folder and pull the receipts in.                                             |
| 17:04      | So I have like, uh, just an action that uploads to a specific folder, right?                            |
| 17:09      | Which was why I, that was the reason why, if you remember again, when shortcuts 1.0 launched            |
| 17:14      | and it didn't have that action, I was so upset because it was saving me so much time rather             |
| 17:20      | than because, because of the way this thing integrates, you have to go to like [[Dropbox]]                  |
| 17:24      | apps, receipt bank, receipts, and I really didn't want to have to do that every time.                   |
| 17:29      | So I do, I, this is a shortcut that I run very frequently.                                              |
| 17:33      | Um, whenever I get an email receipt, I use Spark.                                                       |
| 17:37      | And so I just turn it into a PDF Spark has the ability to do that natively.                             |
| 17:41      | And then I just share it with the, you know, I just use a share extension and pop it in                 |
| 17:46      | [[Dropbox]] using the, that from shortcuts.                                                                 |
| 17:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:49      | I have a bunch of shortcuts exactly like this.                                                          |
| 17:51      | They saved it basically just specific folders in [[Dropbox]] for me.                                        |
| 17:55      | It's wonderful.                                                                                         |
| 17:56      | Wonderful.                                                                                              |
| 17:57      | And then in those dark days, I had a [[Hazel]] rule on the back end on my Mac that would                    |
| 18:01      | look at the file and then move it to the appropriate folder.                                            |
| 18:04      | That was what I thought my kind of future was going to be, right?                                       |
| 18:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 18:09      | Because I was always planning on getting a Mac mini to have for these types of things                   |
| 18:13      | anyway.                                                                                                 |
| 18:14      | And I was like, well, when I get the Mac mini, I'll just have [[Hazel]] watch the folder and                |
| 18:17      | do the manual moving.                                                                                   |
| 18:19      | But it was, it just felt like it wasn't fair.                                                           |
| 18:21      | It's like, yeah, okay, I can do that.                                                                   |
| 18:23      | You know, so I'm very pleased that that was something that they added back because that's               |
| 18:27      | a great action.                                                                                         |
| 18:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 18:29      | We were waiting for quite some time on, on that one.                                                    |
| 18:31      | Everyone was, I was getting really worried that [[Dropbox]] wasn't going to come back and                   |
| 18:35      | thank God it did.                                                                                       |
| 18:37      | As somebody who was narrating [[Federico Viticci\|Federico Viticci's]] audiobook, that came very late.                         |
| 18:44      | That actual edition, I think was in the very final beta like a few days before it came                  |
| 18:48      | out.                                                                                                    |
| 18:49      | So we had to, he had to rewrite a bunch of his review and I had to re-narrate a bunch                   |
| 18:52      | of the review to include, because he was very upset about it as you can imagine.                        |
| 18:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 18:57      | But then it was all fixed.                                                                              |
| 18:58      | So we could take it out again.                                                                          |
| 18:59      | I was at a conference a few years ago and there were several [[Dropbox]] developers there                   |
| 19:05      | and then we got to know each other and, and I learned that they're actually quite conservative          |
| 19:10      | about jumping into Apple system technologies.                                                           |
| 19:14      | They're nervous about that over there and I'm sure that, that was really a question                     |
| 19:18      | for a while at [[Dropbox]], whether or not they were going to buy into Siri shortcuts or not.               |
| 19:22      | And I'm glad they made the right decision at the end.                                                   |
| 19:24      | But I actually not sure whether that came, I think that this came from Apple.                           |
| 19:29      | It wasn't shortcuts.                                                                                    |
| 19:30      | Cause this was, it was a native action that they had because it's not a [[Dropbox]] action.                 |
| 19:36      | It's just a write to a specific folder action.                                                          |
| 19:39      | So it integrates with files.                                                                            |
| 19:40      | Well, it's actually through the [[Dropbox]] API, if I remember correctly.                                   |
| 19:44      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 19:45      | I see.                                                                                                  |
| 19:46      | But then it's still Apple's call though, right?                                                         |
| 19:47      | It's Apple's call, but [[Dropbox]] has to approve them accessing the API, because yeah, like                |
| 19:54      | they don't just let everybody automatically have full access to the API of the folders                  |
| 20:00      | of anybody that's potentially logged in on the device.                                                  |
| 20:02      | I can't remember precisely how the authentication flow goes.                                            |
| 20:05      | I think it pushes you to the [[Dropbox]] application.                                                       |
| 20:08      | If you have it installed, if not, it does it in [[Safari]].                                                 |
| 20:10      | So you do have to be logged in.                                                                         |
| 20:11      | This is the save file action and the only two options you get are iCloud drive or [[Dropbox]].              |
| 20:17      | There'll be only two options, actions that are available.                                               |
| 20:20      | You used to have box in there when it was workflow, but that disappeared when it became                 |
| 20:24      | shortcuts, unfortunately.                                                                               |
| 20:25      | For a while I was writing workflow and shortcuts side by side just for the [[Dropbox]] stuff that           |
| 20:30      | I didn't want to migrate.                                                                               |
| 20:31      | I'd like to wind back a minute to the today view discussion.                                            |
| 20:34      | I think that this is something that a lot of people are starting to encounter as they                   |
| 20:38      | get better at using Siri shortcuts, they start making more of them.                                     |
| 20:42      | It is a pain in the neck to load the app and there's no folders.                                        |
| 20:45      | I mean, obviously that's got to be on a whiteboard at Apple somewhere to make that better.              |
| 20:51      | But I've solved the problem the same way largely Myke has and I've put everything in the today          |
| 20:56      | view widgets and I have these meta shortcuts now that are nothing but launchers for other               |
| 21:02      | shortcuts and like some of them, like I've been playing with toggle and there's literally               |
| 21:07      | shortcut launchers launching shortcut launchers launching shortcut launchers because you break          |
| 21:13      | it into categories like if you if I've got a whole set of categories based on legal work                |
| 21:19      | I've got, you know, you tap on then that opens up those timers and I but I've categorised               |
| 21:26      | it pretty well.                                                                                         |
| 21:27      | Like for instance, I have a photos button, you just a little camera [[Siri]] shortcut that                  |
| 21:32      | launches all of the photo related shortcuts I've made the one that resizes an image for                 |
| 21:37      | posting to the talk dot automators forum or the one that gets me into Instagram.                        |
| 21:45      | All that stuff is just under one button and I've got it down now to about 10 icons in                   |
| 21:51      | the today view that gets me into the whole world of Siri shortcuts and that's been the                  |
| 21:56      | best solution for me so far.                                                                            |
| 21:59      | Also, it's super fast that it was funny like this was something that I had a conversation               |
| 22:06      | with some of the people at workflow when it was still workflow and kind of mentioned this               |
| 22:11      | and they they thought it was kind of funny at the time because if you remember the way                  |
| 22:16      | that you can launch actions and shortcuts it didn't exist in workflow you had to go in                  |
| 22:20      | and press a button right like it wouldn't launch from that main screen and I was like                   |
| 22:24      | oh you should always I said I was launching from the today widget because it's way faster               |
| 22:28      | that way and they were like really I was like yeah because you don't have to watch your                 |
| 22:31      | animations because you used to watch the animations go through as it would go through the workflow      |
| 22:37      | but when it was in the the widget there's no animations to watch so it always performed                 |
| 22:42      | faster so that was why I ended up getting into the habit of using it.                                   |
| 22:45      | Even like you know Grey's method of putting all those shortcuts on his home screen that                 |
| 22:52      | is a little slower because that's actually that can in some cases be a lot slower because               |
| 22:58      | it shoves you to [[Safari]], [[Safari]] sends you over to shortcuts and then you get to watch the whole         |
| 23:03      | animation so for the few that I do have on my home screen still I actually have they are shell          |
| 23:11      | shortcuts that just say that just run another shortcut and the animation is turned off because          |
| 23:15      | you can turn on or off the show when running and if you turn it on then it will push you into the       |
| 23:21      | new shortcut into the shortcut that you're running inside of the shortcut this is getting very nested   |
| 23:27      | but if you turn that off you don't see that and then it does run faster it's not brilliantly            |
| 23:33      | fast but it's better so just to clarify you're making a separate shortcut that's a launcher             |
| 23:37      | for the shortcut you want on your home screen and just and just turn off show and run yeah just to      |
| 23:44      | speed it up because like a lot of mine it's got repeat loops and they're quite long so it scrolls       |
| 23:48      | down the repeat loop and especially if it's doing an API call that can take a few seconds and then      |
| 23:53      | it pings back up to the top of it and if you're watching it after a while you might start to get        |
| 23:57      | seasick just because it's sending you up and down up and down up and down and then eventually you       |
| 24:01      | go down to the bottom that is actually an an excellent tip because what you're doing is forcing         |
| 24:07      | it to run without watching the animations right yeah which will which will which will speed it up       |
| 24:12      | yeah that's a good tip yeah I spent a couple of hours one day like tinkering around with the            |
| 24:19      | kind of the the shortcut home screen idea right like I was thinking like oh what would it be like       |
| 24:25      | you know you guys got your episode about this too like to think of my phone as an action-based          |
| 24:31      | thing rather than an app-based thing and it's still an idea that that I like but it's too slow          |
| 24:38      | and clunky yeah a lot of places because android does this way better so the a lot of actions that       |
| 24:44      | you have in android can just be exposed so for example you know how we can use the 3d touch and         |
| 24:50      | it brings up the options right yeah so like you get make so like let's use to do this as an example     |
| 24:55      | like you could 3d touch on to do this and you get oh you can add a new task right but when you          |
| 25:00      | tap that it opens the app then opens the task field and lets you type in now on android it has          |
| 25:06      | these things to where you long press but you're able to drag these actions out of that menu and         |
| 25:12      | put them on your home screen and with to do this one when you tap it it doesn't open the app it just    |
| 25:18      | opens a small UI right in front of you and you can just end the keyboard pops up and you can just       |
| 25:23      | add a task and I like that a lot more I'm hoping that what we're gonna get like next year is the        |
| 25:29      | ability to take certain actions from shortcuts and put them on our home screen or an out to day         |
| 25:36      | widget so things like adding a new action to to do is and right like you can put in like ask when       |
| 25:42      | run in certain fields and then pre-fill other ones and the pre-filled ones will just be hidden for      |
| 25:46      | you so that you don't need to see them and then hopefully also developers will get the ability          |
| 25:51      | to add to these because of course at the moment it's the ones that developers can donate are purely     |
| 25:57      | they're they're not interactive if they need to be interactive they have to launch the application      |
| 26:01      | right so yeah yeah I hope we'll see something like that soon because yeah as you said like              |
| 26:07      | android is definitely winning over iOS in that respect and I still think the idea of action             |
| 26:12      | based icons is a great idea and I'm still running some even despite you know some of the frustrations   |
| 26:19      | that way and also that's the reason why I find myself on my today's screen so much more often now       |
| 26:25      | part of me almost would like to have the phone launched to the today's screen                           |
| 26:29      | because of these automators um I'm sorry a couple of automators because of these [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]       |
| 26:35      | that I use so often well I think a lot of people would like the ability to launch the today's screen    |
| 26:41      | or to merge the today's screen with their home screen and I'm sure we're going to get something         |
| 26:44      | at some point where it's going to be easier in the meantime I'm using launcher quite a bit to get       |
| 26:50      | certain apps to appear with shortcuts in certain locations and stuff like that or at certain times      |
| 26:55      | of the day so like when I'm outside of Austria then it shows like my general travel widget which        |
| 27:01      | has certain apps and certain shortcuts that I use um which is very similar to your technique both of    |
| 27:06      | you uh where you use the the shortcuts widget a lot yeah and so we're using things like launcher and    |
| 27:15      | you know launch centre pro to kind of hack around the limitations in [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                   |
| 27:21      | but ultimately this is a problem needs to get solved inside [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                            |

| 29:02      | this show and all of Relay FM so mike uh let's uh let's talk about some more of your your favourite      |
| 29:10      | shortcuts all right so I have one called yoga time which is very simple okay uh I don't wear an         |
| 29:18      | apple watch uh so I can't track my exercise using the apple watch but shortcuts has some                |
| 29:25      | actions built right in for uh the health app so when I hit the yoga time it puts my phone on do         |
| 29:33      | not disturb for 30 minutes and sets a 30 minute manual workout into the health app um and I haven't     |
| 29:41      | done this yet but I'm I also like to do my I also like to do yoga at home and I like to do about        |
| 29:48      | but just a little light like not a lot of light so I'm gonna add a home kit action um to just to        |
| 29:54      | set the lights to low when when I'm doing that I just haven't added that in yet because I only          |
| 29:58      | thought of that yesterday okay but that's just a nice little simple one that I that I use yeah          |
| 30:02      | but that's great and I mean if you had the right yoga application theoretically you could even          |
| 30:07      | start the workout but I'm guessing you probably want to use something like an iPad so you can           |
| 30:11      | actually see what you're supposed to be doing that's exactly it I i I did have that in there at one     |
| 30:17      | point that it would then just open my yoga app because you can just have shortcuts open any app         |
| 30:21      | right yeah but I don't I tend to set the the the shortcut on my phone because I want my phone on        |
| 30:28      | do not disturb right during that period of time so then it's not the right place for the for the app    |
| 30:34      | to be opened I haven't checked can you write the health data on the iPad as well or do you have to      |
| 30:39      | do that on the phone too that's phone only it yeah it's fun yeah health is not available on the iPad    |
| 30:45      | yeah so yeah which is something that frustrates me no end because at the very least like allow me to    |
| 30:50      | read the data that's in there out yes it doesn't make any sense because it's like it's between two      |
| 30:55      | iPhones why can't you just let me have it on the iPad exactly though if this is the reason that I       |
| 30:59      | actually started this work this shortcut because the app that I use which is called uh it's called      |
| 31:07      | daily yoga it has a apple health integration but it doesn't work on the iPad yeah right so it it can    |
| 31:14      | write the health data but only if you use it on the iPhone so that was when I was like I wonder         |
| 31:19      | if shortcuts has the ability to add that and as has been since shortcuts existed typically the          |
| 31:26      | answer is yes now I'm supposed to know um and yeah there's health actions in there so I can even uh     |
| 31:32      | even let's me choose that it's yoga like it it writes specifically a yoga workout to the health app     |
| 31:39      | for me which I like so so you've got uh phone I do not disturb write the health data you're             |
| 31:45      | going to add lower the lights to that yes what are you using are you using light bulbs or switches      |
| 31:50      | or how are you doing that I use hue bulbs I have hue bulbs yeah it's a nice it's a nice work but you    |
| 31:56      | know once again the stumbling point I think all of us the obvious stumbling point is you would like     |
| 32:02      | not to have to throw the switch right I mean that once you load the yoga app to have it go through      |
| 32:09      | and you know app based trigger and just go and do those things for you mm-hmm yeah this would be        |
| 32:15      | be yeah I mean of course you have the the slight difficulty in that you would uh open the yoga app      |
| 32:20      | on your iPad but I mean if they just make the health data available on the iPad I mean it's             |
| 32:25      | there anyway it's it must be like available to the iPad it's not necessarily saved on their             |
| 32:30      | storage space concerns you know I'm sure that that is something that the the shortcuts team             |
| 32:35      | probably want to solve and it's just a question of finding the right way to do that because the         |
| 32:40      | I the iPad is obviously missing certain features that health uses like the pedometer automatic          |
| 32:47      | activity tracking and stuff like that I'm sure we'll get there that's one of my nerdy requests          |
| 32:52      | for iOS 13 is that health data on on all of iOS and also time data you know all the time tracking       |
| 32:59      | stuff is doing an app tracking I'd love to see what app developers could do with that if they made      |
| 33:04      | that available and put it on the Mac 2 please that the screen time i I want to know like where my       |
| 33:10      | time is going on all my devices including my max not just my iPad's and iPhone's I waste way more        |
| 33:15      | time on the Mac than I do it everywhere else how do you need to get timing installed yeah well I mean   |
| 33:22      | yeah it's it's just a case of like if it was all in one place that would be perfect you got any         |
| 33:27      | more ones Myke that help you out and as you get through the day I have a super boring one but            |
| 33:33      | I'll share it with you anyway I work in advertising right like I sell ads it's like a big thing that    |
| 33:40      | I do with my company Relay FM of which the show is a part of which we're very happy with and            |
| 33:47      | very proud to have this show as a part of Relay FM but I have to work out what's called CPMs a lot      |
| 33:53      | which is a cost per thousand so we will give to advertisers or this is how much it will cost you        |
| 33:59      | per 1000 listeners or whatever so I have a CPM calculator shortcut which I can use in the widget        |
| 34:09      | and it just gives me a calculator so when I press it it's like how many listeners does an episode       |
| 34:16      | have so I'll type that in and then it's like what is the cost of the ad that you're charging            |
| 34:21      | and then it will tell me what the CPM is based upon those two figures so it's like I you know I         |
| 34:26      | looked up the exact way that you calculate it because sometimes I would get it round the wrong          |
| 34:30      | way and then I just spent some time I put it in uh to shortcuts and now I can just type out this        |
| 34:36      | little calculator thing whenever I want this it's one of the one of the uh I think it's like a          |
| 34:40      | a little tricky thing that's actually in uh the shortcuts out which I love is that if you do use        |
| 34:45      | the um ask for input and like with the calculate actions it just formats a little calculator in         |
| 34:51      | the in the today widget yeah which is really cute you have to ask for input and specify that it's       |
| 34:56      | numbers because the keyboard requires the f to be open but this is something that I'm I mean you        |
| 35:01      | say it's boring I am betting loads of our listeners have certain things that they need to calculate     |
| 35:06      | on a fairly frequent basis but not frequent enough that they can just do it off the top of              |
| 35:11      | their head and that is a great example and it's it was great is that you can if you have a this         |
| 35:17      | was it right like I had I had some common uh calculations that I needed to do and because               |
| 35:23      | of the way that shortcuts works you can do a lot of the like actual calculation part you                |
| 35:28      | just need to give it the input so I just give it the numbers and it does the calculations and I         |
| 35:33      | don't need to remember the formula yeah um but yeah as ro says you've got to say like input type is     |
| 35:40      | number um and when you're asking for input and then you can just type it right in which is I            |
| 35:44      | think is super cool I had a bunch of stuff I used to do through numbers spreadsheets like this you      |
| 35:50      | know for the legal side of my life like calculating dates calculating interest on principle and things  |
| 35:56      | like that and I've turned all of those into [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] over the years for the same reason         |
| 36:00      | because it's it's just at that point it's just a robot that you just give the data to it asks you       |
| 36:05      | in plain English what the data is and it spits out an answer and it's always available and let me       |
| 36:12      | tell you my uh my my the one that I'm most happy with but is the one that is hardest for me to explain  |
| 36:20      | so I have a bunch of shows that I do and I'd like to do preparation for those shows right               |
| 36:26      | all good podcasts have good preparation and so I have like a couple of things that's going on so        |
| 36:32      | pretty much every day I'm doing some kind of prep for some show yeah so I and then there's two things   |
| 36:37      | that's going on here I want to be able to quickly access the documents wherever they are wherever       |
| 36:42      | they're google docs or sometimes apple notes and I also want to be able to set my toggle timers         |
| 36:48      | for time tracking sure so I have a an action that it starts with a menu and it asks me which show       |
| 36:55      | and it has all of my shows listed um and I tap the show and then what will happen is uh it goes         |
| 37:02      | it's like a it goes to each show and it takes the name this is kind of this is kind of complicated      |
| 37:07      | so I have a text box that takes the name of the show then it triggers a toggle timer workflow           |
| 37:15      | where it's it basically it's pasting in the name of the show and that's how it adds which               |
| 37:22      | tag I'm using into toggle that makes sense and then it goes back into shortcuts although I              |
| 37:29      | never see this because again I'm running it from the today widget and then opens the google doc         |
| 37:34      | that I need so I really like that one yeah so uh just to be clear then your your podcast                |
| 37:41      | project in toggle is probably just podcasting right and then you don't break it down into               |
| 37:45      | like one project for each show I gave it the number so yeah well i I do like so it's like               |
| 37:51      | show prep is the project okay and then all of my shows are tags yeah and the description of that        |
| 37:57      | is then the name of the podcast which makes perfect sense to somebody with as many podcasts as you've   |
| 38:01      | got yeah I do it the other way around doing prep for like seven or whatever but yeah that's how I       |
| 38:06      | I've run my toggle slightly inverse to most people that I know in that way so I have like               |
| 38:12      | I have the projects are say for example show editing show prep show recording and then the tags         |
| 38:21      | and the names of each show okay but that's good because especially with so many podcasts then           |
| 38:26      | you probably have uh you know like uh you spend probably I'm guessing a significant amount of           |
| 38:31      | time recording and editing the shows and probably a little less time on the prep um not to say that     |
| 38:36      | you slack off on the prep you clearly don't but um yeah so but then you know you can see how much       |
| 38:41      | time you're spending so if you need to get more time it's really obvious that all of your time          |
| 38:46      | is probably sunk into editing I'm guessing from listening to cortex that cortex is uh one of            |
| 38:51      | those big time sucks and then you can see about ways to reduce that that's related to the last          |
| 38:56      | episode as this one relates to is actually time tracking so for anybody that missed that one            |
| 39:01      | go back and listen to automated time tracking yeah I just think uh anybody that's playing with          |
| 39:05      | things like toggle if you do not use in [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] you're just doing yourself a disservice        |
| 39:10      | because yep it um it simplifies the process of that time tracking you know the problem with any         |
| 39:17      | time tracking where you have to throw switches that were humans and we forget to throw switches and um  |
| 39:23      | you know automator I'm sorry series shortcut type automation can really solve that problem for you      |
| 39:29      | i I talked in the last show about how I have it like if I want to go into OmniFocus and sort out       |
| 39:35      | things I have a timer for planning and it runs that or you know no matter what you're doing the         |
| 39:40      | context of it you can not only kick off the action but you can kick off the timer with that would you   |
| 39:46      | be willing to share some version of that with us so we can show the listeners how you're pulling that   |
| 39:51      | off I'll try yeah I don't know how useful it will be at the very least maybe we can do like a           |
| 39:57      | sanitise screenshot just to show people the example of what the menu entries for example that might     |
| 40:01      | yeah that might be yeah that might be because the thing is it will be very empty because it's           |
| 40:06      | yeah but we I'm sure we can find a way to make it work I mean the the biggest problem with sharing      |
| 40:10      | this is of course um the toggle shortcuts um themselves are going to be unique to every                 |
| 40:15      | listener you're not going to have the same projects as me or my core David so if we share               |
| 40:19      | the shortcut with you it will be broken uh so I think the best thing that we can do is uh do            |
| 40:23      | a little screenshot in the show notes so that we can show you how one of these looks so that you        |
| 40:28      | can put it together yourself yeah I all of my toggle uh workflows shortcuts are just built on           |
| 40:36      | [[Federico Viticci\|Federico's]] work so um he he's he did all of that work so I didn't have to and then the other problem    |
| 40:43      | is the three of us are on the beta for this Timery app which may be out by the time this              |
| 40:48      | app by the time this podcast ships but the uh you know the it it basically it greatly simplifies        |
| 40:55      | the process it takes what used to be a web API call to a one step um series shortcut call and           |
| 41:02      | it's very easy now so in my shortcuts I am still using the web stuff just because I had the more        |
| 41:08      | made beforehand yeah um but i I use Timery for basically setting every single time I accept             |
| 41:16      | my show preparation timers because just because I like having the extra step of having the specific     |
| 41:21      | google doc open so I just haven't changed anything with that yeah well I mean if it's not broken then   |
| 41:26      | there's no reason to fix it is there exactly well you say that it's still broken but I like to try      |
| 41:32      | and find ways to improve it because I can't leave it alone as soon as I get time reinstalled in the     |
| 41:37      | beta I literally I rub everything out yes I threw all that web stuff overboard man because it is so     |
| 41:43      | much faster having a native app just do it for you well put it this way that saved me about             |
| 41:48      | 50 shortcuts when we got the the both the toggle shortcuts and the and then this beta app Timery        |
| 41:55      | as it is currently known I hope it doesn't change names again um I quite like the name but yeah that    |
| 42:00      | that's got rid of a lot of shortcuts for me which is great and you can also just donate those directly  |
| 42:05      | to Siri so you can talk to your HomePod and be like hello HomePod can you turn on this timer for      |
| 42:11      | me and your HomePod will go mm-hmm yes I wanted to ask you both do you do that a lot do you ask        |
| 42:16      | your HomePod to start workflows I know that you mentioned it actually Rose you uh you                 |
| 42:21      | you guessed it on upgrade so I know that you do actually I just remember but Dave do you do that        |
| 42:26      | do you ask your HomePod to start shortcuts for you I've been that's one of the most disappointing      |
| 42:31      | features for me of Siri shortcuts yeah it doesn't look very well yeah and it's a real shame because     |
| 42:39      | then I'm I never do it because the times when I do do it I feel like I'm having to ask stuff over       |
| 42:44      | and over and over again just yesterday I tried again with a simple one you know um and it's a um        |
| 42:52      | you know when I take a shower I have a timer called hygiene you know I said mm-hmm and the and the      |
| 42:58      | command is track hygiene I mean i I don't think and it was looking for a restaurant called hygiene      |
| 43:05      | on my HomePod and I just you know it's like come on man it's like it works fine on the phone like      |
| 43:12      | when I when I trigger Siri on the phone and and say those two words it works every time but for         |
| 43:18      | some reason I feel like there's a lot of work that needs to be done on that HomePod integration        |
| 43:23      | because it's you know that was one of the big promises at w w c and I feel like it still has            |
| 43:27      | not delivered yeah the one where I always have travel is the when I do the I'm home routine             |
| 43:34      | because I've just got home from work and I wanted to stop my my commuting timer I wanted to turn on     |
| 43:39      | the lights um and I wanted to um usually remind me to do something i I do use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] for just a      |
| 43:46      | few things just to have it like tell me and uh it doesn't work then because it hasn't my iPhone         |
| 43:52      | hasn't yet connected to the wi-fi or the HomePod hasn't yet recognised that the iPhone is              |
| 43:57      | on the wi-fi and that one's frustrating um so I usually trigger that on my apple watch now which        |
| 44:04      | is working quite nicely I have to say yeah that's something that could get better yeah definitely       |
| 44:11      | but mike you don't just do [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] you also have gone down the rabbit hole of web              |
| 44:17      | automation mm-hmm yeah I use I use Zapier most pretty much entirely for my web automation now             |
| 44:24      | uh I had some stuff in IFTTTtt but moved it to Zapier because it had some additional functions so one      |
| 44:33      | of my biggest ones is um we started on upgrade doing this and then I do it on a bunch of my             |
| 44:40      | other shows as well is having people as tweet to us questions um so for you know you can send           |
| 44:48      | out a tweet for example with the hashtag ask upgrade and it goes into a spreadsheet that                |
| 44:54      | I've created automatically without me needing to do anything so then when we're when preparing for      |
| 44:59      | upgrade I can just look at the spreadsheet and all the tweets are in there so it's doing a couple       |
| 45:04      | of things that I like it's pulling the information that I want so it's just getting the the name of     |
| 45:08      | the tweet uh it's getting you know date and time so they can be easily sorted and also removed right    |
| 45:14      | when stuff's super old so I can just take a bunch but yeah it's getting the the tweet and the url in    |
| 45:19      | case I want to click through but the thing that frustrated me about um IFTTTtt at least at the            |
| 45:25      | time when I was building this and before I moved it to Zapier the only name field it would get was       |
| 45:30      | the twitter username and I didn't want that I wanted the person's name and so I would have to           |
| 45:37      | spend time every single episode clicking the URLs to get the name of the person but IFTTTtt               |
| 45:45      | sorry but Zapier has the ability to grab the name field from the twitter API so that was one of the      |
| 45:53      | main reasons I moved it away uh there so it can it grabs the person's name and their tweet which is     |
| 45:59      | super good because then I can just copy that straight out of the spreadsheet uh and google              |
| 46:03      | sheets and just drop it into my google doc and it's all ready to go so that that's one of the           |
| 46:08      | biggest things that I have like six or seven of these uh going on um so that's that like that's         |
| 46:15      | just doing stuff for me all the time which I really love so a big fan of that yeah once you             |
| 46:20      | decide to invest in Zapier you will find uses for it because oh yeah it's just so much more powerful     |
| 46:27      | than IFTTTtt it took me years we did a show on Zapier a few months ago and I've been a happy               |
| 46:32      | subscriber since in my zapier list has grown because now it's just something it's a tool in             |
| 46:38      | my tool belt now and often if I do anything involves the web I find that there's a way to               |
| 46:43      | connect something yeah I mean like you know you talk about uh I mentioned it earlier right where        |
| 46:48      | it's like oh if you think shortcuts can do it it probably can the answer for Zapier is like yeah always  |
| 46:55      | there's very very few things it can't yeah exactly like I had a thing where so we use uh fresh          |
| 47:03      | books for our invoicing and we use slack right so these are like two tools that I have and I would      |
| 47:09      | love it and would have loved it if I could have got uh very specific actions in fresh books to show     |
| 47:16      | up in slack I was able to build that was Zapier because they both have APIs so like I built a            |
| 47:21      | slack bot which is super easy to do like if you just build a simple one um and all slack has really     |
| 47:27      | great documentation for this and then it watches an rss feed that fresh books provides and then         |
| 47:33      | just plugs it into slack they may well have a like an official integration now but I did this           |
| 47:37      | like a long time ago and I use another really boring business tool called pipe drive which is a         |
| 47:43      | like a sales management application so like as we're working a deal through sales like for a            |
| 47:48      | sale from like initial contact to interest to contract sent and stuff like that and again               |
| 47:53      | I built an integration with pipe drive and with slack and with Trello because these are like            |
| 48:00      | different tools that we use for different stuff so that when a deal is done it pops up in both          |
| 48:05      | places and so like i I really like the way that Zapier makes it super easy to tie services together      |
| 48:13      | that don't necessarily officially integrate it's really cool and at this point for me Zapier has         |
| 48:18      | become a gating issue for any web service I'm considering like I on the legal side I'm using            |
| 48:24      | a combination of the billing web service and the air table when I set up a new client but then I        |
| 48:30      | thought well why don't I have a web service send the engagement letter to them with you know all        |
| 48:36      | the details and that you know it's a it's basically a fill-in form which I've been doing in pages for   |
| 48:41      | years with a [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcut but I thought well what what if I automate this on the           |
| 48:45      | web so of course I went to Zapier and got a list of all the web-based document generation apps that      |
| 48:52      | that integrate with him and now I'm going through them all to figure out if one of them is going        |
| 48:56      | to be acceptable to me because I like the idea of just automating it through but but I have to go       |
| 49:02      | to Zapier now at any web service I'm considering because if they don't have Zapier support then           |
| 49:07      | they're dead to me you know I can't use them it's not worth the investment right yeah you set           |
| 49:11      | engagement and that that made me smile because it made me remember something when I got married         |
| 49:18      | middle of last year and we had a website set up it was a square space website where                     |
| 49:26      | people would enter in their information into a form and it would go into google sheets right so         |
| 49:31      | this was like RSVP's they put people with RSVP through the website choose their like menu options       |
| 49:37      | through the website and stuff like that and I set up a Zapier action with google sheets and the app      |
| 49:43      | push over which is an ios app that can give you push notifications from like the app like the           |
| 49:51      | web service being pinged right so like it would look for something so every time somebody filled in     |
| 49:56      | the RSVP I would get a push notification to know that they've done it like because it was monitoring    |
| 50:02      | the google sheet for changes but and it was super cool because with the way that Zapier worked I could   |
| 50:07      | actually have the notification give me the name of the person because I could just watch these          |
| 50:11      | specific cell or this specific column yeah and yeah it was really awesome that that was really          |
| 50:16      | great that was like one of those things I was like yeah I was really proud of myself have you           |
| 50:20      | discovered the joy that is air table yet mike I played around of air table a while ago and for          |
| 50:26      | some reason bounced off it yeah I think we're going to do a show on air table I'm I would I would like  |
| 50:32      | to hear hear it actually I want to know what you're using air table for so it is over it is okay        |
| 50:40      | that sounds good I mean I like the sound of that I'm on their website right now and it looks nice       |
| 50:45      | it looks like it's everything like Trello and a calendar it can be everything at some of the            |
| 50:50      | views unfortunately are not available on ios so for example you can have so for people who aren't       |
| 50:57      | familiar with air table let's start the beginning it's a database service which there's a free tier     |
| 51:03      | those are premium tier a pro tier and a business tier I want to say enterprise tier is the final        |
| 51:09      | one that's that's the final one I know but essentially it's a database with really nice views           |
| 51:16      | built into it so if you have a date column then you can have a calendar view of everything that has     |
| 51:21      | a date so for example I'm using this with [[Tim Stringer]] Learn OmniFocus we have like the stuff          |
| 51:28      | that I'm producing for him and I just have a calendar view that also has an iCal subscription so         |
| 51:33      | I can have that in my calendar which means that also I can subscribe to that in say google calendar     |
| 51:39      | and when a new event appears on that I can have it mail drop to OmniFocus with tasks to complete       |
| 51:45      | and oh my gosh it's so much fun yeah so uh air table's good we'll we'll do an episode on it's coming    |
| 51:52      | yeah the uh mike when's the last time you did something with your automation that just delighted        |
| 51:57      | you you know i I know that you're nerd like the rest of us it sometimes it just makes you smile         |
| 52:02      | when this automation stuff works right yes let me think I mean I thought that all the wedding           |
| 52:09      | stuff was really good right because I felt like I oh I know so I record a show called the pan addict    |
| 52:16      | which is a podcast about pens believe it or not and my co-host brad has a very very very bad internet   |
| 52:23      | connection very bad yeah takes him a very long time to upload his files because he lives out in         |
| 52:29      | the sticks in Atlanta and I would find myself like having to keep periodically checking to see          |
| 52:36      | when it was uploaded we use google drive because it's just the easiest thing for him to upload          |
| 52:42      | and it was very frustrating to me and then I was like remember that I'd signed up for                   |
| 52:50      | the what's the push notification app that I was just talking about push over there you go I remember    |
| 52:55      | that I'd signed up for push over and I thought interesting so I went into Zapier and I created           |
| 53:02      | a zap which monitors our google folder and then when there's any change to it I get a push notification |
| 53:08      | so I no longer have to be waiting around for brad's file because my phone just tells me when it's       |
| 53:13      | there and it was just this is this is my favourite things about automation in general it of course       |
| 53:19      | I'm preaching to the choir here is how it can just take those little frustrations away or like          |
| 53:24      | another one I have a Roomba right yeah and I like my HomePod and you it's possible using IFTTTtt         |
| 53:32      | to get all this stuff to talk together with like webhooks yeah so I can ask my HomePod to start        |
| 53:38      | my Roomba because iRobot the company who make Roomba have an IFTT action but not a shortcut             |
| 53:45      | but I've created a shortcut that will just ping the webhook and just trigger the IFTT action            |
| 53:51      | and we're going to include a post [[Federico Viticci]] over max stories wrote a great                        |
| 53:55      | post about how to do webhooks with IFTTT my Roomba is in that post yeah that's going to say I recorded   |
| 54:03      | a little video for him and mike's Roomba is a starring role in that post I can't remember               |
| 54:09      | does your Roomba also talk in that post or is that just on it no that's just a Relay FM member          |
| 54:15      | special oh okay because I do remember hearing from mike's Roomba at some point and uh if you            |
| 54:20      | are not a Relay FM member and you would like to hear mike's Roomba talking then you you should          |
| 54:25      | sign up and try that out that's a whole lot of great member content you know all this                   |
| 54:29      | Roomba talk is really dangerous to me it sounds like fun but I have basically uh like my studio         |
| 54:36      | is cork and I have wood floors I'm not sure that it really would be worth it well we use we have        |
| 54:41      | wood floors yeah we do you're not helping me man don't get one yet though Dave wait because they        |
| 54:47      | have a new model it's coming out that looks even better because it it will learn your house and         |
| 54:51      | you can ask it to go to certain rooms it's the one thing I wished Roomba did and they have new          |
| 54:56      | models coming out that will do that of course they do don't buy one yet I have the Neato botvac d7       |
| 55:01      | and you can tell it to go clean like the hallway uh and you can even manually drive it if you want      |
| 55:07      | to I have no idea why you would want to manually drive your your Neato I have this stuff sometimes       |
| 55:12      | where like I'm trying to get the Roomba to go home and it won't do it like it just keeps bouncing into  |
| 55:17      | the sofa and like if I could just drive it I could help it like I'm kind of like chasing the thing      |
| 55:21      | around the house trying to get it to go back to the home oh ours never struggles to go home it          |
| 55:25      | got stuck under the toilet yesterday don't ask me how I came home that's when you drive it out right    |
| 55:30      | if you uh I have to try driving it out next time I know for a fact that I couldn't drive it out from    |
| 55:35      | work um but it also sent me a message to say it was like stuck on something and if I could              |
| 55:40      | please help it get free and I came home and it just tried to climb into the toilet help I was           |
| 55:44      | sick I once had a notification from my Roomba that said help I'm on a cliff                             |
| 55:53      | or it's like it was like I'm on a ledge or a cliff and it was just on the rug I don't know              |
| 55:56      | what the problem was but it was very upset is your rug black yes there you go they they struggle with   |
| 56:03      | black rocks oh yeah of course they do because there's no light yeah that makes sense infrared yeah you  |
| 56:10      | know they uh um they have that Brava product which basically pushes around a cloth um yeah it's like    |
| 56:18      | a mopping one right yeah a buffing one we have that it was made by a prior manufacturer years before    |
| 56:24      | and we bought it we've had ours like five years I've replaced the battery in it twice um and it's       |
| 56:29      | great for the wood floors it pushes around and it picks up a lot of stuff but I don't know I just       |
| 56:34      | feel like I need to to up my game at some point maybe I'll put that on my nerd uh my nerd uh toy        |
| 56:40      | list yeah so so mike um what is automation where's automation filling you right now you know if you     |
| 56:47      | were in charge at apple and what would you do to improve the systems that you have                      |
| 56:53      | um i I really do think that these Siri stuff could be better and I know this is like a                  |
| 57:04      | such an often used for like complaint at this point but I was so excited with the idea of               |
| 57:12      | being able to trigger these shortcuts with Siri and it just it just hasn't panned out for me in         |
| 57:17      | the way that I wanted it to right like I just feel like it's not as reliable as I would as I would      |
| 57:23      | have liked it to be um and this is with just Siri on the phone Siri on the HomePod and also just       |
| 57:30      | you know talking about that as well like the way that my HomePod can't do things that my phone         |
| 57:38      | can I really wish that that wasn't the case considering the fact that the HomePod always               |
| 57:43      | tries to take the request yeah and and and it makes it very frustrating um I would also just like to    |
| 57:49      | have you know again stuff that everybody wants right like the ability to run things just automatically  |
| 57:57      | on a timer in the background without my input um the ability to be able to uh have a comp like a        |
| 58:05      | little bit of a conversation with Siri which I have enabled you know so like ask me for this            |
| 58:13      | input and I will give it but like all verbally but let's get the basics with Siri right first           |
| 58:18      | but like these are the types of things that I would that I would ideally like to see um and it's all    |
| 58:23      | shortcuts related for me right yeah you know i I also want to see just more tools I I'm interested      |
| 58:30      | to see what more stuff the shortcuts team would do more than anything I don't want it to stop and       |
| 58:35      | I would love to see shortcuts on the Mac as well because if I ever want to build something I would      |
| 58:40      | like to be able to do that and also I think that they could build a really cool Mac or iPad like        |
| 58:46      | more advanced editing tool um than than what they have right now with shortcuts you know like stuff     |
| 58:52      | to allow you to like copy and paste actions and move things around in big chunks and you know           |
| 58:58      | like stuff like that I would really and I think that would be a great use case for the Mac right        |
| 59:03      | like to be able to let you kind of open it up and play around with it that way kind of more             |
| 59:08      | or mass I suppose yeah I feel like the more they give us with serious shortcuts the more we want        |
| 59:13      | I mean I'm super happy I mean it's hard to believe that in just what has it been out like six months    |
| 59:19      | now um we have nearly you know automation friendly tasks out of nearly every application on our devices |
| 59:28      | but that just opens up all the questions we've been asking throughout the show how do I make it         |
| 59:32      | trigger easier how do I go deeper with this how do I organise these better and these are growing        |
| 59:37      | problems but the um but i I hope they just put the gas down on that and that we get we get farther      |
| 59:43      | with that this year at w w dc yeah definitely me too well Myke thanks so much for coming on              |
| 59:50      | and sharing a few of your automations with us i I you know anybody listening to the show I think      |
| 59:56      | Myke's a great example of someone who hasn't made a career out of automation but yet uses automation     |
| 01:00:02   | every day to help their career and I think that's the goal of this show if you're listening uh          |
| 01:00:07   | where you hit those pain points hopefully we're giving you the tools and the knowledge to to            |
| 01:00:12   | build your own shortcuts or your apple scripts or whatever it is that you need uh to get your work      |
| 01:00:17   | done get home a little earlier and enjoy your life more um we're gonna we're gonna get some of this     |
| 01:00:23   | stuff from Myke or we'll even just build similar versions we'll put out with the show so you can         |

| 01:01:07   | who doesn't listen to any other relay shows and they want a recommendation to get started with I        |

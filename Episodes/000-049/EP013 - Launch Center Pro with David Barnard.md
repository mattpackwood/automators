| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, this is Automators.                                           |
| 00:04      | I'm Rose Orchard and I am here today with my co-host,                |
| 00:07      | David Sparks or Sparky as he'll be known for this episode.           |
| 00:10      | How are you today, David?                                            |
| 00:11      | Yes, using my secret identity today.                                 |
| 00:13      | That's a secret. How are you, Rose?                                  |
| 00:15      | I am very excited for this episode and do you know why?              |
| 00:19      | Why?                                                                 |
| 00:20      | Because this is the episode where we get to dive                     |
| 00:24      | deep on one of the very first automation apps for iOS.               |
| 00:28      | Excellent and we have a guest.                                       |
| 00:31      | We do and so hello, David.                                           |
| 00:34      | David Bernard from [[Contrast]].                                         |
| 00:36      | Excited to be here.                                                  |
| 00:38      | David is the developer of [[Launch Center Pro]],                          |
| 00:42      | which is, as Rose was saying,                                        |
| 00:43      | one of the very first apps that really gave us a path to             |
| 00:48      | be automation-friendly on iOS and iPhone.                            |
| 00:51      | As this show gets released,                                          |
| 00:54      | we just recently released version three of [[Launch Center Pro]].         |
| 00:58      | As we record, it's hopefully barring                                 |
| 01:02      | any unforeseen rejections or                                         |
| 01:05      | other bugs, circumstances, or otherwise.                             |
| 01:08      | It should be released about four days from when we record this show. |
| 01:12      | So I'm a little sleep deprived,                                      |
| 01:15      | but quite excited and ready to get this thing out in the world.      |
| 01:19      | It's funny when this app first came out.                             |
| 01:22      | So [[Launch Center Pro]] is an app that at its most basic level,          |
| 01:27      | it's an app to launch other apps, hence the name.                    |
| 01:30      | But it does so much more.                                            |
| 01:32      | It's got all these ways you can run,                                 |
| 01:34      | like you can run [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                                     |
| 01:35      | you can dial specific contacts or text specific people.              |
| 01:40      | I remember the very first time you guys released this app            |
| 01:44      | and I downloaded it and installed it.                                |
| 01:46      | The very first time you open it,                                     |
| 01:47      | you immediately realise this is like a bag of                        |
| 01:50      | holding for apps and automation on your phone.                       |
| 01:53      | It's a great, great little utility.                                  |
| 01:56      | So I'm really excited that you guys                                  |
| 01:58      | have just released version three and are still making it work.       |
| 02:02      | Yeah. It's been a long road getting to this point.                   |
| 02:06      | Well, actually, we almost released the first version in 2012.        |
| 02:14      | No, sorry, 2011, Christmas of 2011,                                  |
| 02:18      | and it got rejected at the last minute.                              |
| 02:21      | So it ended up being early                                           |
| 02:24      | January and being a different app than we originally intended.       |
| 02:27      | So yeah, we've been at this seven years now.                         |
| 02:31      | That's back in the days when [[Apple]] was                               |
| 02:34      | kind of fiddly about automation.                                     |
| 02:37      | I bet there's a great story in                                       |
| 02:40      | how you got the initial launch through [[Apple]].                        |
| 02:43      | Well, the story is we didn't.                                        |
| 02:47      | So I'll give you kind of the origin story of the app.                |
| 02:53      | The fall of 2011,                                                    |
| 02:58      | I was just looking for new opportunities,                            |
| 03:02      | new projects, new interesting things to work on,                     |
| 03:05      | and I came up with the idea of                                       |
| 03:07      | kind of hacking notification centre,                                 |
| 03:11      | and we did some experiments                                          |
| 03:12      | with persistent notifications showing up in notification centre,     |
| 03:17      | and probably some of your listeners                                  |
| 03:20      | won't even remember this far back.                                   |
| 03:21      | I think what 2011 was like,                                          |
| 03:24      | I was four or five or something.                                     |
| 03:27      | This was a long time ago.                                            |
| 03:29      | I mean, it was just such a different world back then,                |
| 03:32      | and there was no today widgets,                                      |
| 03:36      | there was notification centre,                                       |
| 03:37      | it was like a completely different beast.                            |
| 03:39      | But the idea was by putting                                          |
| 03:42      | notifications into notification centre,                              |
| 03:44      | we could allow quick launching of early on,                          |
| 03:49      | we didn't have all the hundreds of apps                              |
| 03:52      | with complex [[URL Schemes]] we now have today.                          |
| 03:54      | It was like call people and text people                              |
| 03:57      | and the kind of like real basic stuff that,                          |
| 03:59      | I mean, it's still kind of the bread and butter of the app,          |
| 04:00      | but just really basic stuff,                                         |
| 04:03      | and [[Apple]] didn't like the idea of us                                 |
| 04:07      | using notification centre as a launcher.                             |
| 04:10      | They thought that was not a great experience for users,              |
| 04:14      | and so they flat out rejected the app.                               |
| 04:17      | We, of course, were pretty frustrated and dejected                   |
| 04:22      | because we thought it was a really cool hack.                        |
| 04:26      | That's not what notification centre was intended to do,              |
| 04:28      | but it was, I mean, when I say hack,                                 |
| 04:30      | I mean, not in the sense of like we use private APIs                 |
| 04:35      | or did anything, but just a hack in the sense of using it            |
| 04:38      | in a misappropriating it in an interesting way                       |
| 04:42      | that didn't break any technology or anything like that,              |
| 04:45      | but just did something that [[Apple]] didn't intend.                     |
| 04:49      | So-                                                                  |
| 04:50      | Can I just interrupt to say I love the phrase                        |
| 04:51      | misappropriated in an interesting way?                               |
| 04:53      | I just love that.                                                    |
| 04:54      | So we almost did not even put it in the app store                    |
| 05:03      | because we thought that what was particularly interesting            |
| 05:06      | about it was the notification centre aspect,                         |
| 05:10      | but we thought, you know, this is still a useful app.                |
| 05:13      | It's still kind of, you know, interesting                            |
| 05:15      | to create some shortcuts, even if you have to launch the app         |
| 05:18      | and then trigger the shortcuts.                                      |
| 05:19      | And so, you know, we put it out into the world                       |
| 05:22      | and I've got to give a lot of credit to [[Federico Viticci\|Viticci]] here.                 |
| 05:27      | He just went nuts for it and immediately saw the potential.          |
| 05:32      | So this was, and to clarify, this was actually [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]],        |
| 05:37      | pre-[[Launch Center Pro]].                                               |
| 05:39      | Yes.                                                                 |
| 05:40      | So, and it was a completely different app                            |
| 05:43      | from[[Launch Center Pro]].                                              |
| 05:44      | It didn't have tiles.                                                |
| 05:45      | It was just kind of a list.                                          |
| 05:48      | And so anyways, he fell in love,                                     |
| 05:51      | started covering it on [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/)                                   |
| 05:54      | and it started to have a little bit of a groundswell                 |
| 05:56      | of people saying, you know, this is actually pretty handy            |
| 05:59      | creating these shortcuts and having them all in an app.              |
| 06:02      | And so we worked on that for like three or four months               |
| 06:06      | iterating very quickly and adding tons of features                   |
| 06:09      | and started digging into more complex [[URL Schemes]].                   |
| 06:12      | And then other developers started integrating                        |
| 06:16      | more and more [[URL Schemes]] into their apps                            |
| 06:17      | and we started finding more and more.                                |
| 06:19      | And then by that summer, we released a whole new version             |
| 06:24      | of it aunch centre and called it Launch Center pro.                 |
| 06:28      | So that's how we got started.                                        |
| 06:29      | It was not really intended to turn into this big automation          |
| 06:34      | thing that it did, but it was just kind of a interesting way         |
| 06:38      | to misappropriate notification centre.                               |
| 06:42      | Now I wanna ask you about this.                                      |
| 06:44      | How did you find all these [[URL Schemes]]?                              |
| 06:47      | I mean, that's something I've always wondered about                  |
| 06:48      | because you guys were one of the first people                        |
| 06:50      | on the scene to really capitalise                                    |
| 06:53      | on the existence of [[URL Schemes]].                                     |
| 06:56      | And it wasn't like there was a list somewhere, right?                |
| 06:59      | I mean, did you just have to go spelunking                           |
| 07:01      | through all these apps?                                              |
| 07:03      | So combination of things, we have spent literally hundreds           |
| 07:10      | of hours putting together the [[URL Schemes]] we now have,               |
| 07:15      | some of which have been misappropriated by other apps,               |
| 07:19      | competing apps, but we spent hundreds of hours.                      |
| 07:23      | So we would go through apps looking for,                             |
| 07:27      | you can actually download the app to the computer, open it up,       |
| 07:34      | look at a PList file, which lists all the [[URL Schemes]]                |
| 07:37      | for an app.                                                          |
| 07:39      | Now that only gives you the launch URL.                              |
| 07:41      | It doesn't actually give you any actions                             |
| 07:43      | or any other triggers within the app,                                |
| 07:47      | but it's enough to kind of get started.                              |
| 07:48      | And then sometimes we just guess at other things.                    |
| 07:53      | Some apps were starting to document the [[URL Schemes]].                 |
| 07:57      | Marco Arment and Greg,                                               |
| 08:00      | I always forget his last name,                                       |
| 08:01      | Yeah Pearce.                                                      |
| 08:03      | I call him Greg Tortoise.                                             |
| 08:05      | Yeah, agiletortoise, yeah.                                         |
| 08:11      | So they had started, gosh, a year,                                   |
| 08:14      | maybe even a year and a half before us                               |
| 08:16      | with X callback URL.                                                 |
| 08:18      | And so as that had started to grow a little bit,                     |
| 08:21      | some developers were starting to document their [[URL Schemes]].         |
| 08:25      | And so we would ask around and scour the web                         |
| 08:29      | and look at support docs.                                            |
| 08:31      | But then by the time [[Launch Center Pro]] was released,                 |
| 08:34      | it got a ton of press and started to gather a following              |
| 08:38      | to where a lot of developers started submitting                      |
| 08:42      | their [[URL Schemes]] to us directly.                                    |
| 08:46      | And then we have actually collaborated                               |
| 08:48      | with probably 20 or 30 developers                                    |
| 08:52      | to kind of help them understand the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]                       |
| 08:56      | and help define their [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]                                     |
| 08:59      | and help them implement it into their app.                           |
| 09:01      | And then of course,                                                  |
| 09:04      | as helping them design the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]],                               |
| 09:06      | we know how it all works and everything.                             |
| 09:09      | So yeah, it's kind of been a hodgepodge                              |
| 09:11      | over the years of trial and error,                                   |
| 09:12      | looking at [[PLISTs\|PLIST]], talking with developers, helping them.           |
| 09:16      | But yeah, it's definitely been a lot of work                         |
| 09:21      | to cobble all that together.                                         |
| 09:23      | Well, we all appreciate it.                                          |
| 09:25      | And I know that this app is one of the reasons                       |
| 09:29      | why we have so much great automation today                           |
| 09:31      | is I feel like once this app took off,                               |
| 09:34      | people started to take automation seriously on iOS.                  |
| 09:36      | And I don't know that that was really happening                      |
| 09:38      | before [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]].                                                |
| 09:40      | One of the things that I've been using [[Launch Center Pro]] for         |
| 09:42      | for years, and this is not, well,                                    |
| 09:44      | it is actually an automation trick,                                  |
| 09:45      | is I've been using it to build [[URL Schemes]]                           |
| 09:47      | because it seems to me that you guys                                 |
| 09:49      | have got the definitive dictionary.                                  |
| 09:52      | It's like when you open an [[AppleScript]] editor                       |
| 09:54      | on the Mac, [[Script Editor]],                                            |
| 09:55      | and you can find the dictionaries for all the applications.          |
| 09:57      | I see [[Launch Center Pro]] as well as doing many other things           |
| 10:01      | as the dictionary for all of the [[URL Schemes]] on iOS as well.         |
| 10:05      | And it lets me build them,                                           |
| 10:06      | which that's something that I've not found                           |
| 10:08      | in any other application at all,                                     |
| 10:10      | just because you guys have got all of it,                            |
| 10:12      | or at least that's how it feels like to me as a user.                |
| 10:15      | Yeah, and I mean, we certainly don't have                            |
| 10:17      | every [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] that exists on iOS,                                 |
| 10:19      | but we certainly, like you said,                                     |
| 10:20      | have the most and the most handy,                                    |
| 10:24      | because most of the apps that are of interest                        |
| 10:29      | to be automated have been pestered enough by us                      |
| 10:33      | and users over the years to actually add [[URL Schemes]].                |
| 10:36      | So, things like [[OmniFocus]] and [[Things]] and [[Clear]]                       |
| 10:41      | and all the to-do lists and those sorts of apps.                     |
| 10:44      | It's kind of all the apps that fit into this space                   |
| 10:49      | that folks who are into automation                                   |
| 10:52      | might actually use that app.                                         |
| 10:54      | Most of them do have [[URL Schemes]] in,                                 |
| 10:56      | and like I said, quite a few of them                                 |
| 10:59      | we worked with to get them in there.                                 |
| 11:00      | So, yeah, it's quite a dictionary                                    |
| 11:04      | and it has taken a lot to continue                                   |
| 11:06      | to maintain over the years as well.                                  |
| 11:08      | So speaking of kind of the early times in iOS automation             |
| 11:13      | and what's led us to today with [[Shortcuts]]                            |
| 11:16      | and [[Workflow]] before that,                                            |
| 11:18      | back in, and I think it was the fall of 2013,                        |
| 11:22      | Ari, who founded [[Workflow]]                                            |
| 11:24      | and is now at [[Apple]] working on [[Shortcuts]].                            |
| 11:26      | At the time, he was building this app called [[DeskConnect]]            |
| 11:29      | and it would push files and the clipboard                            |
| 11:33      | and other information back and forth from iOS to macOS.              |
| 11:38      | Well, since early in [[Launch Center Pro]],                             |
| 11:42      | that's one of the things we had been considering doing               |
| 11:44      | was how can we extend [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]] onto the desktop                 |
| 11:48      | and we thought it would be really interesting                        |
| 11:50      | to kind of have a universal clipboard between iOS and Mac            |
| 11:54      | and there's just a lot of interesting stuff                          |
| 11:57      | for us in that space.                                                |
| 11:58      | So he reached out to me in the fall                                  |
| 12:00      | and said, hey, we'd love to partner with you on [[DeskConnect]].        |
| 12:04      | Like how could we work together                                      |
| 12:05      | to like integrate [[DeskConnect]] into [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]]                    |
| 12:08      | and are there some stuff we can work on?                             |
| 12:10      | And I said at the time,                                              |
| 12:13      | I said, you know, that's actually a direction                        |
| 12:16      | we might want ahead.                                                 |
| 12:18      | So, yeah, it's probably best if we don't collaborate                 |
| 12:22      | because we may end up competitors soon.                              |
| 12:26      | And turns out, you know, six months later,                           |
| 12:31      | they were actually, I don't know the exact timeline,                 |
| 12:35      | but months later, they started working on [[Workflow]],                  |
| 12:39      | which, you know, of course, in some ways,                            |
| 12:41      | competed with [[Launch Center Pro]].                                     |
| 12:43      | And I was just relating that story to somebody recently              |
| 12:45      | thinking how had we collaborated with them,                          |
| 12:51      | they might not have actually built [[Workflow]].                         |
| 12:54      | And I say that not like we would not have ever built [[Workflow]].       |
| 12:57      | And I've said this in tweets                                         |
| 12:58      | and I think even blogged about it like, you know,                    |
| 13:01      | so I don't actually do any of the coding.                            |
| 13:03      | I do kind of project management, business, support.                  |
| 13:06      | I mean, I just kind of do everything else                            |
| 13:08      | except the coding and design.                                        |
| 13:10      | So Justin Ewing was my business partner at the time.                 |
| 13:16      | And it was just the two of us.                                       |
| 13:17      | And we weren't gonna hire people.                                    |
| 13:19      | We both had families.                                                |
| 13:20      | We weren't working 18 hours a day.                                   |
| 13:24      | You know, we were just doing what we could and,                       |
| 13:25      | building a great app.                                                |
| 13:27      | So we would have never built [[Workflow]].                               |
| 13:29      | Like those guys are incredible programmers, super sharp.             |
| 13:33      | You know, they were living in a coding hostel,                       |
| 13:36      | programming like 24x7 as a whole team.                           |
| 13:41      | So there's no way we would ever built [[Workflow]]                       |
| 13:43      | or been acquired by [[Apple]] or anything like that.                     |
| 13:45      | And so I no way regret this.                                         |
| 13:48      | And I tell the story in a way to say it's kind of fun                |
| 13:51      | that we didn't collaborate with them                                 |
| 13:54      | because if we had, who knows where things would be today.            |
| 13:57      | And so it's kind of cool how that all played together                |
| 14:01      | and how, you know, I've been in touch with Ari since,                |
| 14:05      | you know, like I said, sometime in 2013,                             |
| 14:08      | maybe even fall of 2012.                                             |
| 14:10      | And it's all a bit fuzzy now being five, six years ago.              |
| 14:14      | That's an interesting question though,                               |
| 14:15      | because I think a lot of listeners will wonder, you know,            |
| 14:18      | what is the difference between [[Launch Center Pro]]                     |
| 14:20      | and something like [[Workflow]]?                                         |
| 14:22      | Or now [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] and how do they work together?                 |
| 14:26      | And I'd like to hear your answer to that,                            |
| 14:28      | but my answer would be they really do empower each other             |
| 14:33      | with this new version three.                                         |
| 14:34      | For instance, you can put [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                             |
| 14:37      | into [[Launch Center Pro]].                                              |
| 14:39      | And just to kind of give a peek of how I use the app,                |
| 14:42      | I keep [[Launch Center Pro]] in my dock.                                 |
| 14:45      | And then when I open it up,                                          |
| 14:47      | I've got some of my most key [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                          |
| 14:50      | right there under my thumb.                                          |
| 14:53      | And one of the things I really like,                                 |
| 14:54      | and I'm curious how you guys did this,                               |
| 14:56      | is normally when you launch a Siri shortcut from the desktop,        |
| 14:59      | you get this jiggling where it goes to [[Safari]]                        |
| 15:02      | and then it goes to the [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] app.                          |
| 15:03      | And the whole thing feels pretty,                                    |
| 15:06      | I don't know, feels pretty wonky to me.                              |
| 15:08      | But for some reason, when you launch it out of your app,             |
| 15:11      | it jumps straight to the Siri shortcut,                              |
| 15:13      | which makes it feel more efficient.                                  |
| 15:16      | But anyway, you know, they really do work together.                  |
| 15:20      | Yeah, and that's, you know, when [[Workflow]] came out,                  |
| 15:24      | you know, of course, we were a little bummed.                        |
| 15:26      | I mean, you know, we were kind of the big guy in the space           |
| 15:29      | and almost immediately, you know, [[Workflow]] took some                 |
| 15:34      | of the use cases that we were covering.                              |
| 15:37      | And it was obvious in the app too.                                   |
| 15:39      | I mean, you know, they're really cool guys                           |
| 15:42      | and have always been great to us.                                    |
| 15:43      | So I don't say this at all disparagingly,                            |
| 15:46      | but it's pretty obvious they looked at [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]]                 |
| 15:49      | and said, okay, here are some of the ways                            |
| 15:50      | people are using [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]].                                      |
| 15:51      | Maybe we could do this,                                              |
| 15:53      | but maybe do it even better in [[Workflow]].                             |
| 15:55      | So there were a lot of things in [[Launch Center Pro]]                   |
| 15:58      | at the time that [[Workflow]] all of a sudden did.                       |
| 16:03      | And in quite a few cases, honestly, did better.                      |
| 16:07      | So at that point, you know, we realised that we,                     |
| 16:10      | especially again, just as two guys, only one programmer,             |
| 16:15      | you know, we knew we weren't gonna compete with [[Workflow]]             |
| 16:17      | on being a full automation suite.                                    |
| 16:21      | And so we kind of shifted more towards                               |
| 16:24      | the things that complimented [[Workflow]]                                |
| 16:26      | and continue to this day to focus more                               |
| 16:30      | on those complementary aspects                                       |
| 16:32      | versus being the kind of end-all be-all.                             |
| 16:35      | And at this point with [[Shortcuts]] integrated                          |
| 16:37      | so deep into iOS, like there's no way                                |
| 16:39      | we're gonna compete on a direct automation basis.                    |
| 16:43      | You know, we can't trigger an eye message                            |
| 16:48      | in the background without user confirmation.                         |
| 16:50      | We can't, I mean, there's just, we can't toggle settings.            |
| 16:52      | We can't turn on and off alarms.                                     |
| 16:54      | Like, here's so much amazing stuff                                   |
| 16:56      | that's so deeply integrated into iOS with [[Shortcuts]] now              |
| 16:59      | that we'll just never be able to do.                                 |
| 17:01      | So-                                                                  |
| 17:02      | They're behind the wall, you know,                                   |
| 17:03      | they're part of [[Apple]].                                               |
| 17:04      | Exactly.                                                             |
| 17:05      | Yeah, so it's kind of unfair competition.                            |
| 17:09      | In a cool way though, like I love what [[Shortcuts]] is doing            |
| 17:12      | and I'm so glad [[Apple]] acquired them.                                 |
| 17:14      | And I think like it's better for everybody.                          |
| 17:16      | So we've shifted to focusing on the things                           |
| 17:19      | that really compliment the app                                       |
| 17:20      | and we'll continue kind of working around                            |
| 17:22      | complimenting that as much as we can.                                |
| 17:25      | So I think, you know, there's a lot of things where,                 |
| 17:29      | you know, if you just want to launch [[Instagram]]                       |
| 17:32      | to the camera versus launching it and it's in your feed              |
| 17:35      | and then you gotta switch to the camera or whatever,                 |
| 17:37      | you know, for those kind of short quick things,                      |
| 17:39      | launching are still a great place to go,                             |
| 17:41      | find the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] and set up a shortcut                            |
| 17:44      | and you just get right there.                                        |
| 17:46      | And then like you said, triggering,                        |
| 17:48      | you know, we've integrated in 3.0 a shortcut                         |
| 17:53      | to import shortcuts and it even grabs the shortcut icon              |
| 17:58      | that you created in the [[Shortcuts]] app.                             |
| 18:01      | So triggering [[Shortcuts]] is great.                                    |
| 18:03      | And then for a lot of the more simple things like, you know,         |
| 18:07      | calling my wife, texting her, you know,                              |
| 18:09      | some of the like real basic stuff is still, you know,                |
| 18:14      | so much better and quicker and easier to just do.                    |
| 18:17      | You don't need, it's kind of, you know,                              |
| 18:19      | using a sledgehammer on a nail to trigger a phone call               |
| 18:24      | in shortcuts.                                                        |
| 18:26      | So I feel like there is definitely a lot                             |
| 18:29      | that [[Launch Center Pro]] still excels at.                              |
| 18:33      | And then for now, I mean, I assume at some point,                    |
| 18:35      | shortcuts is gonna, you know, add folders                            |
| 18:37      | and better organisation and things of that nature.                   |
| 18:41      | But for now, you know, we've really focused                          |
| 18:43      | on continuing to be a much more customisable launch experience.      |
| 18:47      | So, you know, once you have 25 or 30 shortcuts                       |
| 18:50      | in the [[Shortcuts]] app, it becomes pretty unwieldy.                    |
| 18:54      | And in the long run, it's gonna be interesting                       |
| 18:56      | to see what they do with that                                        |
| 18:57      | because I think in some ways they are looking                        |
| 18:59      | to be kind of easier to use                                          |
| 19:03      | and not necessarily quite as pro user focused                        |
| 19:08      | as we can be with [[Launch Center Pro]].                                 |
| 19:11      | So we're actually working for next year                              |
| 19:15      | on revamping the whole launch experience,                            |
| 19:17      | even, and have some really cool ideas around                         |
| 19:20      | even more, I don't wanna give away too much.                         |
| 19:24      | And, you know, I can't promise a date                                |
| 19:29      | or anything like that, but just got some really                      |
| 19:32      | interesting ideas around making the launch experience                |
| 19:35      | even more customisable and fast and fun and easy to use.             |
| 19:40      | So, yeah, and I mean, [[NFC]] and 3.0,                                   |
| 19:45      | that's a whole new thing we're doing                                 |
| 19:48      | where you can tap an [[NFC]] tag, it pops a notification,                |
| 19:51      | you tap that and can launch anything, shortcuts,                     |
| 19:54      | and go deep into other apps and stuff like that.                     |
| 19:56      | [[iBeacon\|iBeacons]] is another great example                                    |
| 19:59      | of kind of how we compliment shortcuts.                              |
| 20:01      | You can have a set up an [[iBeacon]]                                     |
| 20:03      | to be a sort of proximity sensor                                     |
| 20:05      | so that when you get close to your vehicle,                          |
| 20:07      | it triggers a shortcut.                                              |
| 20:10      | We used to with, if this and that,                                   |
| 20:13      | be able to trigger in the background                                 |
| 20:14      | and with [[iBeacon\|iBeacons]].                                                   |
| 20:17      | And that's something we're actually exploring                        |
| 20:19      | to get back in the app in the near future.                           |
| 20:22      | Can I just stop for a second though,                                 |
| 20:24      | because you went over the NFC tag thing pretty quickly.              |
| 20:27      | Yeah, you know, that's like a major feature,                         |
| 20:30      | which for anybody who missed it,                                     |
| 20:32      | the iPhone XS, XS Max, and the XR can read an [[NFC]] tag                |
| 20:38      | without you having to, you know,                                     |
| 20:40      | open a specific application.                                         |
| 20:41      | Now, when I say read, I don't mean they're gonna like,               |
| 20:44      | oh, hey, there's this cool thing, I'm just gonna do it.              |
| 20:46      | That's a bit of a security risk                                      |
| 20:47      | and we know what [[Apple]] and security are like there.                  |
| 20:50      | Pretty, you know, dead set against anything                          |
| 20:53      | that's gonna do something the user really                            |
| 20:54      | doesn't want it to do.                                               |
| 20:57      | So can you just walk us through like the workflow                    |
| 21:00      | of how an [[NFC]] tag actually works                                     |
| 21:01      | with these lovely new phones, David?                                 |
| 21:04      | Sure.                                                                |
| 21:05      | So when [[Apple]] announced the iPhone XS,                               |
| 21:11      | XS Max, and XR, I don't even know                                    |
| 21:15      | if they said it in the keynote,                                      |
| 21:19      | but news sites started covering this whole background [[NFC]]            |
| 21:24      | and it was obvious pretty quick                                      |
| 21:26      | that that could be a really interesting thing                        |
| 21:28      | for [[Launch Center Pro]].                                                 |
| 21:30      | So I got some [[NFC]] tags and started experimenting                     |
| 21:33      | and yeah, it turned out really cool                                  |
| 21:38      | and we ended up printing thousands of [[NFC]] stickers                   |
| 21:41      | that hopefully aren't out of stock with this podcast errors.         |
| 21:45      | I didn't know how many to get                                        |
| 21:47      | and so I kind of got in the middle between conservative              |
| 21:51      | and like extravagantly stocked.                                      |
| 21:55      | So we printed custom [[NFC]] stickers                                    |
| 21:59      | that each have a unique ID.                                          |
| 22:02      | So you can set up multiple stickers                                  |
| 22:05      | to associate with multiple actions in [[Launch Center Pro]]              |
| 22:09      | and all you have to do is wake your screen                           |
| 22:12      | which on XS, XS Max, and XR, it wakes as you lift.                   |
| 22:18      | So the race to wake feature,                                         |
| 22:21      | you just pick up your iPhone,                                        |
| 22:23      | tap it down on the [[NFC]] sticker                                       |
| 22:26      | and it triggers a notification right there on the home screen        |
| 22:31      | and you tap that and within [[Launch Center Pro]]                        |
| 22:34      | you can configure that to do pretty much anything                    |
| 22:38      | with a combination of [[Launch Center Pro]] and [[Shortcuts]].               |
| 22:41      | So I have one set up in my car to start a podcast                    |
| 22:45      | and bring out maps if I need to search a place.                      |
| 22:49      | David, I know you told me via email                                  |
| 22:51      | that you have one set up at your writing desk                        |
| 22:54      | and I think one of the more compelling things                        |
| 22:56      | and David, you said this in the,                                     |
| 22:59      | or I guess I should call you Sparky.                                 |
| 23:01      | So you said this in the email                                        |
| 23:04      | that what's particularly compelling about the stickers               |
| 23:07      | and we've been hearing this more and more                            |
| 23:08      | from people who've been beta testing them                            |
| 23:10      | is that it creates this like physical visual link                    |
| 23:17      | to the digital world in a way that reduces friction                  |
| 23:22      | but also serves as a reminder.                                       |
| 23:24      | So one of the ways I've really been thinking about it                |
| 23:27      | and kind of building the marketing around this concept               |
| 23:31      | is that, yeah, I've heard it said                                    |
| 23:33      | that if you wanna go running every morning,                          |
| 23:36      | put your running shoes at the edge of your bed                       |
| 23:38      | or right on the floor where you get out of the bed                   |
| 23:41      | and that serves as a visual reminder to start this habit             |
| 23:46      | but then it also kind of greases the wheels a little bit.            |
| 23:51      | You don't have to go find the shoes.                                 |
| 23:53      | You don't have to even walk to the closet or anything.               |
| 23:56      | It just reduces friction ever so slightly enough                     |
| 24:01      | to kind of help reinforce that habit.                                |
| 24:03      | And so I see stickers in a similar light.                            |
| 24:05      | I think that, are they this like amazing, perfect,                   |
| 24:10      | like solve the world's problems kind of technology?                  |
| 24:15      | No, you can do the exact same thing in a today widget.               |
| 24:18      | You can open the app and launch things like,                         |
| 24:22      | but what the stickers do is they create                              |
| 24:24      | that visual reminder.                                                |
| 24:25      | So you can stick next to the fridge for your grocery list,           |
| 24:28      | stick it in the car for maps and podcasts and things.                |
| 24:34      | Stick it on your medication to trigger a medication reminder         |
| 24:38      | in three hours to retake.                                            |
| 24:40      | Or there's just so many ways that you can incorporate it.            |
| 24:43      | And what it does is it creates that visual reminder                  |
| 24:46      | that you need to do something                                        |
| 24:48      | and then it just greases the wheels ever so slightly.                |
| 24:50      | You don't have to swipe over to today's centre,                      |
| 24:53      | to the notification centre widgets,                                  |
| 24:56      | and then visually find what you're trying to tap.                    |
| 25:00      | It just greases the wheels even more                                 |
| 25:04      | to more efficiently get things done.                                 |
| 25:07      | So yeah, I'm super excited about the future.                         |
| 25:10      | I think it's unique.                                                 |
| 25:13      | It's been interesting for us releasing a physical product            |
| 25:16      | and having to inventory and fulfillment                              |
| 25:19      | and do all that kind of stuff.                                       |
| 25:21      | But yeah, hopefully this podcast will be released                    |
| 25:24      | a week or two after the app is out.                                  |
| 25:26      | So hopefully you guys are really enjoying that                       |
| 25:28      | and definitely give us feedback on what we can do                    |
| 25:31      | to improve the experience over time.                                 |
| 25:33      | David, sorry, Sparky, can you tell us what you're doing              |
| 25:36      | with the one on your writing desk?                                   |
| 25:37      | Because I've been experimenting with all sorts of use cases          |
| 25:39      | and at the moment, all of my [[NFC]] tags                                |
| 25:41      | are stuck down with sticky tags so that I can move them              |
| 25:43      | because I keep changing my mind as to what I want to do with them.   |
| 25:47      | And we've been kind of dancing around it,                            |
| 25:49      | but what they are, is they're stickers.                              |
| 25:51      | They're essentially digital stickers they have.                      |
| 25:54      | They have, I don't know what kind of magic they've got               |
| 25:57      | and some sort of digital nonsense                                    |
| 25:58      | that when your phone gets next to it, it triggers.                   |
| 26:02      | The phone recognises it and can act on it.                           |
| 26:04      | And [[Launch Center Pro]] can launch a *Launch Center* action              |
| 26:07      | based on the proximity or bumping up against the sticker.            |
| 26:12      | So it's a way to make your phone do things                           |
| 26:16      | just by being put in a specific space.                               |
| 26:19      | And to my knowledge, there's no other way to do that.                |
| 26:22      | Like we always complain about how [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                     |
| 26:25      | won't work automatically.                                            |
| 26:27      | You know, you have to go in the [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] app and trigger it.   |
| 26:29      | Well, this is an opportunity to trigger a Siri shortcut.             |
| 26:34      | And I have, because I'm a nerd, I have two desks.                    |
| 26:37      | I have one that has all my digital bits on it                        |
| 26:40      | and I have one where I do a lot of writing.                          |
| 26:43      | And so in the writing desk,                                          |
| 26:45      | though I still have a little stand that holds an iPhone              |
| 26:47      | because, you know, notifications come in and whatnot.                |
| 26:49      | So I just set the phone into that stand as I sit down                |
| 26:53      | and I just put that, I went, I committed,                            |
| 26:56      | I just put the sticker right in the stand there.                     |
| 26:58      | And when I put it in now, it opens up [[Day One]]                        |
| 27:02      | because the writing desk is where I do a lot of my like              |
| 27:05      | diary type entries.                                                  |
| 27:07      | And I found I wasn't using [[Day One]] enough,                           |
| 27:09      | but now I get this constant reminder.                                |
| 27:11      | I sit down, it opens [[Day One]] for me immediately.                     |
| 27:14      | And it does prompt me to use [[Day One]] more often.                     |
| 27:19      | And that's just a very simple use.                                   |
| 27:22      | I could actually, as we were sitting there thinking about it,        |
| 27:25      | I could tie it to a Siri shortcut.                                   |
| 27:27      | That starts the, you know, diary timer,                              |
| 27:30      | maybe puts it in do not disturb mode                                 |
| 27:32      | and then opens [[Day One]].                                              |
| 27:34      | Currently, I just have it launching the application.                 |
| 27:37      | But that, you know, that's just an example for me                    |
| 27:40      | for something that I wanted to become more deliberate about          |
| 27:43      | and using these stickers, it allows me,                              |
| 27:45      | it pushes it on to me a little more.                                 |
| 27:48      | That's a really good use case.                                       |
| 27:49      | I've got one, so I have like a little notebook.                      |
| 27:53      | It's like a [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com) notebook.                                    |
| 27:55      | Not exactly the same, because [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com)                            |
| 27:57      | is a little hard to get here in Europe, it smells good.              |
| 27:59      | But I've stuck a sticker to the front of that.                       |
| 28:02      | And because I take that with me to meetings                          |
| 28:04      | in case I need to like do something that for some reason             |
| 28:07      | or other, I can't do it on my iPad or my Mac.                        |
| 28:10      | And I touch my phone to that and it puts my phone                    |
| 28:12      | in do not disturb for the entire length of the meeting.              |
| 28:14      | And it creates, actually it creates a draft                          |
| 28:17      | because I'm basically testing [[Drafts]] for Mac                         |
| 28:20      | with the date and time of the meeting                                |
| 28:22      | and the name of the meeting as the title.                            |
| 28:24      | And because, you know, all of this is magic, essentially,            |
| 28:28      | there's wizardry and sorcery involved in this,                       |
| 28:30      | that that draft just appears on my Mac,                              |
| 28:32      | so then I can take my notes into it.                                 |
| 28:35      | And, you know, that's really useful.                                 |
| 28:37      | And then when I go back to my desk,                                  |
| 28:38      | I've got a, I've got another one there,                              |
| 28:40      | which is like my, at my desk one, which takes my phone               |
| 28:42      | out of do not disturb and things like that,                          |
| 28:45      | which is pretty nice.                                                |
| 28:46      | So Rose, how are you, how are you attaching it                       |
| 28:48      | to your notebook?                                                    |
| 28:48      | Cause obviously you're going to use up that notebook                 |
| 28:50      | at some point and get a new one.                                     |
| 28:52      | Okay, this is a really high tech solution.                           |
| 28:54      | You know, these punched pockets that you can buy,                   |
| 28:57      | like the ones that you put in a binder.                              |
| 28:58      | Essentially I have a small one of those                              |
| 29:00      | and I stuck it inside the notebook                                   |
| 29:02      | and the stickers just in there.                                      |
| 29:05      | But that's a really easy way to,                                     |
| 29:06      | because then I can reuse a sticker,                                  |
| 29:07      | because, you know, as David said, when the stickers                  |
| 29:11      | aren't free, they are selling them                                   |
| 29:12      | and I don't want to waste these stickers.                            |
| 29:14      | And this sticker is going to last a lot longer                       |
| 29:15      | than that notebook will.                                             |
| 29:17      | So it also means that I've got somewhere                             |
| 29:18      | when people give me things like business cards,                      |
| 29:20      | I've got somewhere to put them where they're not just                |
| 29:22      | going to fall out the second I put my notebook up wrong.             |
| 29:24      | I think that's a new term now, is it sticker worthy?                 |
| 29:27      | Yeah, yeah, that notebook is not yet sticker worthy,                 |
| 29:30      | but the sticker is notebook worthy.                                  |
| 29:33      | Yeah, well, and we're recording this just the day                    |
| 29:35      | before version three launches,                                       |
| 29:37      | but I personally cannot wait to hear                                 |
| 29:40      | how people start using these stickers.                               |
| 29:42      | Like David was talking about how he uses in the car.                 |
| 29:45      | What do you launch in your car with your sticker, David?             |
| 29:48      | Well, one of the more frustrating things,                            |
| 29:51      | so I have [[CarPlay]] in my car,                                         |
| 29:53      | one of the more frustrating things with [[CarPlay]]                      |
| 29:56      | is that it's supposed to always like pick up                         |
| 29:59      | the last bit of audio and just start playing,                        |
| 30:02      | but if you happen to be playing music at some point,                 |
| 30:06      | it picks a random song from the start of your library                |
| 30:11      | or stuff like that.                                                  |
| 30:12      | So I just have a really simple shortcut set up                       |
| 30:15      | to trigger [[Castro]], which shortcuts can do in the background          |
| 30:20      | because [[Castro]] has [[SiriKit]] integration                               |
| 30:24      | and they just launch maps.                                           |
| 30:25      | So I don't have a lot of appointments or commute,                    |
| 30:28      | I work out of the house.                                             |
| 30:30      | So if I were commuting every day,                                    |
| 30:33      | we have quite a few beta testers                                     |
| 30:35      | who are now using it in their car and with a commute,                |
| 30:40      | well, you can do all sorts of stuff.                                 |
| 30:42      | So you can calculate your ETA,                                       |
| 30:46      | text it to a loved one,                                              |
| 30:51      | bring up the maps with your home location already set up.            |
| 30:56      | You can trigger your trigger if to turn on the air conditioner       |
| 31:01      | or I mean, it's just like endless,                                   |
| 31:04      | what you can do shortcuts with these.                                |
| 31:07      | So yeah, mine is just real simple though,                            |
| 31:08      | just start a podcast so that I don't get whatever random audio       |
| 31:13      | is just gonna start playing when I plug in [[CarPlay]]                   |
| 31:16      | and then bring up maps in case I need to search.                     |
| 31:18      | So, but you know, it's just that again,                              |
| 31:20      | it's that several, it's reducing the friction.                       |
| 31:25      | So in the past, I get in the car,                                    |
| 31:28      | I've got to unlock my phone, find [[Castro]],                            |
| 31:32      | start playing or I get in the car and I just plug it in              |
| 31:35      | and then it's playing some random music.                             |
| 31:37      | I'm already halfway out the driveway,                                |
| 31:38      | then I gotta switch to [[Castro]]                                        |
| 31:41      | and get it playing the right podcast or whatever.                    |
| 31:44      | So it reduces that friction and brings maps right up.                |
| 31:48      | So if I need to search, then maps is there.                          |
| 31:49      | So I'm not, you know, jumping through multiple apps.                 |
| 31:52      | I'm not having to focus on getting everything set up                 |
| 31:55      | when I get in the car, I just get in the car,                        |
| 31:57      | tap the [[NFC]] sticker, hit the notification                            |
| 31:59      | and it does what I need it to do every time I get in the car.        |
| 32:03      | So it's really, it's really nice.                                    |
| 32:06      | Yeah, and also doesn't maps suggest locations                        |
| 32:10      | based on like upcoming events in your calendar?                      |
| 32:12      | So if you did have an event in your calendar                         |
| 32:14      | that at the very least has gotten a dress in it,                     |
| 32:16      | I think it would actually show that                                  |
| 32:17      | as a list of suggested destinations.                                 |
| 32:20      | Perhaps you need to type in the search box first                     |
| 32:22      | or something, but I think it does pop up in there.                   |
| 32:24      | That's one of their enhancements.                                    |
| 32:27      | Yeah, well, and now that we're talking about it,                     |
| 32:28      | what I should do is just create a shortcut that says                 |
| 32:31      | if there is a, and if there is a schedule item                       |
| 32:36      | on my calendar within an hour,                                       |
| 32:38      | then just populate with those directions.                            |
| 32:41      | I mean, so much that could be done.                                  |
| 32:44      | And you can even set the trigger                                     |
| 32:46      | if there's an event with a location.                                 |
| 32:49      | There's a way to do that.                                            |
| 32:50      | Oh, nice.                                                            |
| 32:51      | Yeah, yeah, you can filter for weather with that location.           |
| 32:55      | You know, it's just great, David,                                    |
| 32:57      | that you guys were able to do this.                                  |
| 32:59      | And I do love the combination of the physical world                  |
| 33:02      | and the digital world in ways like this.                             |
| 33:05      | And congratulations.                                                 |
| 33:06      | I think you're the first app that I'm aware of                       |
| 33:08      | that's really effectively done this.                                 |
| 33:10      | And when you combine it like you were saying earlier                 |
| 33:13      | with the magic that is [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                               |
| 33:16      | there's almost nothing you can't do with your phone                  |
| 33:20      | when you get it near one of these stickers.                          |
| 33:22      | So just everybody out there,                                         |
| 33:23      | let your mind wrap around that.                                      |
| 33:25      | Order five stickers from these guys.                                 |
| 33:27      | And just see what you can do with it.                                |
| 33:29      | Yeah, and the best part of it is                                     |
| 33:32      | stickers are not the only way that you can, you know,                |
| 33:34      | make use of all of this, which is fabulous.                          |
| 33:37      | There's so many options.                                             |
| 33:38      | Yeah, I kind of glossed over [[NFC]] stickers                            |
| 33:43      | because we were talking about just kind of all the ways              |
| 33:45      | that [[Launch Center Pro]] complements [[Shortcuts]].                        |
| 33:48      | And the next one on my list was scheduling.                          |
| 33:51      | So, you know, we've already done                                     |
| 33:54      | a lot of really cool stuff with scheduling.                          |
| 33:56      | In 3.0, you can assign,                                              |
| 33:58      | this was actually Rosemary's request.                                |
| 34:02      | You can schedule multiple,                                           |
| 34:04      | you can assign multiple schedules to the same action.                |
| 34:07      | So you can have a single action                                      |
| 34:10      | that triggers Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 8 a.m.,                   |
| 34:13      | Tuesday, Thursday at 9 a.m. and doesn't fire on the weekends         |
| 34:16      | or you can create these kind of complex rules and schedules          |
| 34:19      | around triggering actions.                                           |
| 34:21      | And of course, that gives you a notification                         |
| 34:24      | and then you can launch right into whatever you need to do.          |
| 34:29      | And on that front, I have been all but begging [[Apple]]                 |
| 34:34      | to give [[Launch Center Pro]] the critical alerts entitlement,           |
| 34:39      | which I think would be incredible                                    |
| 34:42      | if anybody at [[Apple]] listens to this,                                 |
| 34:43      | probably not or might not be in a position                           |
| 34:46      | to do anything about it, but if [[Launch Center Pro]]                    |
| 34:51      | were allowed to use that critical alerts entitlement,                |
| 34:54      | it would bypass *Do Not Disturb*.                                      |
| 34:56      | So you could use it as an alarm.                                     |
| 34:58      | So your morning alarm could be [[Launch Center Pro]]                     |
| 35:02      | where the alarm is guaranteed to wake you                            |
| 35:05      | even if Do Not Disturb is on or is silence on or whatever.           |
| 35:08      | But then also it's a notification                                    |
| 35:10      | that can then start your morning routine.                            |
| 35:13      | And even things like if you've got something scheduled               |
| 35:19      | that's mission critical, but you happen to be driving,               |
| 35:23      | well, if it's a schedule for [[Launch Center Pro]],                      |
| 35:26      | it might get lost in *Do Not Disturb*.                                 |
| 35:29      | So anyways, I'm hoping at some point,                                |
| 35:32      | [[Apple]] will give us access to that.                                   |
| 35:34      | And there's several other things                                     |
| 35:36      | that I don't wanna tip our hat too much                              |
| 35:40      | but or tip our hand too much.                                        |
| 35:42      | But we've got some other really cool ideas                           |
| 35:44      | around scheduling that we're working on                              |
| 35:46      | that should hopefully be out early next year.                        |
| 35:49      | This episode of Automators is brought to you                         |

| 35:54      | OmniFocus 3 has been released this year.                             |
| 35:57      | So for iOS, that's a fresh major update                              |
| 35:59      | that's been the gold trusted standard                                |
| 36:02      | to do application for 10 years.                                      |
| 36:05      | So it's the very first day of the App Store                          |
| 36:07      | and OmniFocus 3 for Mac is out as well                               |
| 36:10      | bringing significant improvements.                                   |
| 36:12      | It is the best OmniFocus ever.                                       |
| 36:14      | And you can download it right now for free                           |
| 36:17      | putting it through its paces with a 14 day trial.                    |
| 36:20      | And then you can get the standard or pro edition.                    |
| 36:23      | Use as of earlier versions of OmniFocus,                             |
| 36:26      | get a 50% discount off of this upgrade.                              |
| 36:30      | OmniFocus 3 has tags instead of context.                             |
| 36:32      | So you can give things both David and waiting on as a tag.           |
| 36:37      | Meaning that when you look at either list,                           |
| 36:39      | you'll see exactly what you're waiting on                            |
| 36:41      | and exactly what David needs to do for you.                          |
| 36:44      | Forecast view also shows your tasks                                  |
| 36:46      | and your calendar events in order.                                   |
| 36:47      | And I love this.                                                     |
| 36:48      | It's so good to be able to see what you need to get done             |
| 36:51      | before that meeting at four o'clock                                  |
| 36:53      | because you can do that in one place now.                            |
| 36:57      | Repeating tasks are even more powerful than ever.                    |
| 36:59      | The second Monday of every month,                                    |
| 37:01      | the last week day of every month, the first weekend day,             |
| 37:05      | all of this is possible in OmniFocus 3.                              |
| 37:08      | And on iOS, you've got batch editing from the Mac.                   |
| 37:11      | So if you need to add a tag to say four or five                      |
| 37:15      | different tasks, you can do that really easily.                      |

| 37:35      | you can use it to launch views from OmniFocus                        |
| 37:38      | and add tasks which are pre-formatted, just like shortcuts.          |
| 37:42      | But in fact, in an even more powerful way.                           |

| 37:55      | OmniFocus, accomplish more every day.                                |
| 37:57      | Our thanks to the Omni Group for their support                        |
| 38:01      | of this show and Relay FM.                                           |
| 38:04      | Rose, how are you, since you're the one                              |
| 38:06      | who instigated this, Rose, how are you using it?                     |
| 38:09      | Yes, everybody should blame me for this.                             |
| 38:11      | So essentially, it was because I had two slots                       |
| 38:14      | taken up by TestFlight.                                              |
| 38:16      | Because I'm sure most people listening to the show                   |
| 38:19      | are aware you can allow the app store to auto update.                |
| 38:22      | But if, like me, you beta test applications,                         |
| 38:25      | most of the apps that I use day to day                               |
| 38:26      | are beta applications, surprise.                                     |
| 38:29      | A lot of dots on your home screen.                                   |
| 38:31      | Yeah, there's an awful lot of dots there.                            |
| 38:34      | But TestFlight doesn't update automatically,                         |
| 38:36      | which in some cases is a good thing                                  |
| 38:38      | because every so often a developer will ship something               |
| 38:41      | and somebody will find something                                     |
| 38:42      | that's completely broken in it.                                      |
| 38:44      | And they'll be working on the fix                                    |
| 38:46      | and they'll post it in a [[Slack]] or send a message                     |
| 38:49      | or an email saying, like, don't update, like pause.                  |
| 38:52      | And for some reason, they can't pull it.                             |
| 38:54      | So it's good that you have to manually go in and update.             |
| 38:57      | But I wanted to be prompted to do that                               |
| 38:59      | because otherwise you might get the push notification                |
| 39:02      | to update, but you're in a meeting or something,                     |
| 39:04      | you forget.                                                          |
| 39:04      | And then so I was using [[TestFlight]] twice a day                       |
| 39:07      | by a [[Launch Center Pro]] at 8 AM and 9 PM                              |
| 39:10      | to prompt me to update all of those applications                     |
| 39:13      | on all of my devices,                                                |
| 39:14      | which we're now down to two iOS devices over here.                   |
| 39:17      | So I'm getting better or worse,                                      |
| 39:19      | depending on your point of view.                                     |
| 39:21      | Pure triples in the house.                                           |
| 39:23      | Well, especially because previously I had two iPads,                 |
| 39:26      | they had the 10.5 inch and the 12.9 inch iPad Pro,                   |
| 39:29      | the 12.9 inch would be at home.                                      |
| 39:31      | And I would, you know, and I'd get home                              |
| 39:33      | and I'd already updated my iPhone                                    |
| 39:35      | and my 10.5 inch iPad and I'd forget my 12.9                         |
| 39:38      | and I'd be there going, where is this feature?                       |
| 39:41      | Like, wasn't this here just like an hour ago?                        |
| 39:43      | And I've realised it was on the other iPad                           |
| 39:44      | because I hadn't updated [[TestFlight]] on this iPad yet.                |
| 39:48      | Or the applications in [[TestFlight]].                                   |
| 39:49      | So that's where that came from.                                      |
| 39:50      | And I've got all sorts of things where it's like,                    |
| 39:53      | okay, you know, at work at 9 AM,                                     |
| 39:55      | you know, it is actually 9 AM Mondays and Fridays.                   |
| 39:57      | I want reminders to open my [[OmniFocus]] review.                        |
| 40:02      | And it takes me straight to the review section                       |
| 40:04      | of OmniFocus so that I can review                                    |
| 40:06      | all of my work projects correctly, you know,                         |
| 40:09      | to make sure that I'm on top of things for the week                  |
| 40:10      | or, you know, that there's nothing missing                           |
| 40:12      | at the end of the week.                                              |
| 40:13      | I've still got the data to get anything out the door                 |
| 40:15      | that needs shipping desperately on a Friday.                         |
| 40:18      | And, you know, I was taking up two slots                             |
| 40:20      | for all of these or three slots and in one case, five slots.         |
| 40:24      | And yeah, it's nice to have all of that combined together now.       |
| 40:29      | So thank you for that.                                               |
| 40:30      | And what I'd also add is just if you used                            |
| 40:33      | [[Launch Center Pro]] a long time ago,                                    |
| 40:35      | and I know there's listeners out there who used it,                  |
| 40:37      | but then you eventually switched to [[Workflow]] or whatever,            |
| 40:40      | it's time to go back and look at this app again                      |
| 40:42      | because it does complement [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] so much.                    |
| 40:45      | And it's really, it's not your daddy's [[Launch Center Pro]].             |
| 40:49      | I mean, you guys, just going through the list of actions             |
| 40:52      | you've got available now and like all of the system stuff            |
| 40:55      | you've got in here, I mean, it is remarkable                         |
| 40:59      | how many things you can automate or simplify                         |
| 41:02      | into [[Launch Center Pro]].                                               |
| 41:03      | I mean, when I got in on the beta for version three,                 |
| 41:07      | this app immediately went back into my dock                          |
| 41:10      | because there's just so much I can do from this                      |
| 41:12      | that's faster than any other way I can do it on my phone.            |
| 41:15      | It's, or iPad, you guys really should be complimented                |
| 41:19      | for I know there was a ton of work                                   |
| 41:21      | that went into this new version.                                     |
| 41:22      | Yeah, thank you.                                                     |
| 41:23      | Yeah, and you know, it's interesting.                                |
| 41:25      | There's a lot that you aren't seeing also.                           |
| 41:29      | So, you know, [[Launch Center Pro]] is first created in 2012.             |
| 41:34      | You know, that's like the dark ages                                  |
| 41:37      | almost in an iPhone development time.                                |
| 41:41      | So we spent a considerable amount of time                            |
| 41:46      | over the last six to nine months                                     |
| 41:49      | re-architecting a lot of that in ways                                |
| 41:52      | that kind of build a solid foundation for the future.                |
| 41:55      | So 3.0 doesn't have as many features                                 |
| 41:59      | as we had wanted to get out.                                         |
| 42:01      | So we, I mean, there's so many cool things.                          |
| 42:03      | I'm not gonna, again, I don't wanna promise anything                 |
| 42:06      | because, you know, it always takes longer                            |
| 42:08      | than we anticipate and everything.                                   |
| 42:10      | But we have some really cool stuff that's in the works               |
| 42:14      | that 3.0 lays the foundation for.                                    |
| 42:17      | And, you know, one of the things like you were talking about         |
| 42:20      | how one of the great things about [[Launch Center Pro]]                   |
| 42:22      | is that it's just the quickest way to do a lot of things.            |
| 42:25      | Well, one of the things that we spent a lot of time on               |
| 42:28      | is optimising the launch speed                                       |
| 42:31      | and how fast it can trigger things.                                  |
| 42:33      | And so, you know, kind of important for a launcher app, right?       |
| 42:37      | And, you know, that's something we've always been working toward     |
| 42:42      | but with just all the cruft over the years in the code,              |
| 42:45      | it had slowed down a little bit.                                     |
| 42:47      | And so 3.0 is just lightning fast.                                   |
| 42:51      | And Dave Wood, who's, so Justin ended up getting a job               |
| 42:55      | a few years ago and that's kind of a whole long side story.          |
| 42:58      | And he kept trying to work on the app on the side                    |
| 43:01      | and it didn't work.                                                  |
| 43:02      | And so that's why [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]] has kind of been on hiatus            |
| 43:04      | a little bit for the last few years,                                 |
| 43:06      | was more job and timing and busy-ness                                 |
| 43:11      | versus not wanting to be working on the app.                         |
| 43:15      | So actually Justin kind of made me a very fair way                   |
| 43:22      | to kind of buy him out.                                              |
| 43:24      | I didn't have to, you know, put a bunch of cash up front             |
| 43:26      | or anything crazy.                                                   |
| 43:28      | But kind of put him aside.                                           |
| 43:31      | And Dave Wood, who's a fantastic programmer up in Canada,            |
| 43:37      | he's my new partner in the app.                                      |
| 43:40      | And guys just brilliant, fantastic coder.                            |
| 43:44      | And so what he's done in 3.0 and how fast this can launch            |
| 43:50      | and trigger things is just incredible.                               |
| 43:52      | And so, and again, not only is it just faster                        |
| 43:55      | but we've laid the foundation for some really cool stuff             |
| 43:58      | that should be coming early in 2019.                                 |
| 44:01      | I think that's always one of the things                              |
| 44:02      | with these applications.                                             |
| 44:04      | You know, if you just use the applications,                          |
| 44:06      | it's very easy to look at it and think,                              |
| 44:07      | oh, that's not a lot of work.                                        |
| 44:09      | I frequently see that most primarily on [[Reddit]]                       |
| 44:11      | where people are like, yeah, this app's not worth any money.         |
| 44:14      | Like I could program that in five minutes.                           |
| 44:16      | It's like, OK, do that.                                              |
| 44:19      | Because, you know, it's easy to say that, isn't it?                  |
| 44:22      | Yeah, we should mention that, though.                                |
| 44:23      | I mean, so the application now there's a free,                       |
| 44:25      | you can download it for free.                                        |
| 44:27      | And there are limitations on what you can do with it,                |
| 44:29      | with the free model.                                                 |
| 44:30      | But honestly, I think that's a great way                             |
| 44:32      | to get started with the app because it's still very powerful,        |
| 44:35      | even with the free limitations.                                      |
| 44:38      | And then if you want, you can subscribe to it                        |
| 44:42      | or you can just make a one-time purchase.                            |
| 44:45      | I went in with a one-time purchase.                                  |
| 44:47      | Why not, you know, let's just, I just love what you guys do.         |
| 44:50      | And I want to see this app continue into the future.                 |
| 44:52      | Thanks, we appreciate that.                                          |
| 44:54      | And one thing to note, you guys don't even know this yet.            |
| 44:57      | But in the final version, and this                                   |
| 45:00      | is kind of what we're going to be wrapping up over the weekend,      |
| 45:05      | transitioning to freemium and a subscription,                        |
| 45:08      | I know a lot of people aren't keen on subscriptions.                 |
| 45:12      | But for a pro app that's valuable and saves a lot of time,           |
| 45:17      | I think it makes a lot of sense both for us and for users.           |
| 45:23      | But then we recognise that for existing users,                       |
| 45:27      | you know, we didn't want to just create a whole new app              |
| 45:30      | and take things away or whatever.                                    |
| 45:32      | So we spend a lot of time making it                                  |
| 45:37      | so that people who have already paid,                                |
| 45:39      | they continue using all the features they've paid for.               |
| 45:42      | So we're not taking anything away from anybody.                      |
| 45:45      | We're not forcing you to go download another app.                    |
| 45:47      | You can continue using [[Launch Center Pro]] the way                     |
| 45:49      | you've always used it.                                               |
| 45:51      | The new features require a subscription or a one-time                |
| 45:55      | purchase.                                                            |
| 45:55      | But what we're doing over the weekend                                |
| 45:57      | is we're going to actually allow people to buy the features          |
| 45:59      | they want and need.                                                  |
| 46:00      | So if you love [[Launch Center Pro]] but aren't ever                     |
| 46:03      | going to schedule anything, aren't really interested in [[iBeacon\|iBeacons]],    |
| 46:07      | don't care about alternate icons or whatever,                        |
| 46:10      | you can just buy the [[NFC]] in-app purchase.                            |
| 46:14      | And so free app, buy one in-app purchase,                            |
| 46:17      | and that covers your needs.                                          |
| 46:18      | And that's a one-time purchase.                                      |
| 46:20      | We're never going to charge you again for [[NFC]].                       |
| 46:23      | We're going to continue to evolve those features.                    |
| 46:27      | So the same thing, what finally prompted us to do this               |
| 46:30      | is we got some feedback from beta testers who were saying,           |
| 46:32      | hey, I paid for [[Launch Center Pro]].                                   |
| 46:34      | I love the app.                                                      |
| 46:36      | But I don't like subscriptions or it                                 |
| 46:40      | seems like the one-time purchase to unlock everything                |
| 46:44      | is pretty steep.                                                     |
| 46:45      | All I really want is the new black theme for the true black          |
| 46:49      | theme for [[OLED]] devices.                                              |
| 46:52      | And so now you can buy it.                                           |
| 46:54      | You can buy just the theme pack.                                     |
| 46:55      | So any themes that we currently have and all future themes           |
| 46:59      | that we do, it's a one-time in-app purchase.                         |
| 47:01      | So I feel like we've, in 3.0, done the best job I've ever            |
| 47:08      | seen done in taking care of existing paid users,                     |
| 47:13      | but then also giving people opportunity                              |
| 47:15      | to either buy what they need or just go all the way.                 |
| 47:18      | And it is the one-time unlock is going                               |
| 47:22      | to be $25 for people who've paid in the past or $30                  |
| 47:26      | for new users.                                                       |
| 47:28      | So understand for an iOS app that that's pretty steep.               |
| 47:32      | But we've got a lot of stuff in the works.                           |
| 47:36      | There's a lot has gone into this app over the years.                 |
| 47:39      | And we think that's a really fair price.                             |
| 47:41      | But if you need just a couple of features,                           |
| 47:43      | you can buy a couple of features, no big deal.                       |
| 47:45      | Just use what you need, pay for what you need,                       |
| 47:47      | or unlock the whole app.                                             |
| 47:49      | So we feel like we've respected people who've                        |
| 47:51      | paid in the past and given new users great options                   |
| 47:55      | to just buy what they need.                                          |
| 47:56      | So it's kind of an interesting model for us                          |
| 47:59      | to make this big shift.                                              |
| 48:01      | So I hope I'm sure we'll get negative feedback no matter             |
| 48:04      | what we do.                                                          |
| 48:05      | That's just kind of the app store.                                   |
| 48:07      | But we did want to cover as many use cases as we can                 |
| 48:11      | and be respectful of users.                                          |
| 48:13      | Rose and I are going to, when this show publishes,                   |
| 48:15      | we'll put up maybe some short videos of how we're using              |
| 48:18      | [[Launch Center Pro]] and a few tips.                                    |
| 48:20      | But Rose, maybe we should all take turns talking                     |
| 48:23      | about some of our favourite uses for the application.                 |
| 48:29      | You want to go first?                                                |
| 48:29      | Yeah, that's a really great idea.                                    |
| 48:31      | Give some people some concrete examples                              |
| 48:33      | of what they can do with this.                                       |
| 48:34      | Sure.                                                                |
| 48:36      | All right, so I'll go first.                                         |
| 48:38      | At approximately 7 AM every morning,                                 |
| 48:41      | actually varies depending on the day of the week,                    |
| 48:43      | [[Launch Center Pro]] reminds me to use the scales.                      |
| 48:46      | And when I launch this, it launches a shortcut,                      |
| 48:48      | which asks me how much I weigh and what my body fat percentage       |
| 48:51      | is.                                                                  |
| 48:51      | And then it calculates my BMI and it saves that                      |
| 48:55      | into the health application for me                                   |
| 48:57      | so that I have all this data.                                        |
| 48:59      | Now, I don't necessarily actually use it every day,                  |
| 49:02      | but having it prompt me every day means                              |
| 49:03      | that if I miss it on a Monday, then I can always catch up            |
| 49:06      | on Tuesday or Wednesday and fill it in just                          |
| 49:08      | so I've got an approximate idea of what I weigh, which               |
| 49:11      | some days, especially Christmas, I eat too much chocolate            |
| 49:14      | and I'm well aware of that.                                          |
| 49:16      | I think you get a pass on Christmas.                                 |
| 49:18      | Yeah, exactly.                                                       |
| 49:19      | Christmas doesn't count.                                             |
| 49:23      | All food is zero calories on Christmas.                              |
| 49:25      | Yeah, definitely.                                                    |
| 49:26      | In fact, we can set up a [[Launch Center Pro]] reminder                  |
| 49:28      | to tell you that four times on Christmas Day.                        |
| 49:32      | Yes.                                                                 |
| 49:33      | And of course, we can actually share.                                |
| 49:35      | So what I'm going to do, I'm going                                   |
| 49:36      | to, in the blog post that accompanies this episode,                  |
| 49:39      | I'm going to share both the [[Launch Center Pro]] action                 |
| 49:41      | that you can install as well as the shortcut for that                |
| 49:43      | so that you can get the two-in-one package.                          |
| 49:46      | Yeah, so you're doing that the series shortcut                       |
| 49:48      | in the background.                                                   |
| 49:49      | Yeah, yeah.                                                          |
| 49:49      | So it then runs the Siri shortcut,                                 |
| 49:51      | but it does that at 7.15 approximately every day.                    |
| 49:55      | And I did consider tying it to an [[NFC]] tag,                           |
| 49:58      | but if I don't hit the NFC tag, then it won't prompt me              |
| 50:02      | on my phone and I would look at it and go, oh, OK.                   |
| 50:06      | I really think the NFC tags, the trick to that,                      |
| 50:09      | is not to find a place where you can force your phone                |
| 50:14      | into an [[NFC]] tag, but a place where your phone naturally              |
| 50:17      | hits an [[NFC]] tag, if that makes any sense.                            |
| 50:19      | Like when I'm at my writing desk,                                    |
| 50:21      | I am going to put the phone on that stand.                           |
| 50:24      | It's not something I'm doing deliberately                            |
| 50:27      | to trigger the NFC tag.                                              |
| 50:28      | I think that's the trick to it, is if you put an [[NFC]] tag             |
| 50:31      | where you have to remember to put the phone on top of that [[NFC]]       |
| 50:34      | tag, then it's not going to work.                                    |
| 50:36      | It's going to be like in your car,                                   |
| 50:38      | you set it into a cradle, which gets your car thing going.           |
| 50:42      | Or if you've got a place that the phone is already going,            |
| 50:46      | that's a great candidate for an [[NFC]] tag.                             |
| 50:49      | Yeah, or somewhere very close to it.                                 |
| 50:50      | Yeah, I think, I mean, from what I'm                                 |
| 50:52      | hearing from beta tester, it can actually work both ways.             |
| 50:55      | So one of the people who's given the most feedback,                  |
| 50:59      | he's got four or five different stickers set up.                     |
| 51:01      | And I haven't done this yet, but I                                   |
| 51:04      | think it's such a great idea is that aspect of being                 |
| 51:08      | a visual reminder.                                                   |
| 51:09      | So it's not necessarily where your phone is going,                   |
| 51:12      | but it's where you, as a human, are going and looking.               |
| 51:15      | So I mentioned this briefly earlier,                                 |
| 51:18      | but it's such a cool use case.                                       |
| 51:19      | He put a sticker in his refrigerator.                                |
| 51:21      | So you open the refrigerator, you see the sticker,                   |
| 51:24      | and it's like, oh yeah, I should add things to my grocery            |
| 51:28      | list when I'm standing at the refrigerator.                          |
| 51:30      | And so there is that ask, it can be in some ways                     |
| 51:34      | its own form of notification if you put it in a place where          |
| 51:39      | you're going to see it in a way that reminds you.                    |
| 51:41      | So even the scale example, if you put it right next,                 |
| 51:47      | like on the wall next to the scale,                                  |
| 51:49      | or on something or near something that you're going to see,          |
| 51:53      | I think that that is one way that it can work for some people.       |
| 51:57      | Though in my particular case, that's in the bathroom                 |
| 52:00      | and it gets pretty warm and humid in there.                          |
| 52:01      | And I'm also sure how well the sticker would stick.                  |
| 52:03      | And also there's nothing really to stick it to,                      |
| 52:05      | apart from the wall and then the paint.                              |
| 52:07      | Yeah, I'm safer in my case with a times reminder,                    |
| 52:11      | but yes, absolutely, the sticker can work like that.                 |
| 52:13      | And that's kind of how it works with my work notebook.               |
| 52:16      | I stack my phone on top of it, but that's                            |
| 52:18      | because I see the [[NFC]] tag.                                           |
| 52:21      | Real quick too, one thing that y'all don't know yet,                 |
| 52:23      | but will be public by the time this is out.                          |
| 52:27      | In addition to the [[Launch Center Pro]] icon stickers,                  |
| 52:30      | so we had custom printed stickers                                    |
| 52:32      | that show the [[Launch Center Pro]] icon.                                |
| 52:35      | We're also releasing clear stickers                                  |
| 52:39      | so that they'll blend in more and then white stickers                |
| 52:42      | that you can write on with a Sharpie.                                |
| 52:44      | So we'll kind of have a full suite of stickers                       |
| 52:46      | where you can kind of make it blend in a little more,                |
| 52:49      | you can write your own custom things                                 |
| 52:51      | where you can have the fun [[Launch Center Pro]] icon.                   |
| 52:55      | So yeah, there's gonna be lots of options for that as well           |
| 52:57      | as far as blending in a little more                                  |
| 52:59      | and having more options of where to stick things.                    |
| 53:02      | Okay, David.                                                         |
| 53:03      | So I just need to know if I can order those now.                     |
| 53:06      | Let's just get this over with.                                       |
| 53:10      | You cannot order them now.                                           |
| 53:13      | I will send you some personally.                                     |
| 53:16      | I will have them all live on the [[Contrast]] shop                       |
| 53:21      | hours before the app launches on Tuesday the 18th.                   |
| 53:24      | So by the time anybody's listening to this,                          |
| 53:26      | if they're not out of stock                                          |
| 53:28      | or if I've hopefully got them restocked                              |
| 53:31      | if they did go out of stock,                                         |
| 53:33      | you'll be able to buy them at [shop.contrast.co](https://shop.contrast.co)                       |
| 53:36      | or you can buy them within the app                                   |
| 53:38      | and if you're a subscriber, you'll get 10% off.                      |
| 53:40      | So it's kind of an automatic thing                                   |
| 53:42      | if you subscribe in the app                                          |
| 53:44      | and you purchase within the app,                                     |
| 53:45      | and you can use [[Apple Pay]] inside the app,                            |
| 53:48      | it'll automatically apply a 10% discount to your whole cart.         |
| 53:51      | So there'll also be t-shirts and mugs and hats                       |
| 53:56      | and I'm actually wearing my [[Launch Center Pro]] hat right now.         |
| 53:59      | So you'll get 10% off anything you wanna buy from the store          |
| 54:03      | and of course 10% off the stickers as well.                          |
| 54:05      | So.                                                                  |
| 54:06      | Yeah, I usually don't try to curry favor with guests,                |
| 54:08      | but in this case, I will take a freebie.                             |
| 54:10      | I will take it.                                                      |
| 54:11      | I'll tell you, Rose,                                                 |
| 54:15      | I think that's a great use of the scale.                             |
| 54:17      | My use of [[Launch Center Pro]] at this point                            |
| 54:20      | really is still pretty traditional in a lot of ways.                 |
| 54:24      | Like I have several shortcuts set up                                 |
| 54:27      | for sending text messages to groups and people that I know.          |
| 54:31      | I have a bunch of launching things.                                  |
| 54:33      | Like I've been really on this kind of spirit quest                   |
| 54:36      | about am I putting [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] on my home screen                  |
| 54:39      | or am I putting app icons?                                           |
| 54:41      | And at this point, it's kind of a mixture of them,                   |
| 54:44      | but [[Launch Center Pro]] allows me                                      |
| 54:46      | to have a really clean home screen                                   |
| 54:49      | and then get kind of the other stuff                                 |
| 54:51      | that I still want to access quickly,                                 |
| 54:53      | but not necessarily look at all the time into my dock.               |
| 54:57      | And I've really found it beneficial for that.                        |
| 54:59      | And it just makes getting things rolling                             |
| 55:02      | on my phone so much faster.                                          |
| 55:04      | A good example is the Omni Select Siri shortcut.                     |
| 55:09      | So I talked about this on a recent episode of Automators             |
| 55:12      | where I've created the Siri shortcut                                 |
| 55:13      | that is just a ton of different actions                              |
| 55:16      | that you can do in [[OmniFocus]].                                       |
| 55:19      | It's a combination of some of their [[URL Schemes]]                      |
| 55:21      | and some of my own custom [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                             |
| 55:23      | to get me to particular views                                        |
| 55:25      | and some to make specific new actions.                               |
| 55:28      | And it's a big list                                                  |
| 55:29      | and it doesn't make sense necessarily on my home screen,             |
| 55:33      | but it fits perfect in [[Launch Center Pro]]                             |
| 55:35      | and I access that multiple times a day.                              |
| 55:39      | And it's just a great way to get access to things like that.         |
| 55:42      | That I can see that being a really, really useful use case.          |
| 55:46      | There's a lot of words, use words in that, but yes,                  |
| 55:48      | I've been one of the really nerdy ones for quite a while.            |
| 55:52      | I use [[iBeacon\|iBeacons]] with [[Launch Center Pro]].                               |
| 55:54      | So David mentioned earlier, it's like a proximity sensor,            |
| 55:58      | because I work on the sixth floor at work                            |
| 56:00      | and I live on the fourth floor of this building.                     |
| 56:03      | And if I get a [[GPS]] reminder,                                         |
| 56:06      | that's like when I'm a block or so away generally.                   |
| 56:09      | I mean, it depends, but [[GPS]] isn't all that accurate.                 |
| 56:13      | And so if I do that, then I get a notification                       |
| 56:15      | that, hey, you wanted to do this when you got home                   |
| 56:18      | or when you got into the office.                                     |
| 56:19      | And by the time I've actually made it into the office                |
| 56:21      | or into my apartment, you know, it's grilled, that's gone.           |
| 56:24      | And so I use iBeacons,                                               |
| 56:25      | because then when I actually walk in the door                        |
| 56:27      | to my apartment, it reminds, it prompts me Monday to Friday          |
| 56:30      | to stop my commuting timer,                                          |
| 56:31      | because I'm interested in seeing which routes I take                 |
| 56:34      | from home from work and which one is the most optimal.               |
| 56:37      | Of course, the true note in me is shining out in this episode.       |
| 56:40      | And when I get to work, it prompts me to clock in                    |
| 56:43      | and it then check my [[OmniFocus]] work perspective                      |
| 56:47      | for the really urgent and important things                           |
| 56:50      | that are needing to be done this week.                               |
| 56:52      | And that's all really useful for me.                                 |
| 56:54      | And it wouldn't be possible without [[Launch Center Pro]].               |
| 56:57      | And for the listeners, I'm using [[iBeacon\|iBeacons]] too                        |
| 56:59      | and we are going to do a show on that soon.                          |
| 57:01      | So if you like that idea, put a pin in it, we're coming back.        |
| 57:05      | Yeah, essentially, if you're not sure what an [[iBeacon]] is,            |
| 57:08      | it's a [[Bluetooth]] little device                                       |
| 57:09      | and it is more accurate location based on where you put it.          |
| 57:13      | So it's not like saying to your phone, like,                         |
| 57:15      | hey, you're exactly a coordinates X, Y, Z, A, B, C.                  |
| 57:19      | It's more like, hey, phone, you made it here.                        |
| 57:21      | Like, here's the information that you're here.                       |
| 57:23      | And then in [[Launch Center Pro\Launch Center Pro's]] case, it takes that                  |
| 57:25      | and it turns it into whatever you've hooked it up to                 |
| 57:28      | on the other end that might be running a shortcut.                   |
| 57:30      | That might be, you know, prompting you to add a reminder             |
| 57:33      | to your [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list so that every time you go                     |
| 57:35      | to your grandmother's house, it prompts you to make sure             |
| 57:37      | that she hasn't installed viruses again on her computer,             |
| 57:40      | though you probably don't need to help remembering that.             |
| 57:42      | And things like that, yeah.                                          |
| 57:44      | And we've got some interesting things coming                         |
| 57:46      | on that front as well.                                               |
| 57:47      | So all the fun things in [[Launch Center Pro]] are gonna                 |
| 57:53      | see lots of new fun things to do in the near future.                 |
| 57:57      | So again, can't promise when, but there should be news               |
| 58:02      | on the iBeacon front in not too distant future.                      |
| 58:06      | I do feel like you're teasing us a lot, David.                       |
| 58:08      | I'm not sure if that's intentional or not.                           |
| 58:10      | It's because I wanna tell everybody all the cool stuff               |
| 58:15      | we have in the works, but I just don't,                              |
| 58:18      | I don't wanna make promises and then, you know,                      |
| 58:20      | sometimes things don't work out the way we intended.                 |
| 58:23      | And so if I say this is what we're doing                             |
| 58:25      | and then we aren't able to do it, I don't want anybody to,           |
| 58:28      | you know, buy the app based on exactly what we said                  |
| 58:30      | and then we have to do it a different way                            |
| 58:32      | or don't get to do it.                                               |
| 58:34      | So it's like, there's like so many cool things                       |
| 58:36      | we're working on that I want everybody to know about,                |
| 58:39      | but I just, so I'm teasing because I wanna tell everybody,           |
| 58:44      | but I know it's best to, especially in software,                     |
| 58:47      | to kind of bite my tongue and say,                                   |
| 58:49      | we've got cool stuff in the works,                                   |
| 58:50      | but, you know, it's not necessarily gonna work out                   |
| 58:53      | exactly the way we intend.                                           |
| 58:55      | So I'll make an announcement for each of these things                |
| 58:59      | as we know we can actually do what we think we can do.               |
| 59:02      | It's not bad.                                                        |
| 59:03      | Tell you what, we'll make you a deal.                                |
| 59:05      | You can come back on the show                                        |
| 59:06      | and then you can tell us about the cool things.                      |
| 59:08      | Yeah.                                                                |
| 59:09      | All right.                                                           |
| 59:10      | So David.                                                            |
| 59:11      | Hey, I didn't,                                                       |
| 59:12      | I was just gonna say I didn't get to tell y'all                      |
| 59:15      | how I use [[Launch Center Pro]].                                           |
| 59:17      | And I was about to ask you, so let's hear about it.                  |
| 59:21      | All right.                                                           |
| 59:22      | So here's my absolute favourite [[Launch Center Pro]] shortcut.             |
| 59:28      | And this is something that I actually don't use a ton,               |
| 59:31      | but when I use it, it is just so handy.                              |
| 59:34      | So I created a list in for [[Wolfram Alpha]]                             |
| 59:42      | that has my birthday, my wife's birthday,                            |
| 59:46      | the birthdays of our four kids and our wedding anniversary.          |
| 59:51      | So the list is just those dates.                                     |
| 59:53      | And then what it does is when you launch it,                         |
| 59:56      | it gives you the list                                                |
| 59:57      | and then you pick the name or the anniversary.                       |
| 01:00:01   | It sends the date to [[Wolfram Alpha]].                                  |
| 01:00:04   | And then in [[Wolfram Alpha]], you see that,                             |
| 01:00:08   | I've been married 11 years, one month and 25 days.                   |
| 01:00:12   | It's 581 weeks and six days.                                         |
| 01:00:15   | It tells you things that happened on that day.                       |
| 01:00:18   | It tells you the sunrise and sunset.                                 |
| 01:00:19   | So it gives you all this information                                 |
| 01:00:21   | about that specific day.                                             |
| 01:00:23   | And it's so handy having kids.                                       |
| 01:00:25   | The doctor asks, how many months is your newborn?                    |
| 01:00:29   | And it's like, okay, you're counting in your head.                   |
| 01:00:32   | Now I just launched my little thing,                                 |
| 01:00:35   | pick the kid's name,                                                 |
| 01:00:37   | and I can tell you down to the day how old he is.                    |
| 01:00:40   | And helpful for remembering,                                         |
| 01:00:42   | have we been married 10 years now?                                   |
| 01:00:44   | Or a lit err eh, and then hit the shortcut.                              |
| 01:00:48   | And I know exactly, so.                                              |
| 01:00:49   | Wow, man, you better be careful there, brother.                      |
| 01:00:52   | But that's just it.                                                  |
| 01:00:54   | He's being smart.                                                    |
| 01:00:55   | He's avoiding any potential issues                                   |
| 01:00:57   | by having this calculated for him.                                   |
| 01:00:58   | And that means that there is no margin for error                     |
| 01:01:01   | because that's one of the beauties of automation.                    |
| 01:01:03   | If you program it correctly or set it up right,                      |
| 01:01:06   | it will do it all perfectly for you, so.                             |
| 01:01:08   | And it's just always there and it's always correct.                  |
| 01:01:10   | I don't have to calculate in my head                                 |
| 01:01:12   | or try and remember.                                                 |
| 01:01:13   | And my wife forgets how long we've been married.                     |
| 01:01:16   | So we've had too many kids to be able                                |
| 01:01:20   | to keep that kind of stuff at the top of mind.                       |
| 01:01:22   | So here's the trick.                                                 |
| 01:01:23   | Get your wife for Christmas a nice hat                               |
| 01:01:25   | and put an [[NFC]] sticker on the inside.                                |
| 01:01:29   | Just hold your phone up,                                             |
| 01:01:33   | then let it run more formal for you.                                 |
| 01:01:34   | There you go.                                                        |
| 01:01:35   | Problem solved.                                                      |
| 01:01:36   | I'm sure she'll.                                                     |
| 01:01:37   | The best thing to do would be to put an [[iBeacon]] inside of it         |
| 01:01:40   | because then whenever you get nearer the wife's hat,                 |
| 01:01:43   | then you would get the information.                                  |
| 01:01:45   | I may or may not be considering embedding an [[iBeacon]]                 |
| 01:01:47   | into my boyfriend's phone.                                           |
| 01:01:48   | Okay, Rose, you can just ask him                                     |
| 01:01:51   | to just keep it on his forehead.                                     |
| 01:01:53   | There you go.                                                        |
| 01:01:56   | I mean, that would be a fashion statement.                           |
| 01:01:57   | Don't get me wrong.                                                  |
| 01:01:59   | I'm not sure it's kind of fashion statement                          |
| 01:02:00   | he's looking for, but.                                               |
| 01:02:04   | So a few of my other favourites.                                      |
| 01:02:08   | A lot of people don't realise [[Launch Center Pro]]                      |
| 01:02:10   | has a barcode scanner in it.                                         |
| 01:02:12   | So I have an action to scan a barcode                                |
| 01:02:15   | and launch a search in [[Amazon]].                                       |
| 01:02:17   | So if I'm out shopping and want to do a quick price check            |
| 01:02:21   | or even just want to add something to a wish list                    |
| 01:02:23   | that somebody else had or whatever,                                  |
| 01:02:26   | barcode scan to [[Amazon]].                                              |
| 01:02:29   | I do a lot of searching on the [[App Store]]                             |
| 01:02:31   | to kind of keep tabs on different categories                         |
| 01:02:34   | and that kind of stuff.                                              |
| 01:02:36   | So I have a whole bunch of pre-programmed [[App Store]] searches.        |
| 01:02:41   | And then I use a lot of the basic stuff too.                         |
| 01:02:43   | So call my wife, text my wife.                                       |
| 01:02:45   | It's funny, the saying cobbler shoes are always,                     |
| 01:02:50   | or I forget the exact same,                                          |
| 01:02:51   | but cobbler shoes are always a wreck or whatever.                    |
| 01:02:55   | And so I'm always testing and loading the default database           |
| 01:03:00   | and going back to older databases for testing and stuff.             |
| 01:03:04   | And it really messes me up                                           |
| 01:03:08   | when I am trying to do something                                     |
| 01:03:11   | and I happen to have a test database                                 |
| 01:03:13   | and not my personal database.                                        |
| 01:03:15   | So because I'd now just do so many basic things,                     |
| 01:03:19   | calling and texting and searching [[1Password]]                       |
| 01:03:21   | and launching.                                                       |
| 01:03:24   | Another thing a lot of people don't necessarily know                 |
| 01:03:26   | is you can share a URL from the [[Apple Notes\|Notes]] app on iOS.                    |
| 01:03:31   | And then that URL can be put in [[Launch Center Pro]]                    |
| 01:03:34   | and it'll take you right to a specific note                          |
| 01:03:36   | in the [[Apple Notes\|Notes]] app.                                                    |
| 01:03:38   | So I have several notes that I reference regularly                   |
| 01:03:42   | and so those are just icons in [[Launch Center Pro]] now                 |
| 01:03:45   | where I can get right to it.                                         |
| 01:03:46   | Another fun one is I put a clipboard action                          |
| 01:03:53   | to put a zero width space on my clipboard.                           |
| 01:03:57   | So if there's kind of little text things                             |
| 01:04:01   | or I also have another one to convert                                |
| 01:04:04   | whatever's on my clipboard to plain text.                            |
| 01:04:08   | So there's some kind of like fun text hacks                          |
| 01:04:10   | that you can do by manipulating the clipboard                        |
| 01:04:14   | and adding things to the clipboard.                                  |
| 01:04:17   | So yeah, that's kind of an overview.                                 |
| 01:04:20   | Yeah, that's exactly the kind of things that especially,             |
| 01:04:23   | I think a lot of our listeners they want to use                      |
| 01:04:26   | all this stuff and it sounds like it's really complicated            |
| 01:04:29   | but [[Launch Center Pro]] does have a really great action                |
| 01:04:31   | composer and it's got the ability to allow you                       |
| 01:04:35   | to input as part of the action.                                      |
| 01:04:38   | That sounds much more complicated.                                   |
| 01:04:39   | It will ask you for input as you do the action                       |
| 01:04:43   | which means that you can say, hey, when I do this,                   |
| 01:04:46   | I wanna be asked to dictate something                                |
| 01:04:49   | and then it's gonna run off and do something with that.              |
| 01:04:52   | And dictation has been amped up in this version as well,             |
| 01:04:55   | which is really nice or it can scan a barcode                        |
| 01:04:58   | or it can ask you to peck contact                                    |
| 01:05:00   | or input numbers or text or something                                |
| 01:05:04   | and it's really easy to do.                                          |
| 01:05:05   | And in some ways it's easier than [[Shortcuts]]                          |
| 01:05:08   | because you don't have to say like, okay,                            |
| 01:05:11   | I'm gonna ask for input                                              |
| 01:05:12   | and then I'm gonna take that ask for input                           |
| 01:05:13   | and I'm gonna put that into this field here.                         |
| 01:05:16   | It's just a case of, you know, you tap on that field                 |
| 01:05:20   | and then above the keyboard, there's this extra keyboard row         |
| 01:05:24   | where you've got like the first option                               |
| 01:05:27   | is a box with a cursor in it.                                        |
| 01:05:28   | And if you select that, then it allows you to choose                 |
| 01:05:30   | what kind of input you wanna put in there.                           |
| 01:05:32   | And then when you run the action,                                    |
| 01:05:33   | it's just gonna take whatever you input for that                     |
| 01:05:36   | and stick it right in that field and run it,                         |
| 01:05:38   | which is so nice to use.                                             |
| 01:05:40   | And I've actually got my parents using [[Launch Center Pro]].            |
| 01:05:43   | I don't think they realised they're using [[Launch Center Pro]].         |
| 01:05:45   | They probably have never heard of the application                    |
| 01:05:47   | apart from the fact it's this app that's on their home screen        |
| 01:05:50   | which they used to send me like the last picture                     |
| 01:05:52   | they took and stuff like that.                                       |
| 01:05:54   | I say, it's interesting to me that, you know,                        |
| 01:05:56   | [[URL Schemes]] were the brave new world for so long                     |
| 01:05:59   | and I feel like we've kind of,                                       |
| 01:06:01   | we're getting beyond that now to a certain extent.                   |
| 01:06:04   | But now the interesting thing that's happening                       |
| 01:06:06   | in automation at iOS is the ability to use the clipboard             |
| 01:06:10   | as a variable between applications.                                  |
| 01:06:14   | And this is another app that does that.                              |
| 01:06:16   | And, you know, it's fairly basic.                                    |
| 01:06:19   | It's only one dimensional,                                           |
| 01:06:20   | but it does give you that power                                      |
| 01:06:23   | that you wouldn't have otherwise.                                    |
| 01:06:25   | So we're always pushing the envelope on iOS.                         |
| 01:06:28   | Yeah, and I was gonna say,                                           |
| 01:06:29   | I actually have my mom using [[Launch Center Pro]] as well.              |
| 01:06:33   | It's funny because it is one of those apps                           |
| 01:06:36   | where, I mean, kind of like [[Shortcuts]]                                |
| 01:06:40   | where we as kind of automation nerds                                 |
| 01:06:44   | can go set things up for people                                      |
| 01:06:47   | who would never think to set them up for themselves                  |
| 01:06:51   | in a way that like meaningfully impacts their life.                  |
| 01:06:54   | So my mom's, my mom and dad's security system at the house,          |
| 01:07:00   | you can now text to turn it on and off.                              |
| 01:07:03   | So when they're getting in the car and leaving,                      |
| 01:07:05   | they can text to turn it on and text to turn it off.                 |
| 01:07:08   | Well, for months, my mom was like,                                   |
| 01:07:12   | getting in the car, pulling out, shutting the garage.                |
| 01:07:15   | Then she would like unlock the phone,                                |
| 01:07:18   | go to messages, scroll to find the alarm phone number thing,         |
| 01:07:24   | tap into that, then tap into the text field,                         |
| 01:07:27   | start typing on or off and then sending that message.                |
| 01:07:30   | And she did this for months, you know,                               |
| 01:07:33   | a good, you know, 60 seconds to two or three minutes                 |
| 01:07:37   | of her life every time she came and went from the house              |
| 01:07:41   | was spent doing this.                                                |
| 01:07:42   | And so I set her up with a pre-programmed                            |
| 01:07:49   | [[Launch Center Pro]] action, put it in her widget.                      |
| 01:07:51   | So now she just scrolls to notification centre,                      |
| 01:07:53   | taps one button and she still has an iPhone, I think seven           |
| 01:07:58   | plus, so she puts her finger on the thumbprint                       |
| 01:08:01   | and it does everything she needs to do.                              |
| 01:08:04   | So, you know, it's little things like that                           |
| 01:08:07   | where you can really, that time savings really adds up               |
| 01:08:12   | and it's fun when you can do that for other people                   |
| 01:08:15   | and show them how much time they really can save                     |
| 01:08:17   | with this silly, nerdy automation stuff                              |
| 01:08:20   | that we nerds mess around with.                                      |
| 01:08:23   | If your mom had a newer phone,                                       |
| 01:08:25   | you could put a sticker in her car                                   |
| 01:08:26   | and she could just tap the sticker and it would turn it on           |
| 01:08:29   | and that which is even, you know, easier.                            |
| 01:08:32   | My sister's been helping me get the,                                 |
| 01:08:35   | all the sticker inventory ready for launch                           |
| 01:08:39   | and she said the exact same thing the other day.                     |
| 01:08:42   | She has an iPhone 10 and my mom has, like I said,                    |
| 01:08:44   | like an iPhone seven, but she was seeing, they're like,              |
| 01:08:47   | oh man, can I set this up for mom                                    |
| 01:08:49   | where she can just tap the sticker                                   |
| 01:08:51   | to turn the alarm on and off?                                        |
| 01:08:53   | And I was like, no, cause she has an older phone                     |
| 01:08:56   | but when she upgrades, we're totally gonna set her up                |
| 01:08:58   | with that.                                                           |
| 01:08:59   | And my sister was of course like, how do I get a 10S now?            |
| 01:09:03   | She just bought a 10 like six months ago.                            |
| 01:09:06   | Yeah, you know, it's surprising to me                                |
| 01:09:07   | that they didn't put that feature in the new iPad Pros.              |
| 01:09:11   | I don't think they did, right?                                       |
| 01:09:12   | No, they did not.                                                    |
| 01:09:13   | They did not.                                                        |
| 01:09:15   | iPads do not have [[NFC]] at all, which is,                              |
| 01:09:19   | I can understand from one perspective,                               |
| 01:09:22   | I think they see the [[NFC]] as like [[Apple Pay]]                           |
| 01:09:27   | and card scanning and like ID card kind of replacements              |
| 01:09:33   | and getting in and out of buildings and things like that.            |
| 01:09:35   | So in some ways I can see that they don't think                      |
| 01:09:38   | that tapping an iPad to a sticker is a great use case,               |
| 01:09:42   | but I think they kind of looked past the potential                   |
| 01:09:46   | for apps like [[Launch Center Pro]]                                      |
| 01:09:49   | to make use of the technology.                                       |
| 01:09:50   | So who knows, like if this really takes off                          |
| 01:09:53   | and people really love it,                                           |
| 01:09:54   | maybe that will actually inspire them to put it                      |
| 01:09:57   | in future iPads.                                                     |
| 01:09:58   | So when can help?                                                    |
| 01:10:00   | And for anybody wanting that feature in the iPad,                    |
| 01:10:02   | the correct place to address this query                              |
| 01:10:04   | is apple.com/feedback.                                         |
| 01:10:07   | If we all tell [[Apple]] that we want it, then, you know,                |
| 01:10:09   | maybe you guys at [[Contrast\|Contrast Co]]                                        |
| 01:10:11   | will get the ability to implement that into the iPad.                |
| 01:10:13   | But to be clear, you can do all of the other stuff                   |
| 01:10:16   | on the iPad version, you know,                                       |
| 01:10:19   | and it's a hardware limitation,                                      |
| 01:10:21   | not a software limitation that we're up against here.                |
| 01:10:23   | So.                                                                  |
| 01:10:24   | Well, either way, I think that I'm just so happy                     |
| 01:10:27   | that you guys have just come on so strong                            |
| 01:10:29   | with this version three.                                             |
| 01:10:31   | And I love having [[Launch Center Pro]] back in my dock.                 |
| 01:10:34   | And not only have you made it more functional,                       |
| 01:10:37   | like you said earlier,                                               |
| 01:10:38   | the app is much snappier now                                         |
| 01:10:40   | and it's just a joy to use.                                          |
| 01:10:43   | And I know that wasn't trivial to pull it off.                       |
| 01:10:46   | So thanks so much for bringing this to us.                           |
| 01:10:48   | Thanks, I really appreciate that.                                    |
| 01:10:49   | Yeah, it's been a lot of late nights,                                |
| 01:10:52   | a lot of hard work, a lot of stress.                                 |
| 01:10:55   | Life as an indie developer can be pretty challenging,                |
| 01:10:58   | but, you know, coming on a podcast like this                         |
| 01:11:01   | and seeing it in people's docks again,                               |
| 01:11:04   | it's incredibly rewarding.                                           |
| 01:11:06   | And so I'm super thrilled                                            |
| 01:11:09   | that you guys are finding it useful.                                 |
| 01:11:11   | And, you know, as a app developer, you know,                         |
| 01:11:15   | I know I'm not out changing the world                                |
| 01:11:17   | or feeding hungry kids in Africa                                     |
| 01:11:19   | or doing that sort of thing,                                         |
| 01:11:21   | but it's really cool that, like,                                     |
| 01:11:23   | I can impact other people's lives                                    |
| 01:11:25   | and help them speed things up                                        |
| 01:11:27   | and make their lives just a little bit better.                       |
| 01:11:28   | So, you know, I find a lot of meaning in doing this                  |
| 01:11:31   | and I'm really excited                                               |
| 01:11:33   | that people are enjoying 3.0 so much.                                |
| 01:11:35   | So I appreciate all the feedback                                     |
| 01:11:38   | and just appreciate that people like and use it.                     |
| 01:11:42   | Well, for me has definitely been a gateway drug                      |
| 01:11:45   | to automation and I am definitely a very happy user                  |
| 01:11:50   | of version.                                                          |
| 01:11:51   | I don't think I use [[Launch Center Pro\|Launch Center]] itself,                            |
| 01:11:53   | but I did use another app which you had,                             |
| 01:11:55   | which was very similar called [[Contacts]]                               |
| 01:11:57   | and I've been using [[Launch Center Pro]] for a very long time.          |
| 01:12:00   | So it's great to have it back in my dock                             |
| 01:12:03   | because that's where it deserves to be.                              |
| 01:12:05   | So Rose, what's in your dock right now?                              |
| 01:12:08   | My dock currently contains three applications.                       |
| 01:12:11   | It contains [[Drafts]], [[OmniFocus]] and [[Launch Center Pro]].                 |
| 01:12:15   | I've got [[Drafts]], [[Launch Center Pro]] and Fantastic Health.             |
| 01:12:20   | How about you, David, what's in your dock?                           |
| 01:12:25   | I guess I'm the odd man out here.                                    |
| 01:12:29   | I have [[Apple Mail\|Mail]], [[Launch Center Pro]], [[Safari]]                               |
| 01:12:34   | and my weather app, [[Weather Up]].                                     |
| 01:12:36   | So.                                                                  |
| 01:12:36   | Yeah, I live in California.                                          |
| 01:12:37   | I don't even need a weather app.                                     |
| 01:12:39   | It's just got the window.                                            |
| 01:12:41   | Well, getting, you know, our half hour automation show               |
| 01:12:44   | once again doubled our estimate.                                     |
| 01:12:47   | So we're sorry about keeping you a long time,                        |
| 01:12:50   | but it was, there was just a lot to talk about                       |
| 01:12:52   | and we're both, Rose and I are super happy                           |
| 01:12:54   | that [[Launch Center Pro]] is back.                                      |
| 01:12:56   | I feel like we're entering a new golden age of automation            |
| 01:12:59   | on iOS, so we're really happy to share this stuff with you.          |
| 01:13:02   | Go check out [[Launch Center Pro]].                                      |
| 01:13:03   | It's a great app.                                                    |
| 01:13:04   | Like I said, they've got a model that works for you.                 |
| 01:13:07   | Download it.                                                         |
| 01:13:08   | If you really want to have fun, get on the store                     |
| 01:13:11   | and order some of these stickers                                     |
| 01:13:12   | and it's pretty magical making your iPhone, you know,                |
| 01:13:16   | just do things when you just set it down in a dock.                  |
| 01:13:18   | I think that's great.                                                |
| 01:13:20   | Thanks to our sponsor today, Omni Group                              |
| 01:13:22   | with a new version of OmniFocus out for Mac and iOS.                |
| 01:13:26   | And where can we find you, David,                                    |

| 01:13:37   | You can find [[Launch Center Pro]] at [[Launch Center Pro]],                 |
| 01:13:40   | no spaces, and then [contrast.co](https://contrast.co) is the website.                      |
| 01:13:46   | Yeah, that's about it.                                               |
| 01:13:47   | There will be links to that.                                         |

| 01:13:58   | and what stuff you're nerding out with.                              |
| 01:14:01   | And if you've got some of these [[NFC]] tags,                            |

| 01:14:11   | David, where can people find you?                                    |
| 01:14:13   | I'm David.                                                           |
| 01:14:13   | I met Sparky on the web, [macsparky.com](https://macsparky.com)                               |
| 01:14:16   | and MacSparky on [[Twitter]].                                            |

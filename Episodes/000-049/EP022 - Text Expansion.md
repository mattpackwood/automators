| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Well, we have a surprise for our listeners.                                              |
| 00:02      | Don't we, David?                                                                         |
| 00:03      | Yes, we do.                                                                              |
| 00:04      | Merchandise.                                                                             |
| 00:05      | I'm very excited.                                                                        |
| 00:06      | Yes, everybody's favourite podcast                                                        |
| 00:09      | has t-shirts and hoodies available for you.                                              |
| 00:11      | And we know you were really your favourite podcast.                                       |
| 00:13      | So that is us.                                                                           |
| 00:15      | We certainly have one of the coolest logos,                                              |
| 00:17      | which really lends itself to you.                                                        |
| 00:19      | The title is over in Cotton Bureau,                                                     |
| 00:21      | Automator's Assemble,                                                                    |
| 00:22      | because it looks so much like Captain America.                                           |
| 00:24      | That's what I thought.                                                                   |
| 00:26      | I hope I don't get in trouble for saying that.                                           |
| 00:28      | But either way, we got a cool t-shirt                                                    |
| 00:30      | and a zippered hoodie with a 3D...                                                       |
| 00:36      | What's the fancy term for this, Rose?                                                    |
| 00:38      | It's...                                                                                  |
| 00:38      | Embroidered logo?                                                                        |
| 00:39      | Yes, embroidered logo on the zippered hoodie.                                            |
| 00:42      | I know that I'm going to get one of each,                                                |
| 00:44      | but the zippered hoodie I'm very excited about.                                          |
| 00:46      | We had to, like, kind of negotiate with them                                             |
| 00:48      | to get this because it's a larger size                                                   |
| 00:51      | embroidered 3D logo.                                                                     |
| 00:53      | It's very nice.                                                                          |
| 00:54      | If you got one of the [[Cortex]] hoodies,                                                    |
| 00:56      | it's like that.                                                                          |
| 00:57      | It looks really great.                                                                   |
| 00:59      | We'll put some pictures and links in the show notes                                      |
| 01:01      | so you can go check it out.                                                              |
| 01:02      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 01:03      | And I have to say, the Cotton Bureau stuff,                                              |
| 01:06      | the reason why we've gone with Cotton Bureau                                             |
| 01:07      | is because we know the people at Cotton Bureau                                           |
| 01:09      | and the quality there is really good.                                                    |
| 01:12      | So that's why we've gone with their stuff                                                |
| 01:13      | because we know we're not going to be sending you                                        |
| 01:15      | something that you're going to go,                                                       |
| 01:16      | oh my gosh, this is terrible,                                                            |
| 01:17      | and it falls apart after one run through the washing machine.                            |
| 01:20      | So we hope you're going to be really happy with it.                                      |
| 01:22      | I have to say I'm wearing one of the hoodies right now                                   |
| 01:24      | and it's very snugly and warm,                                                           |
| 01:26      | but not too warm.                                                                        |
| 01:27      | So I'm quite impressed with it.                                                          |
| 01:29      | I have to say I'm going to be wearing mine at some                                       |
| 01:31      | of our meetups actually.                                                                 |
| 01:33      | Yes, me too.                                                                             |
| 01:34      | WWDC baby going to have my automators assemble gear on.                                  |
| 01:38      | So go check it out.                                                                      |
| 01:40      | We put a link in the channel.                                                            |
| 01:41      | Like I said, you'll probably hear about this a couple times,                             |
| 01:43      | but it is a limited time campaign.                                                       |
| 01:46      | It doesn't run forever.                                                                  |
| 01:47      | So if you want to get them,                                                              |
| 01:48      | get in there and get them now.                                                           |
| 01:50      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                        |
| 01:52      | And hopefully the very least for people who are resident                                 |
| 01:55      | in the U.S., these are going to arrive in time to wear at WWDC                           |
| 01:59      | as well, which means that if you are thinking of getting one                             |
| 02:01      | to wear it to wear the meetups,                                                          |
| 02:03      | it should fingers crossed arrive in time barring                                         |
| 02:05      | any postal delays.                                                                       |
| 02:07      | So that should be good too.                                                              |
| 02:09      | And so what are we going to promise                                                      |
| 02:10      | if you're wearing an automators assemble anything?                                       |
| 02:14      | High fives?                                                                              |
| 02:15      | Definitely high fives and selfies.                                                       |
| 02:17      | We can, we can offer selfies.                                                            |
| 02:18      | And there may be stickers as well.                                                       |
| 02:20      | Yes, all these stickers.                                                                 |
| 02:22      | All right.                                                                               |
| 02:22      | That said, if you, if you don't want to get a t-shirt                                    |
| 02:25      | and you still want to come to the meetup, that's okay.                                   |
| 02:26      | We're not going to turn you away.                                                        |
| 02:27      | You will still be able to get a selfie.                                                  |
| 02:30      | Can't promise a high five though.                                                        |
| 02:31      | That may have to be negotiated.                                                          |
| 02:33      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 02:34      | All right.                                                                               |
| 02:35      | Well, go get your gear and we will see you wearing it at WWDC.                           |
| 02:42      | Hello, and welcome to Automators.                                                        |

| 02:51      | Hello, David.                                                                            |

| 02:54      | You ready to talk some text expansion?                                                   |
| 02:56      | I am.                                                                                    |
| 02:57      | It's, it's a very good episode because as, as I'm stealing                               |
| 03:01      | from your outline is this is the gateway drug to automation                              |
| 03:04      | in many ways.                                                                            |
| 03:06      | Yeah, I know it is because it's easy and it's a low barrier                              |
| 03:10      | to enter, to entry and it's a high payoff and it's something                             |
| 03:13      | that we've been talking about off and on throughout the show,                            |
| 03:16      | but we thought we'd just take one show to talk really deep                               |
| 03:19      | about text expansion and how that works.                                                 |
| 03:21      | But before we do that,                                                                   |
| 03:22      | we've got a few announcements.                                                           |
| 03:25      | The meetups are still taking on new attendees.                                           |
| 03:29      | Just heard from a friend the other day coming all the way                                |
| 03:31      | from Las Vegas to join our Orange County meetup.                                         |
| 03:34      | That's pretty cool.                                                                      |
| 03:35      | That is nice.                                                                            |
| 03:36      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 03:37      | There's a lot more spaces in the Orange County meet up                                    |
| 03:40      | than there are left in the WWDC meetup,                                                  |
| 03:42      | but we're probably going to be having the WWDC meet up outdoors.                          |
| 03:46      | So space hopefully won't be an issue on that front.                                      |
| 03:50      | Yeah, same thing down here in Orange County.                                             |
| 03:52      | So there's room for you.                                                                 |
| 03:53      | Go sign up.                                                                              |
| 03:54      | We're going to have a great time.                                                        |
| 03:55      | We're looking forward to it.                                                             |
| 03:58      | And just sign up.                                                                        |
| 04:00      | It's free.                                                                               |
| 04:01      | We'll have fun.                                                                          |
| 04:02      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 04:03      | So let's talk about text expansion.                                                      |
| 04:05      | The Gateway Drug to Automation.                                                          |
| 04:08      | It is.                                                                                   |
| 04:09      | The text expansion is something that started showing up                                  |
| 04:15      | inward processors years ago, but then it kind of grew                                    |
| 04:20      | to the operating systems.                                                                |
| 04:22      | And I want to talk about the Apple operating system                                      |
| 04:24      | implementation in general later.                                                         |
| 04:27      | But, you know, the idea behind text expansion is real basic.                             |
| 04:30      | It's you type one thing and then the computer is monitoring                              |
| 04:34      | your keystrokes and says, oh, she just typed that.                                       |
| 04:38      | I want to turn that into something else.                                                 |
| 04:40      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 04:40      | The most common example is type cell like as in cell phone,                              |
| 04:45      | but with two C's and anytime it sees that C C E L L,                                     |
| 04:50      | it backs up the cursor, erases what you just typed                                       |
| 04:53      | and writes your cell number for you.                                                     |
| 04:55      | And it's much easier to type cell than it is to use the                                  |
| 04:59      | parentheses and the dashes and hit that number row up above                              |
| 05:03      | your keyboard and, you know, enter your, your phone number.                              |
| 05:05      | So, I mean, that's the kind of thing people were thinking                                |
| 05:08      | about it.                                                                                |
| 05:08      | The first time I ever saw text expansion used was in                                     |
| 05:12      | Microsoft Word, I believe, where they had a big library of                               |
| 05:16      | typos, you know, things that you commonly mistype and it would                           |
| 05:20      | back it up and fix it for you.                                                           |
| 05:22      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 05:23      | I used to use that all the time because I learned to type                                |
| 05:27      | fairly early.                                                                            |
| 05:28      | I was about 11 and I actually took piano lessons because I                               |
| 05:30      | wanted to learn to type, don't tell my mother.                                           |
| 05:33      | That's weird.                                                                            |
| 05:34      | I know, but it turns out I actually enjoyed piano lessons.                               |
| 05:37      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 05:37      | Well, I enjoy piano, so it worked out pretty well.                                       |
| 05:40      | But so I learned to type pretty early on, but I was fairly                               |
| 05:45      | quick at typing.                                                                         |
| 05:46      | I'm also quite quick at reading, but with speed,                                         |
| 05:48      | sometimes you lose accuracy.                                                             |
| 05:50      | And I got bored with maybe speaking teacher's typing, so I                               |
| 05:53      | never really followed it through and that meant that, of                                 |
| 05:56      | course, there'll be lots of mistakes.                                                    |
| 05:57      | And at one point, I think we'd be using, I want to say word                              |
| 06:02      | perfect or some earlier version of like a Microsoft rich                                 |
| 06:08      | text editor that wasn't Word, but it wasn't like notepad.                                |
| 06:11      | And I was using that and I handed the work in the teacher                                |
| 06:17      | lunch and said, no, but go home.                                                         |
| 06:19      | Too many spelling errors.                                                                |
| 06:20      | Try and fix it and so finding that you could do this in                                  |
| 06:24      | Microsoft Word saved my bacon.                                                           |
| 06:26      | Yeah, you know, it's really nice.                                                        |
| 06:27      | And if you're doing that already, congratulations.                                       |
| 06:30      | You're already an automator because you are doing some                                   |
| 06:32      | sort of automation at that kind of entry level text                                      |
| 06:36      | expansion automation.                                                                    |
| 06:38      | Some of the things I do and did very early was not just, you                             |
| 06:44      | know, I started thinking kind of outside of the box of things                            |
| 06:46      | that I type routinely.                                                                   |
| 06:47      | If I have a client with an odd name, you know, that's spelled                            |
| 06:51      | odd, you know, and and it's hard for me to remember.                                     |
| 06:54      | I just have a short name for them in my head or maybe just                               |
| 06:58      | the first name with the last initial and then it will                                    |
| 07:01      | automatically go and type that in.                                                       |
| 07:04      | As an attorney, I do a lot of research and writing and we                                |
| 07:08      | have very specific citation formats for, you know, as a                                  |
| 07:12      | lawyer, you have to go find old court cases and court cases                              |
| 07:15      | are found in different books published by different people                               |
| 07:18      | and the way the courts want you to cite those, you know,                                 |
| 07:22      | the volume and page number of those books so the judge can                               |
| 07:26      | go find the case too is very specific.                                                   |
| 07:29      | But that's a perfect example of something that lends itself                              |
| 07:32      | to basic text expansion and I've been doing that my whole                                |
| 07:35      | career.                                                                                  |
| 07:36      | Yes, I can see that being very useful as it turns out with                               |
| 07:39      | citations.                                                                               |
| 07:40      | I actually use an application called Zotero and there's                                  |
| 07:43      | lots of things that you could use with academic citations,                               |
| 07:46      | but legal citations are from what I understand just a little                             |
| 07:49      | bit different to academic ones.                                                          |
| 07:50      | You know, they're all the same.                                                          |
| 07:52      | I mean, they're not the same, but they're the same.                                      |
| 07:54      | You know, you just got to get some sort of easy way to get                               |
| 07:59      | it in like, I mean, like I can tell you like if I type CA3,                              |
| 08:05      | that's CalAP third, which is, you know, I mean, it's just                                |
| 08:08      | like it's muscle memory for me at this point.                                            |
| 08:11      | But but you have to have if you when you type it out,                                    |
| 08:14      | you've got to have the periods in the right places, you know,                            |
| 08:18      | whether or not there are spaces.                                                         |
| 08:19      | There's all these problems you have and text expansion at its                            |
| 08:22      | most basic level solves that problem.                                                    |
| 08:25      | Now, it started out in word processors, but then very quickly                            |
| 08:29      | the operating system vendors started to realise, hey, this                               |
| 08:32      | is something we should do.                                                               |
| 08:33      | They've got it on Windows.                                                               |
| 08:35      | They've got it on Mac.                                                                   |
| 08:36      | They've got it even now on iOS.                                                          |
| 08:37      | It took a while to get to iOS, but they they've got text                                 |
| 08:41      | expansion at the most basic level.                                                       |
| 08:43      | You find it in the settings on your Mac or if you go into                                |
| 08:47      | the settings on your iOS device under general, then keyboard,                            |
| 08:52      | it's under there.                                                                        |
| 08:52      | It's kind of hard to find if you don't know it's there.                                  |
| 08:56      | For the longest time, the synchronisation, the iCloud                                    |
| 08:59      | synchronisation of text expansion snippets was terrible.                                 |
| 09:05      | I mean, it was to me, it was like the poster child of bad iCloud                         |
| 09:09      | for, I don't know, like for four years or something.                                     |
| 09:12      | And it was just amazing to me that like you would go in there                            |
| 09:16      | and you would type in a new snippet and it just would not                                |
| 09:19      | propagate or it would.                                                                   |
| 09:21      | It was like not consistent after after I left my old firm                                |
| 09:25      | because I like had one called elaw, E-L-A-W and that's my                                |
| 09:31      | email for my legal address.                                                              |
| 09:34      | And for whatever reason for years, it would put in the                                   |
| 09:38      | email address for my old law firm.                                                       |
| 09:40      | It just, it refused to update that and I would delete it.                                |
| 09:45      | Oh man, I did so much crazy stuff, Rose.                                                 |
| 09:48      | At some point, I think I reinstalled iOS.                                                |
| 09:51      | And it still didn't fix it?                                                              |
| 09:53      | Yeah, just because I couldn't get it to work.                                            |
| 09:54      | And oh man, it made me so crazy.                                                         |
| 09:56      | But now it does work now, yeah.                                                          |
| 09:58      | Yeah, now it works.                                                                      |
| 09:59      | So I guess I shouldn't go on about it.                                                   |
| 10:01      | But it, for the longest time, that was a problem.                                        |
| 10:05      | But it's there and the nice thing about that is it's system                              |
| 10:08      | wide, you know, when it's just in Microsoft Word, all the                                |
| 10:13      | effort you put into creating these text expansion snippets                               |
| 10:16      | are only good in Microsoft Word.                                                         |
| 10:18      | Once it hits the operating system, you can use them                                      |
| 10:20      | in any application you want.                                                             |
| 10:23      | The OS expansion does have its limitations.                                              |
| 10:27      | Like for example, one that just drives me baddie is the                                  |
| 10:33      | requirement to have a leading space in order to do an                                    |
| 10:37      | expansion.                                                                               |
| 10:38      | This is something you may not know.                                                      |
| 10:40      | I mean, it is kind of a power user feature.                                              |
| 10:43      | But like for instance, sometimes I wanted to use in tech                                 |
| 10:48      | and OmniFocus, I want to insert a little TextExpander                                   |
| 10:53      | or TextExpander.                                                                        |
| 10:54      | You can see where I'm going with this, right?                                            |
| 10:56      | I want to insert a little text expansion before a word                                   |
| 11:00      | like when I use the capture tool on iOS to capture a link                                |
| 11:05      | into OmniFocus and I want to put read and review this article                            |
| 11:09      | or consider linking to this article.                                                     |
| 11:12      | I have all these different little like phrases that I                                    |
| 11:16      | insert before something I've put in OmniFocus.                                           |
| 11:19      | But I can't use that with the built-in expansion snippets                                |
| 11:23      | because it has to have a leading space.                                                  |
| 11:25      | So you literally have to like get the cursor to the beginning                            |
| 11:29      | of the line, hit the space then backspace without deleting                               |
| 11:33      | the space you just created.                                                              |
| 11:34      | And then you can run the built-in snippet.                                               |
| 11:36      | So I feel like the operating system is great for typos                                   |
| 11:42      | and citations and the stuff we've been talking about.                                    |
| 11:45      | But it also has its limitations.                                                         |
| 11:48      | It definitely does.                                                                      |
| 11:49      | You can't include things like line breaks either,                                        |
| 11:51      | which is really unfortunate because I have quite a few                                   |
| 11:55      | different email signatures is the wrong phrase for it                                    |
| 11:59      | because I have of course email signatures built into the                                 |
| 12:02      | various different mail applications that I keep switching                                |
| 12:05      | through on a regular basis.                                                              |
| 12:07      | But I do before my email signature I'll usually write                                    |
| 12:11      | something depending on who I'm writing to.                                               |
| 12:14      | It might be a theme from see you soon to with best regards                               |
| 12:19      | depending on the tone of the email.                                                      |
| 12:20      | But I can't have it do a line break after that and then put                              |
| 12:24      | something else in, which is quite frustrating.                                           |
| 12:28      | I have to say.                                                                           |
| 12:29      | Yeah, I mean in some of the snippets I'm going to talk                                   |
| 12:31      | about later are quite advanced and almost all of them use                                |
| 12:35      | line breaks and you just can't do it.                                                    |
| 12:38      | So I don't think they're really trying to make the built-in                              |
| 12:42      | operating system automation as an automation tool as the way                             |
| 12:48      | some of these other developers are.                                                      |
| 12:51      | And it's nice that it works.                                                             |
| 12:52      | It's nice that it syncs.                                                                 |
| 12:53      | It could be better.                                                                      |
| 12:54      | It's perfect for little things like email addresses,                                     |
| 12:57      | phone numbers, stuff like that.                                                          |
| 12:59      | But that is wonderful.                                                                   |
| 13:01      | Yeah, but it could be better.                                                            |
| 13:02      | Honestly, yeah, but this is like I said the start for so many                            |
| 13:06      | people and I think text expansion, you know, you think                                   |
| 13:11      | about the tool belt like a carpenter wears everybody has                                 |
| 13:13      | a screwdriver in their tool belt.                                                        |
| 13:15      | I feel like text expansion is like that screwdriver.                                     |
| 13:17      | It's there's just so many things you can do with this type                               |
| 13:21      | of automation and it really is automation.                                               |
| 13:24      | I mean the there is a trigger and there is an action in this                             |
| 13:28      | case, the trigger as you type a phrase in the action is                                  |
| 13:30      | it does something with that phrase.                                                      |
| 13:33      | And once you kind of get that internalised and you and you                               |
| 13:36      | put on your automator hat because you're listening to this                               |
| 13:38      | show, you have an automator hat.                                                         |
| 13:40      | You might not know it, but you do.                                                       |
| 13:42      | Suddenly you can really make magic happens and and that's why                            |
| 13:46      | we've made reference to text expansion type automation                                   |
| 13:49      | throughout the run of the show.                                                          |
| 13:51      | And that's why I feel like a lot of developers started to                                |
| 13:55      | say what more can I do with that?                                                        |
| 13:58      | Yeah, I mean, it's it's one of these things where a lot of                               |
| 14:00      | people are going, hmm, actually, this is something that is                               |
| 14:03      | very easy to understand.                                                                 |
| 14:04      | And if you if you're there going, well, I'm not sure I'm                                 |
| 14:07      | going to see use case.                                                                   |
| 14:08      | Don't worry, we've got a whole rest of the podcast convinced                             |
| 14:10      | you.                                                                                     |
| 14:13      | This episode of automators is brought to you by back place,                              |
| 14:16      | the unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs that starts at                               |
| 14:19      | just $6 a month.                                                                         |
| 14:22      | I've been using back place for a long time and the reason is                             |
| 14:26      | I don't want to have that data disaster that we always hear                              |
| 14:29      | about here at the automators.                                                            |
| 14:32      | You know how it goes.                                                                    |
| 14:33      | You think you've got everything covered.                                                 |
| 14:34      | You think you've got it all backed up, but it's gone.                                    |
| 14:36      | Maybe someone breaks in and steals your computer and your                                |
| 14:39      | attached backup drive or maybe haven't tested your backup                                |
| 14:42      | drive and it just goes bad.                                                              |
| 14:44      | Having that second off site backup is the way to really                                  |
| 14:48      | protect yourself and that's the back place does.                                         |
| 14:50      | You just set it up.                                                                      |
| 14:51      | It puts a little application in your menu bar and it starts                              |
| 14:55      | uploading your drive off site for you.                                                   |
| 14:58      | I think this is just a necessary step whenever you're going                              |
| 15:02      | to have a backup.                                                                        |
| 15:02      | It it's just in 2019.                                                                    |
| 15:05      | It's silly not to have a off site backup because it's just                               |
| 15:09      | your data is too important.                                                              |
| 15:10      | So, so how do you get started?                                                           |

| 15:20      | up your documents, your music, photos, videos, drawing,                                  |
| 15:23      | projects, everything that's important to you.                                            |
| 15:25      | Sometimes you need access to a file on a go.                                             |
| 15:28      | Guess what Backblaze has got you covered?                                                   |
| 15:30      | You can use the super easy mobile application to access                                  |
| 15:33      | all your data anywhere in the world, even from your phone.                               |
| 15:37      | We're on vacation in Hawaii a few years ago and I needed                                 |
| 15:40      | something that was on the archive drive that's attached                                  |
| 15:43      | to my Mac.                                                                               |
| 15:43      | Of course, I didn't have access to it, but I just use the                                |
| 15:46      | Backblaze app on my iOS device.                                                          |
| 15:49      | Got it.                                                                                  |
| 15:49      | No problem.                                                                              |
| 15:50      | Backblaze is backed up over 750 petabytes and counting.                                  |
| 15:55      | I don't even know what a petabyte is to be honest with                                   |
| 15:57      | you, but I think that's a lot of data and they've done 750                               |
| 16:01      | of those that's the equivalent of 750 million gigabytes.                                 |
| 16:05      | Well, there you go.                                                                      |
| 16:05      | I just answered my own question.                                                         |
| 16:07      | These guys know their stuff.                                                             |
| 16:08      | If you did have a data disaster, Backblaze can ship you                                  |
| 16:12      | a hard drive with all your data on it.                                                   |
| 16:14      | And once you've restored your precious documents, you can                                |
| 16:17      | send the hard drive back for a full refund.                                              |
| 16:19      | Backblaze has restored over 35 billion files.                                            |
| 16:23      | That's a lot of safe projects, assignments and family photo                              |
| 16:26      | albums.                                                                                  |
| 16:27      | Having backups means total peace of mind.                                                |
| 16:30      | It's the difference between a data disaster costing you                                  |
| 16:33      | hours upon hours of work and just having a hard drive                                    |
| 16:36      | shipped to you.                                                                          |
| 16:37      | You know, you're in good hands because Backblaze are loved                               |
| 16:40      | by recommended by the Verge, Macworld, Next, Lifehacker                                   |
| 16:44      | Lifewire, 9to5Mac and more.                                                      |
| 16:47      | I'll tell you, I have been so happy to have this Backblaze                               |
| 16:50      | subscription when my daughter went off to school.                                        |
| 16:52      | I bought one for her.                                                                    |
| 16:53      | I just think that anybody that is operating a computer in                                |
| 16:57      | addition to having a local backup should have an offsite                                 |
| 16:59      | in Backblaze is my weapon of choice.                                                     |
| 17:02      | So avoid that looming disaster.                                                          |
| 17:04      | Go to backblaze.com/automators for your unrestricted                               |
| 17:08      | free trial and let them know you heard about it here on                                  |
| 17:10      | the automators.                                                                          |

| 17:14      | So that's backblaze.com/automators.                                                |
| 17:17      | Go there now.                                                                            |
| 17:18      | Thank you Backblaze for saving us from countless data                                    |
| 17:20      | disasters and for their support of this show and Relay FM.                               |
| 17:26      | Okay.                                                                                    |
| 17:26      | So some third party developers decided text expansion is                                 |
| 17:30      | great.                                                                                   |
| 17:30      | Let's do more with that.                                                                 |
| 17:31      | And the poster child for this is our occasional sponsor                                  |
| 17:35      | TextExpander.                                                                           |
| 17:37      | Now, the TextExpander is an occasional sponsor of the                                   |
| 17:40      | automators.                                                                              |
| 17:40      | In fact, they were the first sponsor of this show once                                   |
| 17:43      | they heard we were doing it.                                                             |
| 17:44      | They said we wanted and we appreciate that, but they are                                 |
| 17:47      | not sponsoring today's episode.                                                          |
| 17:49      | They don't even know we're recording it.                                                 |
| 17:51      | We didn't want it.                                                                       |
| 17:52      | You know, this was just, we wanted to talk about text                                    |
| 17:55      | expansion and TextExpander is a part of the conversation.                               |
| 17:58      | And so this is not, they're not paying us to talk about it.                              |
| 18:02      | So what does it do?                                                                      |
| 18:03      | It does the basic expansion.                                                             |
| 18:04      | We were talking about it's system wide.                                                  |
| 18:07      | It syncs between platforms.                                                              |
| 18:09      | A few years ago, they made some real architectural changes                               |
| 18:13      | to the application that allows it to work on Mac iOS and                                 |
| 18:16      | even Windows.                                                                            |
| 18:17      | So if you've got a Windows machine at work, your snippets                                |
| 18:20      | will, will go across and they have a great system in                                     |
| 18:24      | place for shared snippet libraries.                                                      |
| 18:26      | I know roses shared some live shared a bunch over at                                     |
| 18:28      | macsparky.com/te snippets.                                                         |
| 18:32      | And even if you go on their website, they've got a bunch                                 |
| 18:34      | there you can download.                                                                  |
| 18:35      | So they, it's, you know, they've, they've got all the,                                   |
| 18:38      | the basic text expansion stuff covered.                                                  |
| 18:41      | They also have collaboration, which is built in.                                         |
| 18:43      | We're not going to really talk about that today much,                                    |
| 18:45      | but for instance, I collaborate with my assistant and                                    |
| 18:48      | we have a shared bank of snippets.                                                       |
| 18:50      | So when I change links and things for customer support                                   |
| 18:53      | emails, she uses the same phrase, but the snippet                                        |
| 18:57      | gets updated on the back end, which is really cool.                                      |
| 18:59      | But what we want to talk about today is TextExpander                                    |
| 19:03      | as an automator tool.                                                                    |
| 19:05      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 19:06      | And believe me, it is a really good one.                                                 |
| 19:09      | And personally, I'm just all over the JavaScript support                                 |
| 19:12      | in it, but I think we're going to get to that in a moment.                               |
| 19:14      | Aren't we?                                                                               |
| 19:15      | Yeah, I think let's kind of work through it because                                      |
| 19:17      | there's a lot you can do with it.                                                        |
| 19:19      | Working our way up to JavaScript.                                                        |
| 19:23      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 19:23      | You don't have to be a programmer to do automation                                       |
| 19:27      | with TextExpander.                                                                      |
| 19:27      | That's one of the things I like about it.                                                |
| 19:30      | So they've got different categories they've added to                                     |
| 19:33      | the years to text expansion in TextExpander that, that goes                             |
| 19:38      | beyond what you get with the general system things.                                      |
| 19:41      | One of those is text tokens, and it's very easy when                                     |
| 19:45      | you're creating a snippet, they just did an update that made                             |
| 19:47      | it even easier to insert a token to represent something                                  |
| 19:50      | like the date and time.                                                                  |
| 19:53      | And, and it allows you to very, very much customise that.                                |
| 19:57      | You know, you can use like the, the date, the month as a                                 |
| 20:01      | number or the month spelled out or the date abbreviated                                  |
| 20:05      | or the date as a number, no matter how you want to format                                |
| 20:08      | a date and a time you can do with TextExpander.                                         |
| 20:11      | And the nice thing is you can insert that into a snippet.                                |
| 20:15      | And one of the things I do across all of my systems                                      |
| 20:18      | is I often date stamp entries and like for each client                                   |
| 20:24      | or matter, I may have a little text file I've got in Ulysses                             |
| 20:29      | and every time we get on the phone, I can just type it for                               |
| 20:33      | me, it is X DTS, which is X, which is the key I used to                                  |
| 20:39      | start telling my Mac, I'm going to about to do a snippet                                 |
| 20:41      | and DTS is date and time stamp.                                                          |
| 20:45      | Or if I go X DS, it's X, it's a date stamp.                                              |
| 20:48      | It just gives the date, but often like someone will call                                 |
| 20:51      | me, I just open up my file or I'll even do it in [[Drafts]]                                 |
| 20:55      | and I go X DTS and then boom, it puts the current date and                               |
| 20:59      | time as a stamp in and then I can start typing, you know,                                |
| 21:03      | based on what we're talking about and what I'm following                                 |
| 21:05      | up on.                                                                                   |
| 21:06      | And then once I either save that to Ulysses or if I'm in                                 |
| 21:09      | Drafts, I move it to Ulysses.                                                            |
| 21:11      | I've got that recorded and sitting there, you know,                                      |
| 21:15      | probably five to, you know, 10 times a day and typing that                               |
| 21:21      | date and time stamp and manually is a complete pain in the                               |
| 21:23      | neck.                                                                                    |
| 21:23      | So this is an example of the advantage of a token.                                       |
| 21:27      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 21:28      | And the advantage of this as well is for anybody who's                                   |
| 21:32      | listening, who's ever done that thing where you type the                                 |
| 21:34      | same thing so often, you don't know whether or not you're                                |
| 21:37      | spelling it correctly anymore and you look at the word                                   |
| 21:40      | February and you go, so one hour or two in February,                                     |
| 21:45      | there's two, but you know, you look at it and you start                                  |
| 21:47      | thinking it's wrong with this.                                                           |
| 21:48      | You don't even worry about that because you know it's                                    |
| 21:50      | right every single time and that is one of the significant                               |
| 21:53      | advantages and it means if you're sending documents out                                  |
| 21:56      | with date formatting in, it's always consistent because                                  |
| 21:59      | there's nothing worse than going through a document and                                  |
| 22:01      | going, well, in this place, they've written this like                                    |
| 22:04      | this and this place, they've written it like that.                                       |
| 22:06      | That is one of the great things about using                                         |
| 22:08      | TextExpander for this because you can just do it and it will                                 |
| 22:11      | be the same every time.                                                                  |
| 22:13      | I have to say I use the time stamps a lot more because at                                |
| 22:17      | work we have to, we have to check what we've done throughout                             |
| 22:19      | the day as a duty so that we know that where our time is                                 |
| 22:22      | going approximately so that we know, okay, for example,                                  |
| 22:25      | this project is ready to go into another department for                                  |
| 22:29      | maintenance versus it's still inactive development and I                                 |
| 22:33      | use the date stamps all the time and I have it formatted                                 |
| 22:36      | as 24 hour with no code long, which is something I would                                 |
| 22:39      | usually do if I was typing the time and it is so useful                                  |
| 22:42      | for that because I just, I type, I can't even remember,                                  |
| 22:46      | I type XH, that's it, XH and then I get the other current                                |
| 22:50      | time because I don't ever have XH's in my words apparently.                              |
| 22:54      | So I, you know, one of the things I do is I send out monthly                             |
| 22:59      | bills for the legal practice and the subject line will say                               |
| 23:03      | Sparks law slash, you know, April invoice or whatever                                    |
| 23:08      | the current month is and that's the same thing.                                          |
| 23:09      | It's a TextExpander snippet and it's using, instead of using                            |
| 23:13      | the full date, all it's using is the current month.                                      |
| 23:16      | But I just never have to think about it, you know, the invoices                          |
| 23:19      | go out, it says the right thing at the top of the, I mean,                               |
| 23:22      | the last thing you want to do is send out an invoice and have                            |
| 23:25      | the wrong month listed in the subject line, you know, and                                |
| 23:28      | you know, it's just like everything in your life that                                    |
| 23:31      | involves a date or time, why not automate it, make it always                             |
| 23:35      | right with something like this feature in TextExpander?                                 |
| 23:40      | Yes, yeah, it is perfect, things like that.                                              |
| 23:43      | But as well as this, you can do the, the, the calculations.                              |
| 23:46      | So you can do date and time mass, like adding a year or                                  |
| 23:49      | subtracting three days, things like that, which is really                                |
| 23:52      | useful if you want to say, you know, I'll get this done by                               |
| 23:55      | this time next week.                                                                     |
| 23:56      | Okay.                                                                                    |
| 23:57      | And then you can type whatever snippet user side is going                                |
| 23:59      | to be for this time next week.                                                           |
| 24:01      | And then it will put in next week's date and time or next                                |
| 24:04      | week's date is probably more realistic for you without you                               |
| 24:08      | having to get out your calendar and go, okay, so what day is                             |
| 24:12      | it today right now?                                                                      |
| 24:13      | If I add week to that, well, actually Monday, you get sucked                             |
| 24:17      | into your calendar.                                                                      |
| 24:18      | You just type next week and it does it for you, which is                                 |
| 24:21      | perfect.                                                                                 |
| 24:21      | I use that quite frequently as well.                                                     |
| 24:24      | Yeah, it's great.                                                                        |
| 24:25      | And, um, and that, but that's just one feature.                                          |
| 24:28      | You can also do a special characters, um, you know, we talked                            |
| 24:33      | about the carriage return, which is just so essential, like                              |
| 24:36      | even just like making something as simple as an email signature.                         |
| 24:39      | You need that carriage return, but it also includes keys like                            |
| 24:43      | the escape key, the return key and the tab key.                                          |
| 24:46      | For me, the tab key is the real golden child of this feature                             |
| 24:51      | because that just opened so many doors for you in terms of                               |
| 24:55      | automation.                                                                              |
| 24:56      | Um, for instance, when you're sending an email, um, you know,                            |
| 25:00      | traditionally, you would have to have one snippet to do the                              |
| 25:04      | subject line and one snippet to do the body of the email.                                |
| 25:07      | But with the tab key enabled, you can now have one snippet that                          |
| 25:13      | creates the current like, like I was just talking about that                             |
| 25:16      | one with the invoicing, it uses the, um, it puts the date in                             |
| 25:21      | with the proper, you know, format of the current month and                               |
| 25:24      | then it hits the tab key.                                                                |
| 25:25      | Well, what happens in any email application when you hit the                             |
| 25:29      | tab key jumps to the subject line, you know, the subject of                              |
| 25:32      | the email, you know, or I guess the body, you'd call it.                                 |
| 25:36      | So having the tab key there allows you to have one snippet                               |
| 25:39      | that you, that you can fire off in the sub in the subject or                             |
| 25:43      | the subject line, and then it'll type the subject and then hit                           |
| 25:47      | the tab key and go to the body and start typing that for you                             |
| 25:50      | too.                                                                                     |
| 25:50      | And it allows you to get two for one basically.                                          |
| 25:53      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 25:54      | And it, that is really useful because I've got a little story                            |
| 25:57      | here.                                                                                    |
| 25:58      | Uh, there, the ticket system that I work with at work.                                   |
| 26:00      | So I, I program a bunch of things at work and including                                  |
| 26:03      | enhancements to our ticket system.                                                       |
| 26:04      | Um, and it has a rest EPO, which means I can give you a                                  |
| 26:08      | rest EPO, which means I can go crazy and everything via that.                            |
| 26:11      | There are some things that you can't do through this.                                    |
| 26:14      | Um, and when GDPR was coming up, I had to set up something                               |
| 26:17      | which you could only do via a Java applet.                                               |
| 26:20      | And I had to fill out 16 fields in the Java applet.                                      |
| 26:23      | And I had to click, okay, click a few more things and then fill                          |
| 26:26      | out those same 16 fields exactly the same way.                                           |
| 26:29      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 26:30      | 28 times.                                                                                |
| 26:31      | You know what I did?                                                                     |
| 26:32      | I made a TextExpander snippet.                                                          |
| 26:34      | I would open it, type three characters, and it would do                                  |
| 26:36      | everything for me.                                                                       |
| 26:37      | So I was sitting there watching TV, click, click, type three                             |
| 26:40      | characters, give it a few moments done next.                                             |
| 26:43      | That saved me so many hours that evening.                                                |
| 26:46      | And I went into work the next day and my boss said,                                      |
| 26:48      | how long were you working last night?                                                    |
| 26:50      | And I said, Oh, not much.                                                                |
| 26:51      | You know, I got TextExpander to do it for me, which is perfect                          |
| 26:54      | for that.                                                                                |
| 26:55      | Oh, you're better than I am.                                                             |
| 26:56      | I would have been like, Oh man, I was working so hard.                                   |
| 26:59      | Oh, my, my boss thought I did work very hard because I found                             |
| 27:02      | a smarter way to do it and so the, the slower way to do it.                              |
| 27:05      | So he was pleased with me.                                                               |
| 27:06      | You also can use that tab key on web forms, you know, so you                             |
| 27:10      | can often go to the same web forms.                                                      |
| 27:13      | You can map it out with the tab keys and actually create                                 |
| 27:16      | entries very quickly.                                                                    |
| 27:18      | Just a lot you can do with those special characters.                                     |
| 27:21      | And then another thing that TextExpander can do is it can use                           |
| 27:25      | a clipboard, which is a secret weapon in my mind.                                        |
| 27:29      | I feel like a lot of people don't realise that or don't think                            |
| 27:32      | about how they can use it.                                                               |
| 27:33      | A good example for me, which is kind of like your example is                             |
| 27:36      | sometimes as a lawyer, I have to send out what they call                                 |
| 27:39      | discovery.                                                                               |
| 27:40      | It's just, it's a fancy legal term says I have to ask, ask                               |
| 27:43      | you questions.                                                                           |
| 27:44      | And often there are questions that are somewhat related like                             |
| 27:47      | I had a case recently that involved some, some government                                |
| 27:52      | contracts and they've got these super long numbers attached                              |
| 27:55      | to these contracts.                                                                      |
| 27:56      | And for each contract that I had like 10 questions, you know,                            |
| 28:00      | when was it entered, who signed it, were there any changes?                              |
| 28:03      | You know, it was like 10 essentially boilerplate questions                               |
| 28:07      | I was going to ask over and over again for all 10 contracts.                             |
| 28:11      | And I got thinking, well, I don't want to, you know, I don't                             |
| 28:14      | want to go in and manually do this.                                                      |
| 28:16      | You know, there were 10 contracts, 10 questions, 100                                     |
| 28:19      | questions at a right.                                                                    |
| 28:20      | And I didn't want to have to do this over and over again.                                |
| 28:22      | So I just had a text list of the 10 contract numbers.                                    |
| 28:27      | And once I created the one set of 10 questions, I put in a                               |
| 28:33      | placeholder for, in text expanded, you can do this, say                                  |
| 28:37      | insert the clip, the contents of the current clipboard.                                  |
| 28:39      | So just like you can insert the date, you can insert the                                 |
| 28:42      | contents of your clipboard.                                                              |
| 28:43      | So all I had to do once I set that up was I would just go to                             |
| 28:48      | the, to the Word document.                                                               |
| 28:50      | I would select and copy the first contract member into the                               |
| 28:54      | copy buffer, and then I would go into the Word document.                                 |
| 28:57      | I typed the text expansion snippet and boom, it would hit 10                             |
| 29:01      | with that contract number.                                                               |
| 29:02      | Then I went and copied the second contract number.                                       |
| 29:05      | Did the same thing.                                                                      |
| 29:06      | I did that 10 times and drastically reduced the amount                                   |
| 29:10      | of time it took me to put together something kind of                                     |
| 29:12      | complicated.                                                                             |
| 29:13      | And not only was it nice because it was done fast.                                       |
| 29:16      | I knew that each one had exactly the right number and exactly,                           |
| 29:20      | you know, there were, there were no mistakes in essence where                            |
| 29:23      | I had had someone type it, who knows what would have happened.                           |
| 29:26      | Yes, that, that is a perfect use case.                                                   |
| 29:29      | Lawyers are terrible.                                                                    |
| 29:30      | You know, if you get like one number wrong in the contract                               |
| 29:32      | number, they'll say, well, we never signed that contract.                                |
| 29:34      | We didn't, you know, because one of the numbers was off.                                 |
| 29:36      | So, so you got to get it exactly right.                                                  |
| 29:38      | And this is just a nice example of using that clipboard.                                 |
| 29:41      | The clipboard is just kind of a free agent of ways to drop                               |
| 29:47      | information into a text expansion snippet that you may use                               |
| 29:50      | over and over again.                                                                     |
| 29:51      | Maybe you're sending out information to a customer about,                                |
| 29:56      | and it's a different product every time you send the email,                              |
| 29:58      | but you want to send the email, you can have it grab the contents                        |
| 30:01      | of your clipboard.                                                                       |
| 30:02      | That's nice.                                                                             |
| 30:04      | Yes, it is very useful.                                                                  |
| 30:06      | And also one of the things that I have been doing is plain text                          |
| 30:11      | or pasting this as plain text.                                                           |
| 30:14      | So why type semi-colon PC?                                                               |
| 30:16      | It types out my clipboard, but it's plain text,                                          |
| 30:19      | which means that any and all formatting gets removed,                                    |
| 30:22      | but I've still got everything the way it is.                                             |
| 30:24      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 30:25      | Sometimes, and I don't know which applications this is off the                           |
| 30:27      | top of my head.                                                                          |
| 30:28      | I just noticed this happen occasionally.                                                 |
| 30:30      | If I try and do command alt V, command shift alt V, sorry,                               |
| 30:34      | is the correct one to paste without formatting,                                          |
| 30:37      | every so often it goes a little bit wonky.                                               |
| 30:39      | But if I use the plain text snippet with the clipboard inside                            |
| 30:44      | of it and my TextExpander abbreviation, it works.                                       |
| 30:48      | So that saves my bacon every once in a while.                                            |
| 30:51      | And just to make that clear, what's happening is                                     |
| 30:53      | TextExpander can work with either rich text or plain text.                                   |
| 30:57      | So all she's done is made a text expansion snippet that is pasting                       |
| 31:02      | the current contents of the clipboard in plain text.                                     |
| 31:05      | So that necessarily strips any formatting.                                               |
| 31:09      | So you can copy anything and then add,                                                   |
| 31:13      | what's your snippet to paste that, Rose?                                                 |
| 31:16      | It's semicolon PC, which is not very efficient in hindsight.                             |
| 31:20      | The keys are quite spread out.                                                           |
| 31:22      | But it works.                                                                            |
| 31:23      | It does.                                                                                 |
| 31:24      | And it's in my muscle memory now.                                                        |
| 31:26      | And as I type with all 10 fingers, it's not really a problem.                            |
| 31:30      | But related to this, so you can use nested snippets.                                     |
| 31:35      | And this is one which I wish I'd known about earlier.                                    |
| 31:38      | It is a fairly new feature to be fair.                                                   |
| 31:41      | But you can have one snippet included in another snippet.                                |
| 31:45      | And the advantage of this is, say, for example,                                          |
| 31:48      | you've got several different snippets that include your address.                         |
| 31:50      | Maybe one that's got directions to your building,                                        |
| 31:52      | one that's got directions to your office,                                                |
| 31:54      | one for people who are looking to deliver something to you,                              |
| 31:58      | and they've all got your address in.                                                     |
| 31:59      | Well, ideally, all of these will reference one snippet,                                  |
| 32:02      | which is your address snippet.                                                           |
| 32:04      | And then if you ever move, you update your address once,                                 |
| 32:07      | and it's done.                                                                           |
| 32:09      | Because that is so useful.                                                               |
| 32:11      | And especially things like phone numbers or email addresses,                             |
| 32:13      | which are perhaps more likely to change,                                                 |
| 32:15      | then you can do that as well.                                                            |
| 32:18      | And having nested snippets, one snippet inside the other,                                |
| 32:20      | means you update one, and then it just rolls out everywhere.                             |
| 32:24      | And that is definitely a good automation for everybody.                                  |
| 32:28      | Yeah, and one of my favourite script-based snippets                                       |
| 32:32      | is one that I use all the time in email,                                                 |
| 32:34      | where it grabs the name of the recipient.                                                |
| 32:38      | It just uses a little bit of [[AppleScript]] to look at the email                            |
| 32:42      | and whoever the address is, it uses their first name.                                    |
| 32:45      | And that is one snippet.                                                                 |
| 32:47      | But then I use that as a nested snippet in other snippets.                               |
| 32:50      | So I've got, if I type "xhi", it'll say "hi Rose comma".                                   |
| 32:57      | And that part, "Rose", is that nested snippet.                                             |
| 33:00      | But if I type xhello, it'll say hello, Rose.                                             |
| 33:03      | Or if I type xhey, it'll say hey, Rose.                                                  |
| 33:05      | And so it was a way to not have to replace that AppleScript                              |
| 33:11      | in every different iteration of how I want to send an email.                             |
| 33:14      | And if I want to make an adjustment to the AppleScript                                   |
| 33:17      | recently with some listener feedback,                                                    |
| 33:19      | I actually made a few changes to it.                                                     |
| 33:21      | I only had to fix it in one place.                                                       |
| 33:23      | Yes, which is perfect.                                                                   |
| 33:25      | And for people who are there wanting to know                                             |
| 33:28      | what the technical term for this might be called,                                        |
| 33:30      | you could consider it to be a function in programming,                                   |
| 33:32      | which is a thing that you call from lots of different places                             |
| 33:36      | to save you rewriting the same code everywhere.                                          |
| 33:38      | Well, in this case, the code is your text,                                               |
| 33:40      | it doesn't matter, it's still a function.                                                |
| 33:42      | Yeah, I never really thought of it in those terms                                        |
| 33:44      | in TextExpander, but you're absolutely right.                                           |
| 33:46      | That's what it is.                                                                       |
| 33:47      | Especially if you're calling something like your AppleScript                             |
| 33:49      | or as we'll get to you later, some of the JavaScript,                                    |
| 33:51      | it's a function.                                                                         |
| 33:53      | Another thing you can do with a TextExpander                                            |
| 33:56      | that's pretty cool is you can place the cursor                                           |
| 33:59      | after you run the snippet.                                                               |
| 34:01      | So an example of this I use is my file naming snippets.                                  |
| 34:06      | I've got a bunch of them that automatically insert                                       |
| 34:09      | the current date, and then at the end,                                                   |
| 34:12      | it'll say something like MacSparky Expense                                              |
| 34:14      | so [[Hazel]] can do something with it.                                                       |
| 34:16      | But then in the middle is two dashes                                                     |
| 34:18      | where I would put a description.                                                         |
| 34:20      | And I like the description in the middle,                                                |
| 34:22      | because in term, like this gets shared with the accountant,                              |
| 34:25      | I want her to see the date, the description,                                             |
| 34:27      | and then the MacSparky Expense                                                          |
| 34:29      | so she knows what account it's from.                                                     |
| 34:31      | But in order to go and add the description later,                                        |
| 34:35      | you have to place the cursor there.                                                      |
| 34:38      | But you can do that. You can just say,                                                   |
| 34:40      | okay, then move the cursor to this position.                                             |
| 34:42      | And I don't use that often, but when I do,                                               |
| 34:44      | it's very helpful.                                                                       |
| 34:46      | Yes, I can see that being quite useful.                                                  |
| 34:48      | I have several things that I type regularly,                                             |
| 34:51      | and having the cursor positioned afterwards is really good.                              |
| 34:54      | So in general, whenever I type an opening bracket,                                       |
| 34:56      | be that a round bracket, a curly bracket, or a square bracket,                           |
| 34:59      | it will automatically type the closing one for me                                        |
| 35:02      | and put the cursor in the middle.                                                        |
| 35:04      | So I can just keep typing.                                                               |
| 35:06      | This is something that I stole from my IDE.                                              |
| 35:09      | I use PHPStorm at work,                                                                  |
| 35:11      | and an IDE is just a development environment application.                                |
| 35:14      | So it's supposed to make it easier for me to develop.                                    |
| 35:17      | And one of the things that it does,                                                      |
| 35:19      | because you use brackets a lot,                                                          |
| 35:20      | is it automatically closes your brackets for you                                         |
| 35:22      | and puts the cursor back in the middle.                                                  |
| 35:24      | So in all the other applications that I write in that don't do that,                     |
| 35:27      | I have to actually expand to do it for me.                                               |
| 35:29      | Yeah, and like if you wanted to use Markdown a lot,                                      |
| 35:32      | TextExpander is great for Markdown                                                       |
| 35:35      | in terms of creating a snippet that could insert,                                        |
| 35:38      | for instance, the clipboard for a link,                                                  |
| 35:40      | and then place the cursor where you want to type the description.                        |
| 35:43      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 35:45      | These are little things, but it doesn't take long to set this up.                        |
| 35:48      | Like I said, the beauty about text expansion                                              |
| 35:51      | is that it takes almost no effort to set it up,                                          |
| 35:54      | and you can use it every day.                                                            |
| 35:56      | You get rewarded or you get your time back very quickly.                                 |
| 35:59      | Yes, definitely.                                                                         |
| 36:01      | So you use fill-in snippets a lot.                                                       |
| 36:03      | And this is something that I don't use that much                                         |
| 36:05      | because I tend not to have so many emails                                                |
| 36:08      | and things that I send that have got the same text in them.                              |
| 36:11      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 36:13      | So how do you use fill-ins?                                                              |
| 36:15      | I use fill-ins all the time there.                                                       |
| 36:17      | So a fill-in is just like a form letter kind of thing,                                   |
| 36:20      | you know, where I'll say,                                                                |
| 36:22      | Dear, and then have a fill-in field,                                                     |
| 36:25      | and it'll say, well, who are you sending it to?                                          |
| 36:27      | That invoicing thing I was talking about earlier,                                        |
| 36:30      | what it puts the date and the subject line and then hits the tab key.                    |
| 36:33      | The next thing it'll say is hello,                                                       |
| 36:35      | and then I have a fill-in for the client name.                                           |
| 36:38      | And the reason I don't use the AppleScript for that                                     |
| 36:42      | is because I'm doing it on a web form                                                    |
| 36:44      | and that there isn't an AppleScript to address as the web form.                         |
| 36:47      | And sometimes I want to address it to someone else at the company.                       |
| 36:51      | And so there's a basic one-line fill-in                                                  |
| 36:54      | where I can type in the name of the recipient.                                           |
| 36:56      | And then with the fill-ins, it's not...                                                  |
| 36:59      | Then there's at the end, there's a multi-line fill-in                                    |
| 37:02      | where I can type in a status report for the month.                                       |
| 37:05      | So when I send the bill out, they get a little description                               |
| 37:08      | of what I'm doing and what I'm up to and what I think is going on.                       |
| 37:11      | But it's not just for that stuff as well.                                                |
| 37:14      | You can also have optional selections in this fill-in field.                             |
| 37:18      | So like one of the optional selections I use in that snippet is...                       |
| 37:23      | And I usually only use this...                                                           |
| 37:25      | It's basically another sentence that I can just check a box                              |
| 37:28      | and it adds to it.                                                                       |
| 37:29      | If I don't check the box, then it doesn't add the sentence.                              |
| 37:32      | And when I have a new client, I'll say,                                                  |
| 37:34      | if you want me to mail you a copy of this with a stamp,                                  |
| 37:38      | let me know.                                                                             |
| 37:39      | And because most of my clients don't need that                                           |
| 37:41      | and I assume they don't from the beginning,                                              |
| 37:43      | but at the beginning, I'll go ahead and check the box                                    |
| 37:45      | so it adds that field.                                                                   |
| 37:46      | Another one I do when it's a new client is I'll say,                                     |
| 37:49      | if you want me to send these emails to someone else at the company,                      |
| 37:52      | let me know.                                                                             |
| 37:53      | And so I've got these optional selections.                                               |
| 37:56      | I never have to type this stuff.                                                         |
| 37:58      | All I type is new bill in the subject line                                               |
| 38:01      | and it does the whole thing.                                                             |
| 38:02      | It puts the date in, it's the tab key,                                                   |
| 38:04      | gives me the fill-in fields and then it creates the email.                               |
| 38:07      | And so things like that that you do that are repeated,                                   |
| 38:11      | this is super useful.                                                                    |
| 38:13      | I use it also all the time for customer support email.                                   |
| 38:16      | I'm actually surprised with your book release                                            |
| 38:18      | that you're not using a few of these                                                     |
| 38:20      | because it's just a thing that happens                                                   |
| 38:23      | as people buy stuff and they have questions.                                             |
| 38:25      | We have a few of them because my co-author Ryan and I,                                   |
| 38:29      | we both use TextExpander.                                                               |
| 38:30      | We actually use TextExpander a lot writing the book.                                    |
| 38:32      | Whenever I wrote the word task in Scrivener,                                             |
| 38:34      | it automatically replaced it with action for me                                          |
| 38:36      | because we wanted to use the word action rather than task.                               |
| 38:39      | And I specifically have an action group                                                  |
| 38:42      | that only worked in Scrivener for this                                                   |
| 38:44      | because having the word task replaced with action everywhere                             |
| 38:47      | else would be quite confusing for some people.                                           |
| 38:50      | We do use it for support as well.                                                        |
| 38:52      | I've got a couple snippets to say, you know, like,                                       |
| 38:55      | no, this book is not being posted.                                                       |
| 38:57      | It is only a digital book.                                                               |
| 38:59      | And, you know, here's a link to where you can find the downloads                         |
| 39:03      | and stuff like that, which is quite useful for people.                                   |
| 39:06      | Well, I mean, the interesting thing to me                                                |
| 39:08      | is we've been going at this now for a little while                                       |
| 39:10      | and there's all these features that you can use                                          |
| 39:13      | with a more powerful text expansion tool than the built-in one.                          |
| 39:16      | And we haven't even talked about scripting yet,                                          |
| 39:18      | but just looking at the tools we've gone through,                                        |
| 39:21      | if somebody doesn't want to deal with programming                                        |
| 39:24      | or, you know, scripting, there's a lot,                                                  |
| 39:27      | there's a lot of power in just those basic tools                                         |
| 39:30      | and you should be checking that stuff out for sure.                                      |
| 39:33      | But let's talk about that, you know, inserting code                                      |
| 39:36      | through text expansion.                                                                  |
| 39:38      | Yes. Well, that's just it.                                                               |
| 39:40      | You're not really inserting code.                                                        |
| 39:42      | You're using text to generate, manipulate text                                           |
| 39:47      | and then you're inserting the result of that,                                            |
| 39:49      | which is in many ways much better than just inserting code                               |
| 39:52      | because, I mean, I can have an automatic type function,                                  |
| 39:55      | open round bracket, close round bracket, open curly bracket,                             |
| 39:57      | close curly bracket.                                                                     |
| 39:59      | But I don't need anonymous functions a lot                                               |
| 40:04      | and in my case, my development environment                                               |
| 40:07      | will do that for me anyway,                                                              |
| 40:09      | so that wouldn't be a particularly good use case                                         |
| 40:11      | for text expansion, but you can.                                                         |
| 40:13      | What I meant by that was you put code into the snippet itself,                           |
| 40:17      | so it does things for you.                                                               |
| 40:19      | Yeah, and that is where it gets really crazy                                             |
| 40:21      | because you can, and what I love about a TextExpander here                              |
| 40:25      | is that you've got the option of doing this in JavaScript                                |
| 40:27      | or AppleScript and I personally find JavaScript                                         |
| 40:30      | for me is a lot easier for manipulating text                                             |
| 40:32      | because you can get the first character of a string,                                     |
| 40:35      | the last character of a string and it's much easier                                      |
| 40:38      | and I find regular expressions to be easier                                              |
| 40:41      | in JavaScript as well.                                                                   |
| 40:43      | I've never really tried them with AppleScript                                           |
| 40:46      | and regular expressions are really good.                                                 |
| 40:48      | If you've got, for example, something on your keyboard,                                  |
| 40:50      | or on your clipboard, on your keyboard,                                                  |
| 40:52      | and you want to grab, say, for example,                                                  |
| 40:55      | the digits in the invoice number that you've copied out of it.                           |
| 41:00      | Okay, because for whatever reason,                                                       |
| 41:02      | you get the whole field put onto your clipboard.                                         |
| 41:07      | That happens quite frequently with lots of web forms.                                    |
| 41:10      | If you look into the field, it automatically selects everything,                         |
| 41:12      | so instead of trying to select the four or five characters                               |
| 41:15      | of the invoice number, it's easier to just hit copy                                      |
| 41:18      | and have TextExpander grab out those digits for you.                                    |
| 41:21      | So what are some examples of JavaScript uses                                             |
| 41:24      | you're doing in TextExpander now?                                                       |
| 41:26      | It's like just an everyday example.                                                      |
| 41:28      | Well, I've actually had to migrate                                                       |
| 41:30      | some of these unfortunately to other scripts,                                            |
| 41:32      | but for example, the one that I just mentioned,                                          |
| 41:34      | grabbing the invoice number out,                                                         |
| 41:37      | I actually have a couple of these,                                                       |
| 41:38      | one that will also grab the date out                                                     |
| 41:40      | and then reformat the date into my preferred format.                                     |
| 41:43      | So for example, if I have got an American date,                                          |
| 41:45      | then it will just pass a little bit out                                                  |
| 41:47      | and turn that into a European formatted date for me                                      |
| 41:51      | or an ISO formatted date, so year, month, day,                                           |
| 41:53      | instead of month, day, year,                                                             |
| 41:55      | which is just very confusing for me,                                                     |
| 41:57      | and I look at it and I'm always very confused                                            |
| 41:59      | as to why the month and the day are the wrong way around,                                |
| 42:02      | and I frequently get the date and time wrong                                             |
| 42:04      | if I look at it that way, so I have one for that as well.                                |
| 42:07      | I have to admit, I think you guys do it right.                                           |
| 42:10      | I don't understand why we put the numbers together.                                      |
| 42:13      | It does, I think, enable confusion.                                                      |
| 42:16      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 42:17      | And it requires you to use an additional character.                                      |
| 42:20      | You have to put a comma in there, so I don't know.                                       |
| 42:23      | I think you guys might have that one right.                                              |
| 42:25      | Yeah, but it's very useful for doing things like that,                                   |
| 42:28      | because of course you can use,                                                           |
| 42:30      | you can do this in JavaScript or AppleScript,                                            |
| 42:32      | so your AppleScript one of grabbing the context name                                     |
| 42:34      | in the email is perfect,                                                                 |
| 42:36      | but being able to manipulate things,                                                     |
| 42:38      | or for example, turning a comma separated list                                           |
| 42:41      | into a vertical list with line breaks between each item,                                 |
| 42:47      | that's another one that I've got,                                                        |
| 42:49      | and I just use the text expansion,                                                       |
| 42:52      | JavaScript function to split,                                                            |
| 42:54      | and then to combine those back together afterwards.                                      |
| 42:57      | I used to toy with the idea of creating an AppleScript                                   |
| 43:01      | or a JavaScript with TextExpander to fix smart quotes                                   |
| 43:06      | and I think, but I actually figured out a way                                            |
| 43:09      | to do that with keyboard master that made more sense.                                    |
| 43:12      | But there's just a lot you can do with this stuff                                        |
| 43:15      | once you start getting into the automation,                                              |
| 43:17      | and the way it works is rather than having a,                                            |
| 43:21      | when you are in the TextExpander application,                                           |
| 43:25      | rather than saying, when I type this,                                                    |
| 43:27      | I want you to type that,                                                                 |
| 43:29      | you say when I type this, I want you to run certain code,                                |
| 43:31      | and you can select JavaScript or AppleScript,                                            |
| 43:34      | and then you just paste the code into it,                                                |
| 43:36      | and it runs it.                                                                          |
| 43:37      | It's really convenient.                                                                  |
| 43:39      | Yes, it definitely is.                                                                   |
| 43:41      | And you don't need to become a JavaScript or AppleScript person                          |
| 43:46      | to do this.                                                                              |
| 43:47      | I mean, there are a bunch of examples of these scripts                                   |
| 43:49      | are already on the web.                                                                  |
| 43:50      | You can just block and copy them in.                                                     |
| 43:52      | Some of the ones that both Rose and I give away                                          |
| 43:54      | have AppleScript embedded in them.                                                       |
| 43:56      | You don't have to worry about it.                                                        |
| 43:57      | It's just there for you.                                                                 |
| 43:59      | The fact is, once you have an application                                                |
| 44:01      | that's capable of running it,                                                            |
| 44:03      | you can use that code no matter who wrote it.                                            |
| 44:05      | So, it's great.                                                                          |
| 44:06      | But be careful.                                                                          |
| 44:07      | Don't run anything from anybody.                                                         |
| 44:09      | Anytime you run code on your computer,                                                   |
| 44:11      | you never know, right?                                                                   |
| 44:12      | That's true.                                                                             |
| 44:13      | But one of the links that we'll be in the show notes                                     |
| 44:15      | is something from [[Brett Terpstra]],                                                        |
| 44:17      | who, as he was a recent guest,                                                           |
| 44:18      | I think you can probably trust him.                                                      |
| 44:20      | Yeah, he's quite nice.                                                                   |
| 44:21      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 44:22      | It's powerful.                                                                           |
| 44:24      | I mean, the bottom line is,                                                              |
| 44:25      | once you start adding this kind of stuff to text expansion,                              |
| 44:28      | it becomes so much more than just fixing a cellular phone number,                        |
| 44:32      | you know, and it can change the way you use your computer.                               |
| 44:35      | It can save you a great deal of time.                                                    |
| 44:37      | I mean, I'm always reinstalling and resetting TextExpander,                             |
| 44:41      | because like I do screencasts for them occasionally                                      |
| 44:43      | and for whatever reason.                                                                 |
| 44:45      | But, you know, I've looked in there,                                                     |
| 44:47      | and they actually have a little thing that keeps statistics                              |
| 44:49      | about how much time you save.                                                            |
| 44:51      | And I've literally saved months of my life                                               |
| 44:54      | with automatic typing.                                                                   |
| 44:56      | And that's not an exaggeration.                                                          |
| 44:58      | I mean, you know, I've been using the application                                        |
| 45:00      | for a long time and I use it every day.                                                  |
| 45:02      | I mean, not only do I do the advanced stuff we talk about,                               |
| 45:05      | I also type common contract terms                                                        |
| 45:08      | and just so many different things with this application.                                 |
| 45:12      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 45:13      | And it works on iOS too.                                                                 |
| 45:14      | It is great,                                                                             |
| 45:15      | because I spend a lot of my time traveling                                               |
| 45:17      | and the iPad is very small in light.                                                     |
| 45:19      | I do have a nice MacBook Air,                                                            |
| 45:21      | but the iPad is even smaller and even lighter than that.                                 |
| 45:24      | And it's great because you've got TextExpander support                                  |
| 45:28      | in a lot of applications,                                                                |
| 45:30      | which is not something I found with any other                                            |
| 45:32      | text expansion application, unfortunately.                                               |
| 45:34      | But TextExpander has got an API that developers can integrate,                          |
| 45:38      | which means that you don't need to use the TextExpander app                             |
| 45:42      | or the TextExpander software keyboard                                                   |
| 45:44      | to type these things.                                                                    |
| 45:46      | So I do switch to the TextExpander software keyboard occasionally.                      |
| 45:49      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 45:50      | So the way it works on iOS is because of sandboxing,                                     |
| 45:53      | you can't have an application that has access to                                         |
| 45:57      | read your keyboard keystrokes                                                            |
| 45:59      | and allows you to insert text on any application.                                        |
| 46:02      | It's a security thing.                                                                   |
| 46:04      | I kind of wish Apple would make some exceptions for companies                            |
| 46:07      | like Smile because they've clearly established                                           |
| 46:10      | that they're a good player in this community,                                            |
| 46:13      | but they don't.                                                                          |
| 46:14      | So they made the API and some apps have adopted it.                                      |
| 46:17      | For me, this is a great reason.                                                          |
| 46:19      | It's just one more reason why [[Drafts]] is in my dock,                                      |
| 46:22      | to be honest,                                                                            |
| 46:23      | because they've got TextExpander integration.                                           |
| 46:26      | So all those snippets I can use work,                                                    |
| 46:29      | but there is some limitation there too.                                                  |
| 46:31      | You don't get some of the more advanced stuff                                            |
| 46:33      | we've been talking about with the basic API.                                             |
| 46:37      | Some of that stuff,                                                                      |
| 46:38      | you have to go into the TextExpander app on your device.                                |
| 46:42      | A good example for me is like when I do a conference call,                               |
| 46:46      | the TextExpander snippet does a whole bunch of stuff.                                   |
| 46:48      | And I'll talk to about that one maybe later in the show.                                 |
| 46:51      | But I have to activate that in TextExpander,                                            |
| 46:55      | but then I can paste it into an email                                                    |
| 46:57      | or something else very easily.                                                           |
| 46:59      | I really wish that Apple would make it                                                   |
| 47:03      | when you have an attached keyboard to an iMac,                                           |
| 47:06      | that it would allow you to use third-party keyboard tools.                               |
| 47:10      | And TextExpander is the poster child for this.                                          |
| 47:13      | I mean, it seems silly that I've got TextExpander in there.                             |
| 47:16      | I'm in an application that recognises snippets.                                          |
| 47:18      | And I'm sorry,                                                                           |
| 47:19      | well, it will work with applications that recognise snippets                             |
| 47:21      | like Drafts,                                                                             |
| 47:22      | but like if you go into an email application that doesn't,                               |
| 47:25      | wouldn't it be nice if you could type your snippets?                                     |
| 47:28      | Because you can using the TextExpander keyboard,                                        |
| 47:32      | but when you attach a keyboard, all that goes away.                                      |
| 47:35      | And I think that's something they need to fix.                                           |
| 47:37      | Yes, it is.                                                                              |
| 47:38      | And it's very unfortunate that that happens.                                             |
| 47:41      | Though I have to say, occasionally, what I will do is,                                   |
| 47:45      | I will, with the smart keyboard,                                                         |
| 47:47      | I literally physically just detach it by just a few millimeters.                         |
| 47:50      | It's enough to pop up the on-screen keyboard.                                            |
| 47:52      | And then I will type whatever it is I need to type on the software keyboard.             |
| 47:56      | And I'm hoping that when I get my bridge,                                                |
| 47:58      | I'll just be able to press the button to pop up the on-screen keyboard                   |
| 48:01      | and type a few letters.                                                                  |
| 48:03      | But in general, I personally prefer to write in applications                             |
| 48:06      | with TextExpander support like Drafts,                                                  |
| 48:08      | just to save myself a lot of the time and aggravation with,                              |
| 48:12      | why didn't this work?                                                                    |
| 48:13      | Oh, because I'm not in an application that supports it on iOS.                           |
| 48:17      | Well, darn.                                                                              |
| 48:20      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by our awesome friends at Lunar Display.    |
| 48:24      | They are the makers of the only hardware solution                                        |
| 48:27      | that turns your iPad into a wider display for your Mac.                                  |
| 48:30      | That means you'll have a second display that's super portable,                           |
| 48:33      | with basically zero lag and gorgeous image quality.                                      |
| 48:36      | I love my Lunar Display.                                                                 |
| 48:38      | Occasionally, things like the projector flaking out on me at work                        |
| 48:42      | would usually stress me out.                                                             |
| 48:43      | But as it is, I've got my Lunar Display dongle,                                          |
| 48:45      | so I just pop it into my Mac, mirror my display onto my iPad,                            |
| 48:48      | and everybody's watching what I'm doing on my lovely iPad screen                         |
| 48:51      | while I'm showing them what I need to show them on my Mac.                               |
| 48:54      | When I travel, I also use it as a regular second display,                                |
| 48:57      | extending my monitor next to me.                                                         |
| 48:59      | And it's always amazing when people come over and they watch you                         |
| 49:02      | drag a window from your iPad onto your Mac and look at you                               |
| 49:05      | as if you just don't cut some kind of magic,                                             |
| 49:07      | because that's what it feels like.                                                       |
| 49:09      | Setting up extra screens can be fiddly,                                                  |
| 49:12      | but Lunar Display couldn't be easier.                                                    |
| 49:14      | Just plug in this small bit of hardware into your Mac                                    |
| 49:16      | and you're good to go.                                                                   |
| 49:18      | Plus, everything works over Wi-Fi.                                                       |
| 49:20      | However, if you're a busy person,                                                        |
| 49:22      | you might be traveling without a Wi-Fi connection,                                       |
| 49:24      | and that's not a problem.                                                                |
| 49:25      | You can just connect with USB.                                                           |
| 49:27      | It's super simple to set up,                                                             |
| 49:29      | and you'll love that extra screen real estate.                                           |

| 50:12      | Our thanks to Lunar Display for their support                                            |
| 50:14      | of this show and Relay FM.                                                              |
| 50:16      | So, TextExpander isn't the only game in town, though,                                    |
| 50:19      | for advanced text expansion type automation.                                             |
| 50:23      | One of them that certainly comes to mind is Keyboard Maestro.                            |
| 50:26      | Keyboard Maestro is an application.                                                      |
| 50:29      | It's another one that we're going to have to probably                                    |
| 50:31      | give a full show to at some point.                                                       |
| 50:33      | And it's another application that seems to, like,                                        |
| 50:36      | permeate throughout the Automator's content.                                             |
| 50:39      | But one of the triggers this does, you know,                                             |
| 50:42      | and we're talking about text expansion as a trigger,                                     |
| 50:45      | is a typed phrase.                                                                       |
| 50:47      | And that's one of the many ways you can activate                                         |
| 50:50      | Keyboard Maestro to do something.                                                        |
| 50:52      | Type any phrase and something will happen.                                               |
| 50:55      | And Rose, do you use that much as a trigger                                              |
| 50:58      | in Keyboard Maestro?                                                                     |
| 51:00      | I don't necessarily use it with typed things as triggers,                                |
| 51:04      | but for example, I have Keyboard Maestro                                                 |
| 51:07      | renaming documents for me with the sort of thing                                         |
| 51:10      | that you could do with TextExpander,                                                     |
| 51:12      | but I've done it with Keyboard Maestro because then                                      |
| 51:14      | it can duplicate the document before it renames it.                                      |
| 51:16      | If it's got a specific file format,                                                      |
| 51:18      | or if it doesn't have that file format,                                                  |
| 51:20      | it'll pop things up and ask me how it should go                                          |
| 51:23      | about renaming this and things like that,                                                |
| 51:25      | which is very useful.                                                                    |
| 51:27      | And in some ways, it could be considered to be,                                          |
| 51:29      | like, a TextExpander on steroids,                                                        |
| 51:31      | but it's not designed for text expansion per se.                                         |
| 51:35      | It just happens to do that as well as many other things.                                 |
| 51:38      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 51:39      | One of the ways I tried to use type string triggers                                      |
| 51:42      | in Keyboard Maestro was for my setups.                                                   |
| 51:45      | I have a setup when I podcast.                                                           |
| 51:47      | I want certain applications open in certain locations,                                   |
| 51:51      | and I can do all that kind of window management stuff                                    |
| 51:54      | in Keyboard Maestro.                                                                     |
| 51:56      | And for a while, I had set them up like I would just say                                 |
| 51:59      | podcast semicolon.                                                                       |
| 52:01      | And then if I type that word with a semicolon after it,                                  |
| 52:04      | it would automatically close all my apps                                                 |
| 52:07      | and then open the ones I want,                                                           |
| 52:09      | and it would open the ones to the pages I want.                                          |
| 52:12      | So I was doing this kind of stuff like that.                                             |
| 52:15      | But what I found was just typing didn't make sense.                                      |
| 52:18      | If I was just on the desktop, it was weird typing to nothing.                            |
| 52:23      | You know what I mean?                                                                    |
| 52:25      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 52:26      | And sometimes it didn't necessarily work                                                 |
| 52:28      | because I wasn't necessarily in a text field.                                            |
| 52:31      | And then when you can open a Word document and start typing                              |
| 52:34      | something to activate your podcast setup,                                                |
| 52:36      | it just didn't really work for me.                                                       |
| 52:39      | So I don't really have that many that I use.                                             |
| 52:42      | The way I eventually solved that problem by the way                                      |
| 52:44      | in Keyboard Maestro is I just created a palette.                                         |
| 52:47      | And if I hit a, as opposed to a text string, just a keystroke.                           |
| 52:52      | So I hit a certain incantation of keys on my device,                                     |
| 52:57      | like a keyboard shortcut, and then it opens a palette.                                   |
| 53:00      | It opens up all of them.                                                                 |
| 53:01      | Like if I type automators, it opens up, you know,                                        |
| 53:04      | the Quip document to the automators, you know,                                           |
| 53:08      | show that we're working on.                                                              |
| 53:09      | It opens the, it does all the things I needed to do.                                     |
| 53:12      | And doing that off a palette just makes a lot more sense.                                |
| 53:15      | So while Keyboard Maestro does use text as a trigger,                                    |
| 53:19      | and I'm sure we've got some listeners that are probably                                  |
| 53:21      | doing some cool stuff with that.                                                         |
| 53:22      | We'll have to check the forums after the show publishes                                  |
| 53:25      | to see how people are using it.                                                          |
| 53:27      | I don't use that very often as a trigger in Keyboard Maestro,                            |
| 53:31      | just because there's so many other triggers                                              |
| 53:33      | that make more sense to me for most of the stuff                                         |
| 53:35      | I do with that application.                                                              |
| 53:37      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 53:38      | I mean, I do use it for other things.                                                    |
| 53:40      | So for example, if a document SPAs in a specific folder,                                 |
| 53:43      | then Keyboard Maestro might use that to kick it off,                                     |
| 53:46      | like attach it to an email so like an email is an attachment                             |
| 53:49      | and things like that.                                                                    |
| 53:50      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 53:51      | Which is useful for things that I've scanned in on the printer                           |
| 53:53      | at work, because frequently if I scan things in,                                         |
| 53:55      | then it's going to be to email to somebody else.                                         |
| 53:58      | So it's good having that pop up with, you know,                                          |
| 54:01      | automatically in my email.                                                               |
| 54:03      | And then I can use TextExpander to finish it off,                                        |
| 54:07      | which is perfect.                                                                        |
| 54:09      | There's other places.                                                                    |
| 54:11      | [[Alfred]] has text expansion support.                                                       |
| 54:14      | That's a popular launcher application.                                                   |
| 54:17      | We've talked about IDEs throughout the show.                                             |
| 54:21      | And they, you know, it's a programming,                                                  |
| 54:25      | it's a programming environment.                                                          |
| 54:27      | What's the IDE stand for?                                                                |
| 54:28      | Something development environment?                                                       |
| 54:29      | Intelligent development environment.                                                     |
| 54:31      | So it'll do things like auto complete.                                                   |
| 54:33      | So for example, if I've got a variable named MacSparky,                                 |
| 54:36      | then when I type, if I'm using, for example,                                             |
| 54:39      | PHP or another language that starts variables with a dollar sign,                        |
| 54:43      | if I type the dollar sign in an M,                                                       |
| 54:45      | it will suggest MacSparky as one of many things.                                        |
| 54:48      | Yeah.                                                                                    |
| 54:49      | And yeah, it's a very useful way of working.                                             |
| 54:52      | It's kind of like the suggestions,                                                       |
| 54:54      | the auto complete suggestions on iOS,                                                    |
| 54:56      | which are of course another sort of version of text expansion.                           |
| 55:00      | They're not the same, of course.                                                         |
| 55:02      | There's also a type it for me,                                                           |
| 55:04      | which is another text expansion application.                                             |
| 55:06      | I don't really have much experience with it.                                             |
| 55:08      | I don't either, but I keep seeing people recommending it.                                |
| 55:11      | So I would love to hear from you if you're listening to this                             |
| 55:13      | and you're using type it for me,                                                         |
| 55:15      | because I do hear great things about it.                                                 |
| 55:17      | I'm going to go through and play with new applications.                                  |
| 55:20      | So I'd like to hear some uses.                                                           |
| 55:22      | I thought we'd finish up.                                                                |
| 55:23      | I mean, we've talked about a lot of uses                                                 |
| 55:25      | that we have throughout the show,                                                        |
| 55:27      | but I thought it'd be fun just to kind of talk about                                     |
| 55:29      | some additional ways we're automating with text expansion                                |
| 55:32      | as we wrap this up.                                                                      |
| 55:33      | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 55:34      | And I'm going to start with a really simple one.                                         |
| 55:36      | I cannot spell the word separator.                                                       |
| 55:39      | I get the A's and the E's and the O's all wrong all the time.                            |
| 55:44      | So I've created a couple of different TextExpander snippets in my case.                 |
| 55:48      | I should probably move these over to the Mac OS,                                         |
| 55:51      | iOS snippet expansions for those times when I'm typing it,                               |
| 55:54      | and I'm not in an application supported by TextExpander on iOS.                         |
| 55:58      | And I've got all the different ways that I try and spell it in there,                    |
| 56:01      | and they all correct to the correct spelling of separators                               |
| 56:03      | so that I don't look like a complete idiot all the time,                                 |
| 56:06      | just some other time.                                                                    |
| 56:08      | I mean, we all have that list of words that we commonly misspell,                        |
| 56:12      | and that's an obvious candidate for this.                                                |
| 56:15      | I think somewhat related are proper nouns,                                               |
| 56:18      | and maybe you're working on your marketing,                                              |
| 56:23      | you're working on an event, and they have camel case,                                    |
| 56:26      | so they have some weird spelling of it.                                                  |
| 56:28      | Or you deal with the web,                                                                |
| 56:31      | and you've got all these companies you're working with                                   |
| 56:33      | that don't like to use vowels.                                                           |
| 56:35      | So you could use text expansion                                                          |
| 56:40      | to fix all of those spellings problems                                                   |
| 56:42      | and allow it to just make it easier for you to put in.                                   |
| 56:44      | I mean, that's just the most basic,                                                      |
| 56:46      | but there's so much more you can do with it,                                             |
| 56:48      | like a document creation as a lawyer.                                                    |
| 56:50      | There's lots of things I do that do have repeated text in them,                          |
| 56:55      | and I've text expanded almost all of that stuff, the basics,                             |
| 56:59      | so it gives me a starting place.                                                         |
| 57:02      | For instance, if there's a contract between two people,                                  |
| 57:08      | one of the things you almost always want to talk about is,                               |
| 57:11      | hey, if we want to fight each other, where do we do it?                                  |
| 57:13      | They call it the venue clause.                                                           |
| 57:15      | Where do you, what court governs if there's a fight over this contract?                  |
| 57:19      | Well, I've got two or three of those saved as text expansion snippets,                   |
| 57:23      | so when I'm writing a contract,                                                          |
| 57:25      | I will usually start with one of those.                                                  |
| 57:27      | Often I'll have to go in and customise little bits of it,                                |
| 57:29      | but getting it started,                                                                  |
| 57:32      | I save so much time using text expansion for that kind of thing.                         |
| 57:36      | Yes. Another use case is, for example,                                                   |
| 57:40      | I've got phrases I'll use in emails a little at a time.                                  |
| 57:42      | Let me know if there's a problem.                                                        |
| 57:44      | And instead of typing, let me know if there's a problem,                                 |
| 57:48      | I use semicolon lmk in English,                                                          |
| 57:52      | and then I use backslash lmk,                                                            |
| 57:55      | and it will produce the same sentence for me in German,                                  |
| 57:58      | which is very useful at work when I'm trying to write to people in German                |
| 58:01      | and typing, let me know if there's a problem in English.                                 |
| 58:04      | Well, I mean, they'll all understand it.                                                 |
| 58:06      | Everybody I work with is pretty good when they speak fluent English,                     |
| 58:09      | but I'd like to at least give the impression that I speak fluent German,                 |
| 58:13      | which, depending on the day of the week, may not be true.                                |
| 58:16      | And I do this for a lot of different snippets as well,                                   |
| 58:19      | so I've got the same phrases in English and in German,                                   |
| 58:21      | and I just use a different starting trigger                                              |
| 58:24      | to determine which language it should be.                                                |
| 58:27      | One time I heard Merlin Mann say that he does not argue with the internet,               |
| 58:32      | and I love that so much that I made a snippet that says,                                 |
| 58:36      | and mine is X, not me.                                                                   |
| 58:38      | And whenever, you know, I don't get them very often.                                     |
| 58:40      | Occasionally I get an email from someone telling me what a dirty rotten scoundrel I am   |
| 58:44      | for whatever reason. You know, whenever you go on the internet,                          |
| 58:46      | you get that from a complete stranger, and I just type X, not me.                        |
| 58:51      | If I respond at all, I type X, not me.                                                   |
| 58:54      | He says, I'm sorry, I don't argue with the internet.                                     |
| 58:57      | So we've all got those.                                                                  |
| 58:59      | Something that's kind of interesting I've noticed as we've recorded the show             |
| 59:01      | is I always use X as the letter to start it,                                             |
| 59:05      | and you use a semicolon, sounds like.                                                    |
| 59:07      | Yeah, most of the time semicolons occasionally X's for things that I've stolen from you, |
| 59:12      | and then backslashes for things that are starting in German                              |
| 59:15      | that would start with a semicolon in English.                                            |
| 59:17      | Yeah, I like that when you're doing a different language,                                |
| 59:19      | you have a different starter character.                                                  |
| 59:21      | Yeah, but then I have the same snippet, so I don't have to think too hard.               |
| 59:24      | Actually, for some things in German, I have multiple starters,                           |
| 59:28      | so I've got the German equivalent of the abbreviation,                                   |
| 59:31      | just because my brain occasionally remembers that,                                       |
| 59:34      | and I guess what, you use the fill-in snippets in TextExpander                            |
| 59:37      | when I'm using TextExpander for those.                                                    |
| 59:39      | I have a collection of snippets that say thank you in different languages,               |
| 59:44      | so sometimes I hear from a customer and they'll be from a different country.             |
| 59:49      | I like to, I'll just say, it'll say German thanks, you know, and it'll say danke.        |
| 59:55      | Whatever, I've got most of the languages.                                                |
| 59:58      | I shared that library, by the way, at MacSparky.com.                                     |
| 01:00:02   | So feel free to download that and use it.                                                |
| 01:00:06   | I think I've added Klingon.                                                              |
| 01:00:08   | Over the years, I've added a whole bunch of crazy things to it,                          |
| 01:00:11   | but it's fun just to be able to type a phrase in a foreign language                      |
| 01:00:16   | just using a text expansion snippet.                                                     |
| 01:00:19   | But the reason I use the X, I use the semicolon for a long time,                         |
| 01:00:22   | but I switch over to X because I started using the keyboard on iOS a lot                 |
| 01:00:26   | to expand snippets and to get to the semicolon, it's two taps.                           |
| 01:00:30   | And I just didn't want to, like, switch keyboards to trigger a snippet.                  |
| 01:00:33   | So a couple years ago, I switched them all to X.                                         |
| 01:00:37   | Well, I do have a bonus tip for anybody listening who's going,                           |
| 01:00:40   | ah, it's two taps.                                                                       |
| 01:00:41   | If you actually tap on the one, two, three button                                        |
| 01:00:44   | and then just swipe to the semicolon and let go,                                         |
| 01:00:46   | then you switch back to the regular built-in keyboard,                                   |
| 01:00:49   | which is quite useful, but in general, I tend to use it                                  |
| 01:00:52   | like a physical keyboard when I'm typing, typing on iOS                                  |
| 01:00:55   | with something like droughts.                                                            |
| 01:00:57   | So I don't run into that as much because the semicolon's right there.                    |
| 01:01:00   | It's next to the "L"-key.                                                                  |
| 01:01:02   | Yeah, makes sense.                                                                       |
| 01:01:03   | Makes sense.                                                                             |
| 01:01:04   | Yes.                                                                                     |
| 01:01:05   | But I mean, any type of repeated phrases, it's just useful.                              |
| 01:01:09   | I mean, just like throughout a few more, I have them for things like                     |
| 01:01:12   | directions to my house, customers or port emails, whatever.                              |
| 01:01:16   | I mean, anytime you find yourself typing something more than                             |
| 01:01:19   | what's the stuff makes sense with all of the token support                               |
| 01:01:25   | and TextExpander, I've created a whole family of snippets                               |
| 01:01:29   | that I use to document things.                                                           |
| 01:01:31   | Like I talked earlier about my daytime snippet,                                          |
| 01:01:33   | but I also have like a call template when I get a call in                                |
| 01:01:37   | and it doesn't only put the date time in and allows me to put                            |
| 01:01:40   | in who's on the call, what the subject is,                                               |
| 01:01:43   | it's got a line at the bottom says action items.                                         |
| 01:01:45   | So I just like I fire off that snippet into [[Drafts]] when I get on                         |
| 01:01:50   | the call and I fill it in basically while I'm on the call                                |
| 01:01:53   | and when I get off and then I can document and save it.                                  |
| 01:01:56   | And I have a similar one for when I'm in a meeting,                                      |
| 01:01:58   | I have one for conference call that sets up the conference call,                         |
| 01:02:02   | you know, and that that inserts the free conference call dial in                         |
| 01:02:06   | number and it's got a field in there to say how long I estimate                          |
| 01:02:10   | it'll take and what the agenda is just getting that out early                            |
| 01:02:13   | allows you to keep the call, you know, more under control.                               |
| 01:02:17   | Yeah, definitely.                                                                        |
| 01:02:18   | But then I have a separate one that I run while I'm on the call                          |
| 01:02:21   | where I record things just like I was talking about earlier.                             |
| 01:02:24   | We talked in I think was episode 14 about automated journalling.                          |
| 01:02:27   | That's a great place for text expansion.                                                 |
| 01:02:30   | I just all I mean, I was just looking through my library                                 |
| 01:02:33   | as we were getting ready to start the show today.                                        |
| 01:02:35   | I have one in here for sick notes because when my kids get sick,                         |
| 01:02:39   | I've got to send a note to the school.                                                   |
| 01:02:41   | Well, I mean, it sounds silly, but there's only two or three reasons                     |
| 01:02:45   | they're usually sick.                                                                    |
| 01:02:46   | They either have a bad cold or they usually have a stomach flu.                          |
| 01:02:49   | So I've got an option to pick which one it puts the date in.                             |
| 01:02:53   | It creates the whole note for me and it takes a process                                  |
| 01:02:56   | that used to take five minutes and now it turns it into one minute.                      |
| 01:02:59   | And when I don't even remember creating this,                                            |
| 01:03:02   | but I've been using it like for a long time, you know,                                   |
| 01:03:05   | and whenever my kids get sick, that's what I do.                                         |
| 01:03:08   | I have the same thing for me as an adult.                                                |
| 01:03:11   | So when I'm sick, I don't have to, you know,                                             |
| 01:03:13   | like try and formulate an email to say,                                                  |
| 01:03:15   | I'm not well and I'm coming to work today.                                               |
| 01:03:17   | I just fire it off and I'm done.                                                         |
| 01:03:19   | I can go back to bed and sleep and get better.                                           |
| 01:03:22   | I've got one for movie reviews.                                                          |
| 01:03:24   | You know, so when I see a movie, I save it to day one                                    |
| 01:03:27   | and I have a little snippet that I fill in.                                              |
| 01:03:30   | It's kind of fun to go back and look at it in later years                                |
| 01:03:33   | and see what I thought of that movie when I saw it.                                      |
| 01:03:36   | So, you know, just like, just goofy things like that.                                    |
| 01:03:39   | I know you're doing it for emoji as well, right?                                         |
| 01:03:42   | Yeah, or at least I used to.                                                             |
| 01:03:44   | So I used to do colon and then whatever name sort of applied                             |
| 01:03:48   | to the emoji followed by another colon,                                                  |
| 01:03:50   | just like cap you have in Slack and things like that.                                    |
| 01:03:53   | But there's actually a really nice app for this now called Rocket.                       |
| 01:03:56   | And you mentioned this on, I think, the menu bar episode of my power users.              |
| 01:04:00   | But I'm sure we've got some listeners                                                    |
| 01:04:02   | who haven't listened to that episode of my power users.                                  |
| 01:04:05   | I'll put the link in the show notes.                                                     |
| 01:04:06   | But essentially, you type a colon, you start typing                                      |
| 01:04:08   | and it suggests emoji with like a graphical interface,                                   |
| 01:04:11   | which is even better.                                                                    |
| 01:04:12   | But you could, of course, just put the common ones                                       |
| 01:04:15   | into the operating system expansion for you.                                             |
| 01:04:19   | And if you are using something like messages,                                            |
| 01:04:21   | then it will automatically turn things like colon                                        |
| 01:04:25   | closed round bracket into a smiley face for you,                                         |
| 01:04:28   | which is really nice, but not necessarily everything that you want.                      |
| 01:04:33   | Because if you would like a little smiling pile of poop,                                 |
| 01:04:36   | then you need to be able to find that emoji                                              |
| 01:04:38   | and sometimes that one hides.                                                            |
| 01:04:40   | Well, and I guess, you know, we're kind of getting towards the end here.                 |
| 01:04:44   | The point of this show was to explain, number one,                                       |
| 01:04:48   | it's not that hard to get started with automation with text expansion.                   |
| 01:04:52   | And you do need to get something more than the built-in tools.                           |
| 01:04:56   | I think a tool like TextExpander,                                                        |
| 01:04:59   | I know they're an occasional sponsor,                                                    |
| 01:05:01   | whether they were, I mean, something like that                                           |
| 01:05:03   | is a really great tool to get yourself rolling.                                          |
| 01:05:08   | And then once you start making a couple of these,                                        |
| 01:05:11   | you'll find that, you know, like I said,                                                 |
| 01:05:14   | you get the payoff so quickly.                                                           |
| 01:05:16   | Some of the automation we talk about on this show,                                       |
| 01:05:18   | it takes a while to get that time back                                                   |
| 01:05:20   | that you spend creating it.                                                              |
| 01:05:22   | Keyboard maestro is a good example.                                                      |
| 01:05:24   | I mean, it's a great app, but sometimes it takes more involvement                        |
| 01:05:27   | to get the Keyboard Maestro macros working.                                              |
| 01:05:30   | They're powerful, they take longer to develop.                                           |
| 01:05:32   | But with text expansion, it's just so immediate, the return.                             |
| 01:05:37   | And if any of the stuff we talked about today sparks any interest in you,                |
| 01:05:41   | just take some time this weekend and set up a couple of them.                            |
| 01:05:45   | And you'll just be amazed how useful it is once you get it going.                        |
| 01:05:49   | Yes. And if you are going to try TextExpander,                                           |
| 01:05:51   | make sure to check out the shared snippets on their website,                             |
| 01:05:54   | just because there's so many useful ones in there                                        |
| 01:05:56   | and just scrolling through my list right now.                                            |
| 01:05:58   | You can see the names, for example, so whenever you type GitHub,                         |
| 01:06:00   | it's got a capital G and a capital H.                                                    |
| 01:06:02   | Because what case are they using this week?                                              |
| 01:06:05   | Who knows? It depends on the brand.                                                      |
| 01:06:07   | And it's nice to be able to have that automatically fixed for you.                       |
| 01:06:11   | Yeah. And I'm going to get a bunch of mine uploaded to their library                     |
| 01:06:16   | because I started the TE Snippets sub-directory of MacSparky                            |
| 01:06:21   | before they had this.                                                                    |
| 01:06:23   | And I'm going to try and get some upload.                                                |
| 01:06:25   | I don't know if they'll all be up there by the time we publish,                          |
| 01:06:27   | but check that out as well, Rose.                                                        |
| 01:06:29   | Don't you have some of your snippet libraries as well on the web somewhere?              |
| 01:06:33   | Not really, because they all tend to be very personalised to me                          |
| 01:06:36   | and honestly with the German ones, I'm embarrassed.                                      |
| 01:06:38   | Native German speakers like I did, they're probably going to go,                         |
| 01:06:41   | this is all wrong, especially people from Germany,                                       |
| 01:06:43   | because I write in Austrian German nowadays.                                             |
| 01:06:46   | But I will make sure that I've got some links to some of the places                      |
| 01:06:49   | where I've previously stolen this TextExpander snippet groups from.                      |
| 01:06:52   | So I've got one called Letters in Circles,                                               |
| 01:06:55   | and this is really fun. You type three O's and then whatever letter,                     |
| 01:06:58   | and it puts that letter into a circle.                                                   |
| 01:07:01   | And it uses three O's instead of two, because there's words like,                        |
| 01:07:05   | look at a loop, which have two O's in them.                                              |
| 01:07:08   | So yes, it's quite fun.                                                                  |
| 01:07:10   | Some great stuff out there. Let us know how you're using it.                             |
| 01:07:12   | You know, we've got that forum over at talk.automators.fm                                |

| 01:07:22   | Yes. And don't forget, it doesn't matter whether or not you think                        |
| 01:07:26   | you're talented at this stuff, you can do it.                                            |

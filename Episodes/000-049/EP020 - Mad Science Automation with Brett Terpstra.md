| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rose Mary Orchard, and this is The                  |
| 00:06      | Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.              |
| 00:10      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                          |
| 00:11      | Hi, David.                                                                                            |
| 00:12      | How are you today?                                                                                    |
| 00:13      | I am great, and I'm so excited.                                                                       |
| 00:15      | We've got a guest that was on my list for the show as soon as we started the show.                    |
| 00:19      | Welcome Brett Terpstra.                                                                               |
| 00:20      | Hey.                                                                                                  |
| 00:21      | Great to be here.                                                                                     |
| 00:22      | So, Rose, before we get started, we've got a couple of events we should share.                        |
| 00:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:27      | Did you know about the thing called [[WWDC]]?                                                             |
| 00:31      | Have you heard of it before?                                                                          |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:33      | Yeah, the [[Apple]] annual developers conference.                                                         |
| 00:36      | We're pulling you out of Europe and bringing you back to California.                                  |
| 00:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:41      | Somebody made me buy a plane ticket again.                                                            |
| 00:43      | Yeah, you know that you're going to be on my self a bit for a couple of days.                         |
| 00:46      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 00:47      | So, we're going to do two meetups.                                                                    |
| 00:48      | We're going to do one in Orange County before we head up to San Jose.                                 |
| 00:52      | That's either going to be on Friday, May 31st, or Saturday, June 1st.                                 |
| 00:59      | Either one would probably be in the early evening, and it's going to be at a location                 |
| 01:04      | somewhere very near the Irvine Spectrum or the El Toro Y.                                             |
| 01:08      | If you're from Southern California, we determine all locations by freeways.                           |
| 01:14      | We don't know the exact date and location yet, but we're putting a, well, what service                |
| 01:19      | are we going to use for this, Rose?                                                                   |
| 01:21      | I guess we'll use a...                                                                                |
| 01:23      | We are going to be using Eventbrite for this, another free Eventbrite event.                          |
| 01:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:28      | So, it's a free event.                                                                                |
| 01:29      | There's no ticket.                                                                                    |
| 01:30      | It's just we're going to find some place with restaurants and probably outdoor seating,               |
| 01:33      | and just do a Southern California meetup.                                                             |
| 01:35      | It's going to be fun.                                                                                 |
| 01:36      | Rose and I will be there and whoever else wants to come.                                              |
| 01:38      | Like I said, May 31st or June 1st, but if you're interested in that, please go sign                   |
| 01:42      | up and we'll give you further information as we have it.                                              |
| 01:47      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 01:48      | And as I mentioned, this will be available through Eventbrite, so please, it's not that               |
| 01:53      | you need to pay for a ticket, but if you can sign up for a ticket so that we know approximately       |
| 01:57      | how many people are coming and so that we've got a way to contact you just in case anything           |
| 02:00      | does change, that would be really good.                                                               |
| 02:03      | And speaking of events, yeah, let's do one at [[WWDC]].                                                   |
| 02:07      | How about Tuesday lunchtime, David?                                                                   |
| 02:09      | I think that's great.                                                                                 |
| 02:10      | I'm going to be hanging out with you.                                                                 |
| 02:12      | Well, there we go.                                                                                    |
| 02:14      | And we're going to be inviting some people as well.                                                   |
| 02:16      | I know that there are some people from the Omni Group who are planning on visiting San                |
| 02:20      | Jose and they have said that they would be very interested in coming.                                 |
| 02:24      | And I'm sure there are plenty of people in the audience who possibly live around the                  |
| 02:29      | San Jose area or who may be attending [[WWDC]], either in a developer capacity or like David              |
| 02:35      | and myself in a nerd capacity.                                                                        |
| 02:37      | And you are all very welcome.                                                                         |
| 02:39      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 02:40      | So that's going to be Tuesday, June 4th at lunchtime.                                                 |
| 02:45      | And the same thing, we'll have an Eventbrite.                                                         |
| 02:48      | There's no ticket cost, but we want you to sign up for a ticket so we can keep track                  |
| 02:52      | of where we're going to have it in the exact time and any other details as we figure them             |
| 02:58      | out.                                                                                                  |
| 02:59      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 03:00      | And so please sign up.                                                                                |
| 03:01      | And we are looking forward to meeting some more of our listeners and perhaps seeing some              |
| 03:05      | of the listeners that we met in January as well.                                                      |
| 03:07      | And I'm so glad to have you here, Brett.                                                              |
| 03:10      | Brett is on the Mac Power users.                                                                      |
| 03:12      | He's like the Alec Baldwin.                                                                           |
| 03:13      | He just keeps showing up and so much show that we have to drink every time we mention                 |
| 03:18      | his name.                                                                                             |
| 03:19      | But boy, if there's anybody that is a custom automator's guest, it's you, Brett.                      |
| 03:24      | You do some crazy, great stuff on your Mac.                                                           |
| 03:27      | And we're going to focus on the Mac today, but we're going to talk a little bit about                 |
| 03:29      | iOS too.                                                                                              |
| 03:30      | But I can't wait to talk to you a little bit about how you're automating these days.                  |
| 03:34      | So why did it take so long to have me on?                                                             |
| 03:37      | We've been saving you.                                                                                |
| 03:38      | You've been in a little cupboard waiting for us.                                                      |
| 03:42      | We had to make the show worthy of you, you know, I mean, let's be honest, we're just                  |
| 03:45      | getting started.                                                                                      |
| 03:46      | We want to make sure we got the audience and right, the right vibe.                                   |
| 03:50      | Fair enough.                                                                                          |
| 03:51      | And then I know, you know, I know your rules, like, you know, the people listening don't              |
| 03:55      | realise it, but before Brett would agree, I had to send them a bag of only green M&M's.               |
| 04:00      | My writers are crazy.                                                                                 |
| 04:02      | I had to take all the brown ones out and eat them.                                                    |
| 04:05      | And then, you know, and so I sent the M&M's to Brett, man, it's a pain.                               |
| 04:10      | I mean, I think there was a sticker bribe involved as well, right, if I'm remembering                 |
| 04:13      | correctly.                                                                                            |
| 04:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:17      | But anyway, we got you here and that's all that's important.                                          |
| 04:19      | And so, so Brett is over at brettterpstra.com.                                                         |
| 04:24      | He's the developer of multiple applications, maybe even a new one about the time the show             |
| 04:30      | releases we can talk about, but I don't know if we can talk about that yet, but Brett has             |
| 04:34      | something.                                                                                            |
| 04:35      | NDA for right now.                                                                                    |
| 04:36      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 04:37      | He's got something very cool he's working on, so I'm going to tease you with that.                    |
| 04:40      | But also, the thing I've always loved about Brett is he freely share, he's into automation,           |
| 04:45      | he calls himself the mad scientist of the Mac, and that's totally true.                               |
| 04:49      | And he shares this stuff.                                                                             |
| 04:51      | One of my favourite things that you've ever done, Brett, is those markdown tools that                  |
| 04:55      | you do that you can, you know, just add to your Mac and then you can have the services                |
| 05:00      | pack.                                                                                                 |
| 05:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:02      | You know, it's great.                                                                                 |
| 05:03      | So, like, you can go to his website today, we'll put a link in the show notes, but you                |
| 05:06      | download these markdown services, and you can select any text or in a service and perform             |
| 05:11      | markdown on it.                                                                                       |
| 05:12      | It's great.                                                                                           |
| 05:14      | Great stuff.                                                                                          |
| 05:15      | But anyway, we wanted to talk to you about automation, Brett.                                         |
| 05:20      | And I guess the first question is, how did you become a mad scientist?                                |
| 05:24      | Well, I mean, I think automation, like building group Goldberg machines as a kid, like, was           |
| 05:31      | always my favourite thing to do.                                                                       |
| 05:34      | So building these systems to do something and often making them more complicated than                 |
| 05:40      | necessary, it's kind of in my blood.                                                                  |
| 05:43      | My first real computer-based automation was, I was still a PC guy back in the late 90s.               |
| 05:54      | And I got an app called HomeSeer and a bunch of X10 home automation devices.                          |
| 06:03      | And I built the home of the future.                                                                   |
| 06:05      | I used a couple of Audrey's.                                                                          |
| 06:07      | Do you remember the Audrey?                                                                           |
| 06:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 06:09      | I do not know what an Audrey is.                                                                      |
| 06:11      | What is an Audrey?                                                                                    |
| 06:12      | It was a little three-com.                                                                            |
| 06:14      | It's claim to fame was it was in the background of an episode of Friends once.                        |
| 06:18      | But it's a little single-screen device that looks super like it's right out of the Jetsons               |
| 06:24      | and its all curvy.                                                                                     |
| 06:26      | And it had internet access, email.                                                                    |
| 06:30      | I don't even remember what else.                                                                      |
| 06:31      | But basically, and it was a touch screen with a little stylus that stuck in the top.                  |
| 06:36      | And when you had a new message, that stylus would flash green.                                        |
| 06:39      | It was clear acrylic.                                                                                 |
| 06:41      | And it would flash green at the base.                                                                 |
| 06:43      | It was just super futuristic looking.                                                                 |
| 06:45      | But you could hack them to run flash apps and then create your own user interfaces.                   |
| 06:51      | So I had an LCARS, like Star Trek interface on hanging in, two of them hanging in the                |
| 06:57      | hallways.                                                                                             |
| 06:58      | And you could walk up to them and press buttons to turn on and off all the lights in the house.       |
| 07:02      | I had it set up so that when I closed the bathroom door, if it was before 7 AM, it would              |
| 07:08      | at a low volume read me my news, turn on a shower playlist for me.                                    |
| 07:14      | And like this is all before any real other options existed.                                           |
| 07:19      | So it was, and I hacked, I lived in a house that had one of those old like late 80s intercom          |
| 07:25      | systems.                                                                                              |
| 07:27      | And I hacked that so that it was a microphone to my computer.                                         |
| 07:32      | And I could use voice recognition through the intercom to have it do things.                          |
| 07:37      | Did you know that X X 10 started in 1978?                                                             |
| 07:41      | I didn't realise it was that old.                                                                     |
| 07:43      | That is the year I was born.                                                                          |
| 07:45      | Wow.                                                                                                  |
| 07:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:48      | So that's where it all started.                                                                       |
| 07:50      | And then I got to the Mac and and things took off from there.                                         |
| 07:54      | You know, you've got interest and interesting back in because Brett is a designer by training.        |
| 08:02      | What was your degree?                                                                                 |
| 08:03      | And again, I don't want to screw this up.                                                             |
| 08:05      | Interactive multimedia.                                                                               |
| 08:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 08:07      | I got a very diverse, I transferred into art school with basically all of my liberal arts             |
| 08:13      | credits filled.                                                                                       |
| 08:15      | So I got to take core classes from a bunch of different disciplines from 3D and sculpture             |
| 08:20      | to 2D design to figure drawing.                                                                       |
| 08:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 08:25      | I have a wide art background.                                                                         |
| 08:28      | But the thing that makes it interesting is you combine that with highly refined technical             |
| 08:33      | skills in terms of computer programming and so much so, you know, that, you know, you've              |
| 08:39      | got all these successful applications and so you're combining those things, which I                   |
| 08:43      | think is always very interesting.                                                                     |
| 08:45      | But at the same time, like we had John Siracusa on last month and, you know, his thing was            |
| 08:51      | he's a programmer.                                                                                    |
| 08:52      | So, you know, traditional automation stuff really doesn't light him up that much because              |
| 08:57      | he's used to just, you know, going into the system and making changes like a programmer               |
| 09:02      | would.                                                                                                |
| 09:03      | But but you're kind of like, you're kind of down more my vein in the way that you go                  |
| 09:08      | through and you're using the tools, the automation tools to put this stuff together.                  |
| 09:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 09:13      | And I do a lot, a lot of my automation is hard to share because it is system level requires           |
| 09:20      | digging into terminal.                                                                                |
| 09:21      | And then I use more foreground apps like, you know, [[Keyboard Maestro]] to trigger shell                 |
| 09:28      | scripts and things that are doing things that most of those automation, automation apps               |
| 09:32      | can't.                                                                                                |
| 09:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 09:34      | And that's been my big block with getting into iOS automation is the front end is pretty              |
| 09:40      | well fleshed out with shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 09:42      | You know, yeah, knee workflow, but you can't get to the real the easy way to do things                |
| 09:49      | the way I always have on the Mac.                                                                     |
| 09:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 09:52      | I mean, you don't have a terminal then on your your phone and your iPad and or really                 |
| 09:56      | any truly powerful scripting language as they are and you don't have that base level                  |
| 10:01      | Apple event that you have on the Mac that it allows you to once you can address that                  |
| 10:06      | stuff you can do almost anything.                                                                     |
| 10:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 10:09      | So once you got started on the Mac, where, you know, where did you, where did you go?                 |
| 10:14      | So as I was dipping my toes into the Mac, I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't consider myself                |
| 10:20      | a programmer at the time.                                                                             |
| 10:21      | I got my first PC junior at the age of six, and I'd been actually programming and all                 |
| 10:28      | of my stuff in HomeSeer was done in visual basic script.                                              |
| 10:32      | And yeah, I was a programmer, but I didn't consider myself a programmer.                              |
| 10:36      | I was, I got a Mac to when I opened a marketing firm.                                                 |
| 10:41      | And one of the first things, it was about the time that Twitter had become a thing.                   |
| 10:47      | And so there was Twitter and Facebook, and then there were all of the Twitter clones                  |
| 10:53      | that went by the wayside as Twitter gained popularity, but I don't even remember the                  |
| 10:57      | names of half of them, Jaiku, et cetera.                                                             |
| 11:01      | And so I was exploring social media and I wanted to be able to use them all, but not                  |
| 11:07      | have to log into every site to say what I was doing.                                                  |
| 11:11      | So I broke the DIY principles, do not repeat yourself.                                                |
| 11:16      | And I wrote an app in [[AppleScript]] called Moodblast that would take one status update                 |
| 11:23      | and send it to 12 different services.                                                                 |
| 11:25      | Now, had you had any experience with [[AppleScript]] at that point?                                      |
| 11:28      | No, that was my learning [[AppleScript]].                                                                |
| 11:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 11:33      | That's not a small project to start with.                                                             |
| 11:35      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 11:36      | And there was a lot of do shell script involved.                                                      |
| 11:39      | Yeah, if that works, right?                                                                           |
| 11:41      | So that's what counts.                                                                                |
| 11:42      | Well, you almost had to to make HTTP post requests with various headers.                              |
| 11:51      | And that morphed into an Objective C bridged [[AppleScript]] application so I could put an               |
| 11:57      | interface on it and that was my first like real success in the world.                                 |
| 12:01      | My blog went from 10 hit today to a thousand hit today as I built up that audience for                |
| 12:08      | this stuff I was I was making.                                                                        |
| 12:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:11      | Then that was I'm I'm highly encouraged by public response.                                           |
| 12:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:17      | I'm a sucker for likes.                                                                               |
| 12:20      | So when I got positive feedback in comments and and then moving on to writing for two                 |
| 12:26      | and everything, it just constantly drove me to not only automate, which I would do anyway,            |
| 12:34      | but to automate in ways that I could share and to learn things like [[AppleScript]] that                 |
| 12:40      | more people could easily grasp.                                                                       |
| 12:42      | People write me often say, well, I want to learn [[AppleScript]].                                        |
| 12:45      | What do I do?                                                                                         |
| 12:46      | And, you know, I usually say, well, buy salsa going in his book because the guy is he's               |
| 12:50      | the guy.                                                                                              |
| 12:51      | But I think the real answer to that question is find a problem that you can solve with                |
| 12:55      | [[AppleScript]] and then make an [[AppleScript]] to solve the problem because learning that                 |
| 13:00      | stuff in the abstract doesn't it just doesn't gel at least for me.                                    |
| 13:04      | I have to try and be fixing something in order for me to really get it.                               |
| 13:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:09      | Well, I need a problem to solve.                                                                      |
| 13:11      | And then it's easy for me to keep searching and digging until I find the way to solve                 |
| 13:15      | it and in the process, picking up all the tools that of course, there are some things                 |
| 13:19      | that you can't solve with [[AppleScript]], which is something of a danger.                               |
| 13:22      | I was there the other day trying to figure out how to turn a CSV, which was not a CSV                 |
| 13:28      | but a semicolon separated file into a particular format of XML with shortcuts.                        |
| 13:35      | And after a good half an hour, I decided, you know what, I'm just going to use Python.                |
| 13:38      | I was just going to say that's where you shell out to Python.                                         |
| 13:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:42      | So I wrote a Python script for it in the end because of course not everything can be solved           |
| 13:45      | in every language.                                                                                    |
| 13:46      | And sometimes you do make it a little bit more difficult for yourself to do it in other               |
| 13:50      | languages or not on impossible.                                                                       |
| 13:52      | But that said, [[AppleScript]], because it does do Apple events is extremely powerful.                   |
| 13:57      | So there are less things that [[AppleScript]] can't do compared to something like shortcuts.             |
| 14:03      | Powerful yet frustrating in its inconsistency.                                                        |
| 14:07      | At least there's no [[JavaScript]] automation on macOS.                                                   |
| 14:10      | I went to the conference that [[Sal Soghoian]] go and put on, I forget what it was called.                       |
| 14:16      | [[CMD-D Conference\|CMD-D]].                                                                                            |
| 14:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 14:18      | I went to [[CMD-D Conference\|CMD-D]].                                                                                  |
| 14:19      | Last minute edition.                                                                                  |
| 14:24      | But his major focus was on [[JavaScript]] for automation and especially on Omni's new kind                |
| 14:33      | of interface language that they had created.                                                          |
| 14:36      | And it was impressive yet also when you apply the inconsistency of [[AppleScript]] to the less           |
| 14:48      | natural language of [[JavaScript]], it can take me twice as long to write something in [[JXA]]                |
| 14:57      | as it can to write it in [[AppleScript]].                                                                |
| 15:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 15:01      | It depends.                                                                                           |
| 15:02      | Because the [[JavaScript]] built into macOS is supposed to be the replacement for [[AppleScript]].           |
| 15:06      | That is extremely weird in some cases.                                                                |
| 15:08      | And in some cases, the [[JavaScript]] doesn't do what the equivalent [[AppleScript]] command                 |
| 15:11      | does because it's missing a trigger or something to talk to something else.                           |
| 15:15      | To get the contents of a web page using just [[JavaScript]], you have to use Objective C bridging         |
| 15:24      | and use those very verbose get contents of URL with encoding type methods.                            |
| 15:32      | And it is, it's a mess.                                                                               |
| 15:34      | I don't, I don't love it.                                                                             |
| 15:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 15:36      | And I just want to pull out of the weeds for a minute.                                                |
| 15:38      | So the [[JavaScript]] that we're talking about is that the variant that the Omni group is                 |
| 15:42      | made that allows you to automate their applications.                                                  |
| 15:46      | And the advantage of it is that it works across platforms.                                            |
| 15:49      | So where [[AppleScript]] only allows you to create something for the Mac, this [[JXA]] allows you            |
| 15:55      | to create something for both the iOS and the Mac.                                                     |
| 15:59      | So if you're working on both platforms, it's very helpful.                                            |
| 16:02      | I think the really underlying problem is that doesn't need to come from Omni, it needs to             |
| 16:06      | come from [[Apple]].                                                                                      |
| 16:07      | And, and I don't know if we ever will see something.                                                  |
| 16:11      | I don't know if [[Apple]] cares enough to develop something like [[AppleScript]] across both platforms.      |
| 16:15      | Well, I hear they have this automation team working with the Siri people who are really,              |
| 16:21      | you know, into this kind of thing.                                                                    |
| 16:22      | So maybe, maybe the shortcuts guys will get their hands on this.                                      |
| 16:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 16:26      | There was a lot of fear for everyone when Sal was removed from [[Apple]].                                 |
| 16:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 16:31      | Everyone assumed, oh, [[Apple]] just doesn't care about automation, but then with the acquisition         |
| 16:36      | of workflow and their stunning ability not to ruin it, yeah, my faith was restored.                   |
| 16:44      | I think at least for iOS, well, not only have they not ruined it, they've improved it.                |
| 16:49      | I mean, workflow had limitations that Siri shortcuts do not and that they've continued                |
| 16:55      | to release updates and system access.                                                                 |
| 16:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 16:59      | No shortcuts is amazing.                                                                              |
| 17:00      | I also think though, the shortcuts is, you know, if we're looking at the stuff on a spectrum,         |
| 17:04      | this is never going to run as deep as [[AppleScript]] and certainly not as deep as any sort              |
| 17:10      | of shell scripting can do.                                                                            |
| 17:12      | No, probably not.                                                                                     |
| 17:14      | That's also part of like on a Mac with the idea of a desktop with multiple applications               |
| 17:19      | running and communication between those applications being more of a central focus, bridging the      |
| 17:26      | more app as desktop idea of iOS.                                                                      |
| 17:31      | It's a different concept that requires a different approach and I think shortcuts is really tackling  |
| 17:37      | that in a smart way and I see the more apps that add shortcut actions, the more interactivity         |
| 17:46      | we'll be able to do without the hassle of [[JavaScript]].                                                 |
| 17:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 17:51      | And I think that's the path [[Apple]] sees too.                                                           |
| 17:53      | I mean, we were just talking a few episodes ago about, you know, what's going to happen               |
| 17:57      | next in one idea being floated is what if Siri shortcuts finds its way to the Mac and                 |
| 18:03      | that would be great, but it's definitely not going to be as powerful as what like you're              |
| 18:08      | doing on the Mac with your scripting.                                                                 |
| 18:11      | It's just not going to go as deep in my opinion.                                                      |
| 18:13      | So can we skip ahead to that question?                                                                |
| 18:16      | What's next?                                                                                          |
| 18:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 18:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 18:19      | Honestly, Automator is, it's powerful but limited.                                                    |
| 18:23      | And if they added simple things like if then and for loops, the way that you can do in                |
| 18:31      | shortcuts, if they brought even some of the workflow features from shortcuts to the Mac,              |
| 18:39      | Automator could be like the answer and that to me is what's next.                                     |
| 18:46      | Automator's always felt to me like, you know, everything like when someone's building a               |
| 18:49      | muscle car, I feel like there's the frame and a really big engine block, but it's missing             |
| 18:55      | a lot of parts.                                                                                       |
| 18:56      | Like it never got the rest of it built.                                                               |
| 18:59      | No catalytic converter.                                                                               |
| 19:00      | Like what are you supposed to do?                                                                     |
| 19:02      | Well, not even doors.                                                                                 |
| 19:04      | I mean, it's got some like application, but like involvement, like you can create an email            |
| 19:10      | and there's limited things you can do.                                                                |
| 19:11      | But when you compare that to how deep and how wide Siri shortcuts runs on iOS, Automator              |
| 19:18      | should have been that.                                                                                |
| 19:20      | Well, and it can be like any app could add actions to perform much deeper automation                  |
| 19:30      | and most apps ignore Automator completely.                                                            |
| 19:33      | And those that do add it usually add it for just a couple of features of the app.                     |
| 19:40      | Have you heard of [[Retrobatch]]?                                                                        |
| 19:42      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 19:43      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 19:44      | It's a new app from Gus Mueller, the guy who makes Acorn [[Flying Meat Software\|Flying Meat]].                                   |
| 19:48      | Well, is that that's the image process?                                                               |
| 19:50      | Yeah, it's a node based image processing app where you can instead of just a linear list              |
| 19:57      | of automations, a la Automator, you have like a concept map type thing where you drag nodes           |
| 20:06      | onto workspace and then connections between them and images can be passed in like three               |
| 20:12      | different directions at once and have different processing and output different file names.           |
| 20:17      | And then you can incorporate those into Automator, Automator can trigger so you can have an Automator |
| 20:25      | script that say grabs an image from the web, runs it through a [[Retrobatch]] to resize and              |
| 20:31      | water market and then saves it to a specific place or even, you know, multiple places.                |
| 20:39      | That kind of thing, apps that allow that kind of extensibility and extension of Automator             |
| 20:47      | excite me a lot.                                                                                      |
| 20:49      | Yeah, totally.                                                                                        |
| 20:50      | That's great.                                                                                         |
| 20:51      | I mean, just looking at Automator, for example, the new calendar event, compare that with             |
| 20:54      | shortcuts.                                                                                            |
| 20:55      | I can't even use a variable to set the start and the end time of the new calendar event               |
| 20:59      | in Automator.                                                                                         |
| 21:00      | So that, you know, just being able to amp that up would probably significantly increase               |
| 21:06      | the ability of people to use it because otherwise, how do I ask for a date every time it's good       |
| 21:11      | create an event every single time at the exact time that's in there, otherwise, I'm                   |
| 21:16      | going to have to modify this every time and that's not the thing that people want to do.              |
| 21:20      | That's not really called automation at that point.                                                    |
| 21:22      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 21:23      | That's very manual.                                                                                   |
| 21:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 21:26      | [[Retrobatch]], looking at, I'm looking at it literally right next to my [[Audio Hijack]]                   |
| 21:30      | pro.                                                                                                  |
| 21:31      | It looks, looks very similar, you know, the uh.                                                       |
| 21:35      | Well, that's a good sign.                                                                             |
| 21:36      | I like [[Audio Hijack]].                                                                                  |
| 21:37      | It's got, it's got like a workflow where you pull units and it's, it's cool.                          |
| 21:42      | I'm going to definitely give it a shot.                                                               |
| 21:44      | I have a [[Retrobatch]] droplet that I can create using a template in my image editor in Affinity        |
| 21:51      | Photo.                                                                                                |
| 21:52      | I can create a header image for a blog post, run it through this droplet and it will resize           |
| 21:58      | for all social media sizes and save with the file names that my HT access file uses to                |
| 22:03      | serve images to Twitter and Facebook and do that all with basically I design once and                 |
| 22:10      | drop out and get five different images ready to go to my blog.                                        |
| 22:14      | That is amazing.                                                                                      |
| 22:15      | And I did not realise, obviously in hindsight, it's obvious to me that the HT access file             |
| 22:20      | for people not familiar is the thing that your server uses to tell things what you can                |
| 22:25      | get at and how to get at them.                                                                        |
| 22:27      | And I've never thought of using it to tell services to get different images.                          |
| 22:33      | It's genius.                                                                                          |
| 22:34      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 22:35      | Well, I use a, I use a consistent file name scheme that HT access can match and then fall             |
| 22:39      | back.                                                                                                 |
| 22:40      | If I don't provide like a Twitter size image, it'll fall back to the Facebook one and continually     |
| 22:45      | until it gets by.                                                                                     |
| 22:46      | If I only provide one header image, it'll figure out how to use that for everything.                  |
| 22:50      | This is genius.                                                                                       |
| 22:51      | Please, please, please.                                                                               |
| 22:52      | If you can put like, or at least send me the documents and I'll, I'll have, I'll incorporate          |
| 22:56      | that into a post.                                                                                     |
| 22:57      | I have a meaning to write about it, but.                                                              |
| 22:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 22:59      | Well, now you have a challenge to do so by the time this episode releases.                            |
| 23:02      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 23:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 23:04      | Well, you know, but this, this is automation.                                                         |
| 23:06      | I mean, when you look at [[Retrobatch]], what it does, it allows you to drop an image in                 |
| 23:11      | one end of the nap and it spits out multiple images out the other end that are formatted              |
| 23:17      | and doing a bunch of things that we used to do by hand.                                               |
| 23:21      | And there's nothing, you know, I, I'm a big proponent of what I call software based                   |
| 23:25      | automation because I don't have a lot of time to make this stuff work.                                |
| 23:30      | And I do find that when I use software based automation in a lot of ways, it, it's more               |
| 23:35      | consistent.                                                                                           |
| 23:36      | It doesn't break as often, but this is something where you download this app, you set it up.          |
| 23:40      | And if you're consistently making changes to images, the problem just got solved for                  |
| 23:46      | you.                                                                                                  |
| 23:49      | This episode of the automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                       |
| 23:54      | We can probably all hold our hands up and admit that we think cyber crime is something                |
| 23:58      | that happens to other people because who would want your data, right?                                 |
| 24:02      | Well, the bad news is stealing data from people like you and me using public Wi-Fi is one             |
| 24:07      | of the simplest ways for hackers to make money.                                                       |
| 24:10      | If you leave your internet connection unencrypted, your passwords and credit card numbers are         |
| 24:15      | vulnerable, but there's something you can do to protect yourself from cyber criminals.                |
| 24:20      | And that is to start using ExpressVPN.                                                                |
| 24:23      | ExpressVPN works by securing and anonymising your internet browsing.                                  |
| 24:28      | It accepts your data and hides your public IP address with easy to use apps that run                  |
| 24:32      | seamlessly in the background of your device.                                                          |
| 24:35      | You can turn on ExpressVPN protection with just one click.                                            |
| 24:38      | It's super simple.                                                                                    |
| 24:39      | You open the app, you push one button, you're secure.                                                 |
| 24:42      | Then you're free to safely serve or use public Wi-Fi without being snooped on or having               |
| 24:47      | your personal data stolen.                                                                            |
| 24:50      | ExpressVPN is rated the number one VPN service by tech radar.                                         |
| 24:54      | It even comes with a 30 day money back guarantee.                                                     |
| 24:58      | I'm a believer in VPN services and I've been using ExpressVPN now for several months and              |
| 25:03      | have been really happy with the service.                                                              |
| 25:06      | Every time I go to Starbucks or get in an airport, anytime frankly I want to be anywhere              |
| 25:11      | outside of my home, I use ExpressVPN to secure my connection.                                         |
| 25:16      | Just the other day I was at a local university and I saw on the Wi-Fi list free university            |
| 25:21      | Wi-Fi.                                                                                                |
| 25:22      | I asked a friend who was a teacher there and he said, no, that's not the actual university            |
| 25:26      | Wi-Fi.                                                                                                |
| 25:27      | I can only imagine what kind of data was being stolen from the people that were logging               |
| 25:31      | into that quote unquote free Wi-Fi.                                                                   |
| 25:34      | It wasn't a problem for me though.                                                                    |
| 25:36      | I just turned on ExpressVPN and got back to work.                                                     |
| 25:39      | Having an easy to use secure VPN service gives you a great deal of peace of mind whenever             |
| 25:44      | you want to access the internet out in the wild.                                                      |
| 25:47      | For less than $7 a month, you too can get that same ExpressVPN protection that I have.                |
| 25:53      | If you ever use public Wi-Fi and want to keep the bad guys away from your data, you need              |
| 25:58      | ExpressVPN.                                                                                           |

| 26:25      | Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of automators and all of RelayFM.                          |
| 26:31      | You know, you and I did a book together called, you see, Mac Tips Volume 2 and I have found           |
| 26:37      | uses for it when I was writing that book.                                                             |
| 26:39      | I thought it was dumb and then I did a bunch of stuff and I use it mainly for music.                  |
| 26:45      | Yeah, we did that book.                                                                               |
| 26:47      | I found it intriguing.                                                                                |
| 26:49      | I found some cool tricks to do.                                                                       |
| 26:51      | Just never made it a daily part.                                                                      |
| 26:55      | Like I love on iOS being able to assign a phrase to perform a shortcut that to me is the best         |
| 27:03      | feature of shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 27:06      | But that on the Mac, I just, I haven't found that much use for it.                                    |
| 27:10      | I'm very keyboard centric.                                                                            |
| 27:12      | Well, we kind of, we're kind of stuck because my experience, the Siri shortcuts triggered             |
| 27:18      | by the HomePod are very inconsistent, at least for me.                                                |
| 27:21      | Maybe it's my voice.                                                                                  |
| 27:22      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 27:23      | But I just, I can get them to work fine on the phone and they work on the HomePod like                |
| 27:28      | maybe 20% of the time, you know, which is not enough to make it worth doing.                          |
| 27:33      | Like it doesn't recognise it or it fails to run it.                                                   |
| 27:37      | I'll give the command and then it'll start playing Beyonce.                                           |
| 27:41      | And I'm like, I don't know what just happened.                                                        |
| 27:43      | Was the command play Beyonce?                                                                         |
| 27:45      | No, the command was like turn the lights on, you know.                                                |
| 27:49      | I use my HomePod for [[HomeKit]] and it's great.                                                          |
| 27:53      | My watch has some issues like that, but it'll usually be, I'll tap you when I'm ready.                |
| 27:59      | And then I'll wait, you know, 15 seconds for my light to come on.                                     |
| 28:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:04      | That's the standard watch response yet.                                                               |
| 28:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:08      | It's frustrating because like the stuff works great.                                                  |
| 28:11      | Like I've been playing with timers lately and I can set a timer with my phone using                   |
| 28:17      | Siri voice commands.                                                                                  |
| 28:18      | No problem.                                                                                           |
| 28:19      | And then I go to set it with the HomePod and it just either doesn't trigger or it sets                |
| 28:25      | a different timer.                                                                                    |
| 28:26      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 28:27      | There's something going on between the HomePod and the phone where it's just not consistent           |
| 28:31      | for me.                                                                                               |
| 28:32      | I think you may need to try resetting your HomePod, David, because, I mean, they don't                |
| 28:36      | even sell them in Ulster and I managed to get one and it works great.                                 |
| 28:40      | Granted, I speak to it in English because why would I speak in a second language when                 |
| 28:45      | I'm talking to one of my devices?                                                                     |
| 28:47      | Well, that explains it.                                                                               |
| 28:48      | I only speak to my HomePod in Swahili.                                                                |
| 28:50      | So that's probably the issue.                                                                         |
| 28:52      | There we go.                                                                                          |
| 28:53      | There's your problem.                                                                                 |
| 28:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:55      | I mean, yeah.                                                                                         |
| 28:56      | Occasionally, you might lose this internet connection.                                                |
| 28:58      | You have to unplug it, wait five minutes and plug it back in and then it's perfectly                  |
| 29:01      | happy again.                                                                                          |
| 29:02      | Oh, technology.                                                                                       |
| 29:03      | Oh, yes.                                                                                              |
| 29:04      | But we love it anyway.                                                                                |
| 29:06      | Actually, at one point, I tried to automate.                                                          |
| 29:09      | I had a script that would run and use ping to determine whether the internet was connected            |
| 29:15      | or not.                                                                                               |
| 29:16      | And if the internet was down for a 30 second period, it would trigger a power supply that             |
| 29:22      | would reboot the router and the modem.                                                                |
| 29:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 29:25      | It didn't work great because I need my modem to come up before the router connects.                   |
| 29:31      | And then I got into sequencing and realised this is more complicated than just unplugging             |
| 29:37      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 29:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 29:39      | Years ago on Mac Paris, just Katie Floyd was having a problem with her router setup.                  |
| 29:44      | And so she put a, I forget which brand she's, but she's one of those remote plugs on the              |
| 29:50      | hub.                                                                                                  |
| 29:52      | And she would just literally from wherever she was sitting, just turn off the power to                |
| 29:56      | it and then cycle it back on.                                                                         |
| 29:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 29:58      | So if you're supposed to turn it off, then turn on first the cable modem, and then the                |
| 30:04      | router, you're supposed to do it in a certain order, but I don't think it matters.                    |
| 30:08      | I have found that on occasion it matters.                                                             |
| 30:11      | But that's it.                                                                                        |
| 30:12      | Oh.                                                                                                   |
| 30:13      | For her, I guess she didn't think it mattered.                                                        |
| 30:14      | In my case, it does not matter.                                                                       |
| 30:15      | Sorry, what?                                                                                          |
| 30:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 30:17      | Well, in my case, it doesn't matter because it's an all in one.                                       |
| 30:21      | So with that, there's an automation solution for that problem.                                        |
| 30:25      | That is perfect.                                                                                      |
| 30:26      | Just buy an all in one.                                                                               |
| 30:27      | There you go.                                                                                         |
| 30:28      | It'll do it by itself.                                                                                |
| 30:30      | So Brett, what are you, what's on your mind lately in terms of automation?                            |
| 30:33      | What are you working on these days?                                                                   |
| 30:35      | As of very recently, most of my automation has been kind of along the lines of what we                |
| 30:41      | were talking about with the HD access file.                                                           |
| 30:43      | Like I just made it so that if I include a link to an affiliate [[Amazon]] product, it automatically      |
| 30:51      | adds the disclaimer that [[Amazon]] requests to the bottom of my post.                                    |
| 30:58      | So I don't have to constantly be like, oh, I used an affiliate link.                                  |
| 31:02      | I better add the disclaimer.                                                                          |
| 31:04      | It just automates based on what I've already done, things that, you know, I'm going to                |
| 31:09      | do anyway.                                                                                            |
| 31:10      | They're not things I can automate, but then based on those things, automation happens.                |
| 31:15      | And then my like tag filing system, you want to hear about my flick button?                           |
| 31:20      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 31:21      | I would love to hear about it.                                                                        |
| 31:22      | Do you know, do you know what a flick button is?                                                      |
| 31:25      | I do.                                                                                                 |
| 31:26      | I'm guessing David might not.                                                                         |
| 31:27      | I do not.                                                                                             |
| 31:28      | It's a little single button about maybe an inch and a quarter in diameter.                            |
| 31:37      | And you can stick them to surfaces.                                                                   |
| 31:41      | And then they have a press, a long press and a double click.                                          |
| 31:46      | And you can using an iOS app, then define what it does.                                               |
| 31:51      | And if you get the hub, you can have it automate without the need for your phone to be present.       |
| 31:56      | And so under the lip of my desk, when I sit down in my chair, a single press turns the                |
| 32:03      | lights on and off.                                                                                    |
| 32:05      | And a long press is my boss key.                                                                      |
| 32:09      | A long press actually triggers a script on my computer that shuts down my most distracting            |
| 32:15      | apps.                                                                                                 |
| 32:16      | I'm ADD.                                                                                              |
| 32:17      | I can easily go down rabbit holes that have nothing to do with what I'm working on.                   |
| 32:23      | So I don't have a boss that I need to hide anything from.                                             |
| 32:27      | I just need to hide stuff from myself.                                                                |
| 32:29      | So when I find myself getting distracted, I can press and hold that button.                           |
| 32:33      | And all of my social media apps will quit.                                                            |
| 32:36      | My news app will quit web pages open to like social media sites will quit.                            |
| 32:43      | So that's my, I think that's my latest somewhat humorous, but actually very useful automation.        |
| 32:50      | That is genius.                                                                                       |
| 32:51      | Flick is F-L-I-C.                                                                                     |
| 32:52      | Correct.                                                                                              |
| 32:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 32:54      | This looks like it's something that must have started life as like a Kickstarter, right?              |
| 32:58      | Absolutely.                                                                                           |
| 32:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:00      | And most of my, most of my switches are from backing a quick Kickstarter project.                     |
| 33:03      | I remember currently this has Zapier integration as well.                                             |
| 33:06      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 33:07      | Which is pretty awesome.                                                                              |
| 33:08      | I have some Logitech pop buttons, which like your flick button do the one press, the two              |
| 33:13      | press or the press and hold, but those are for like home kid or Phillips Hue and stuff                |
| 33:20      | like that.                                                                                            |
| 33:21      | Well, and this, these integrate directly with like the Hue app and stuff too.                         |
| 33:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:25      | That's nice.                                                                                          |
| 33:26      | I just make it complicated.                                                                           |
| 33:28      | Why not?                                                                                              |
| 33:29      | Ah, this is tempting, man.                                                                            |
| 33:31      | I'm looking at it.                                                                                    |
| 33:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:33      | So you get three of them.                                                                             |
| 33:34      | They're not cheap though.                                                                             |
| 33:35      | It's $85 or three of them love to think about it.                                                     |
| 33:38      | So now you, with the app, what can you, I understand you can go directly to your, your                |
| 33:45      | internet of things home.                                                                              |
| 33:47      | It can ping a URL, which is how I do most of my automation that it can't do.                          |
| 33:53      | I create little APIs, little local web servers that I can ping to trigger things.                     |
| 33:59      | Let's open the app though.                                                                            |
| 34:00      | I can tell you real quick, maybe not real quick.                                                      |
| 34:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:05      | It's okay, I'm currently searching on [[Amazon]] to see if they have them in [[Amazon]], in Germany.          |
| 34:11      | So it can control [[Chromecast]], [[Logitech Harmony\|Harmony Hub]], [[IFTTT]], IKEA, Trad Free Lights, Internet                    |
| 34:21      | Request, [[IR Blaster]], which is, Flick makes an [[IR Blaster]] too that you can use to turn                 |
| 34:27      | a point, like your TV on and off.                                                                     |
| 34:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:31      | So LIFX, Philips Hue, Play a Sound, [[Slack]] Post, Sonos, [[Spotify]], Zapier, VLC, Wemo, Wink.              |
| 34:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:41      | They've got all the major suspects covered.                                                           |
| 34:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:45      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 34:46      | So you, so you're just using one and it's, you've got those two setups.                               |
| 34:50      | That's cool.                                                                                          |
| 34:51      | Well, I have five around the house, but that's the one that's in my office.                           |
| 34:57      | One of them just turns on the whole entertainment system.                                             |
| 34:59      | It's mounted underneath the lip of the dining room, coffee table.                                     |
| 35:03      | So using the [[IR Blaster]] to do that, I mean, you still got to get a TV turned on, okay.                |
| 35:08      | I use the [[IR]], and I use a [[Logitech Harmony\|Harmony]], whatever their hub is called.                                      |
| 35:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:16      | I think it's the [[Logitech Harmony\|Logitech Harmony Hub]] or something along those lines.                                 |
| 35:20      | Something like that, yeah.                                                                            |
| 35:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:22      | I feel like everybody who's interested in automation eventually gets to the point where               |
| 35:25      | they want to automate their TV, right?                                                                |
| 35:29      | And it's hard.                                                                                        |
| 35:30      | The first thing a lot of people want to.                                                              |
| 35:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:32      | It's hard because you have the different inputs and they're using old technology, you know,           |
| 35:37      | really, I mean, to get them working.                                                                  |
| 35:40      | So is that, is that, so you're solving that problem with the [[Logitech Harmony\|Harmony remote]] and the flip              |
| 35:44      | buttons?                                                                                              |
| 35:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:46      | I like the [[Logitech Harmony\|Harmony remote]].                                                                            |
| 35:48      | I have programmed to control my soundbar, my TV, and my [[Apple TV]], and the Roku.                       |
| 35:56      | So I basically, I can narrow it down to just one remote.                                              |
| 35:59      | I keep the [[Apple TV]] remote out because the touchpad is basically how you navigate.                    |
| 36:07      | But for turning power on, off, changing inputs, volume, all done through the Logitech Harmony\|Harmony remote]].          |
| 36:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:15      | I forget how much, Brett.                                                                             |
| 36:17      | I mean, from your very roots with the X10, you have always been a guy that liked to not               |
| 36:21      | only automate like pixels moving around on your screen, but just automate everything                  |
| 36:26      | in your life.                                                                                         |
| 36:27      | I am enamoured with automation.                                                                        |
| 36:30      | Now, I remember when you were telling me, I forget the name of the device, there was                  |
| 36:34      | that device that sold for a while where you could wave your hands in front of your computer           |
| 36:38      | and it could.                                                                                         |
| 36:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:40      | Spatially be aware of your hands.                                                                     |
| 36:41      | The leap.                                                                                             |
| 36:42      | Leap motion.                                                                                          |
| 36:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:44      | Yeah, because you had connected automation to that as well.                                           |
| 36:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:48      | Basically, that performs mostly gestures for me, like poking three fingers forwards, plays            |
| 36:54      | and pause music, and turning like there's a dial in front of me will actually change                  |
| 36:58      | the volume, and I can flip pages when I'm reading in a newsreader.                                    |
| 37:03      | I can skip to the next story by just swiping left, and yeah, I do a lot with that.                    |
| 37:08      | This is kind of like a touch bar on steroids because you don't need the touch bar.                    |
| 37:11      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 37:12      | You don't need to actually touch it.                                                                  |
| 37:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:14      | You know, the thing though, because looking at it, I'm like, then I got to have a cable               |
| 37:19      | across my desk and this hardware on my desk at all times.                                             |
| 37:23      | That's the thing that turned me off.                                                                  |
| 37:24      | I got to admit.                                                                                       |
| 37:25      | Your desk must be much neater than mine because I have to actually move things to make sure           |
| 37:28      | it's clear.                                                                                           |
| 37:32      | That's cool.                                                                                          |
| 37:33      | I'm glad you're still using it.                                                                       |
| 37:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:35      | Now, that's pretty cool.                                                                              |
| 37:36      | Going back to Siri, do you ever use Siri on the [[Apple TV]]?                                             |
| 37:40      | Yes, all the time.                                                                                    |
| 37:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:43      | And it's great for dictating in searches and stuff.                                                   |
| 37:45      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 37:46      | For searches, and my absolute favourite feature is, what did she just say?                             |
| 37:50      | And it rewinds 30 seconds, turns on subtitles for you for 30 seconds.                                 |
| 37:56      | It's perfect.                                                                                         |
| 37:57      | Yeah, I know.                                                                                         |
| 37:58      | It's great.                                                                                           |
| 37:59      | And it's like when I have family members that I watch them entering my hand a search,                 |
| 38:04      | you know, and it's the worst search ever because you get all like.                                    |
| 38:06      | That answering keyboard is the worst.                                                                 |
| 38:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:09      | And it just makes me crazy that they don't want to press them.                                        |
| 38:12      | Even though I do it in front of them all of the time.                                                 |
| 38:15      | And then.                                                                                             |
| 38:16      | I stop my girlfriend regularly.                                                                       |
| 38:18      | Just say it.                                                                                          |
| 38:19      | Just say it.                                                                                          |
| 38:20      | Stop typing.                                                                                          |
| 38:21      | I do think it's on [[Apple]] a little bit because you have to have the cursor in the right place          |
| 38:27      | to make the search work.                                                                              |
| 38:29      | I feel like the operating system could be fixed to say, look, if you're in YouTube and you            |
| 38:34      | hold the microphone button down, just go to the search and type in, you know, it's not                |
| 38:38      | that hard.                                                                                            |
| 38:39      | You're in YouTube and just saying open Netflix and wouldn't be able to do that.                       |
| 38:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:45      | That's true.                                                                                          |
| 38:46      | But at the same time, it could, because Siri knows what you're saying, right?                         |
| 38:50      | Siri has to know what you're saying to be able to dictate something or execute the command.           |
| 38:55      | And so if you say something like open Netflix or turn the volume up, then, you know, obviously        |
| 39:00      | Siri should do that.                                                                                  |
| 39:01      | But if you say something and it goes, I'll put this in the search of the application that             |
| 39:06      | I'm currently in.                                                                                     |
| 39:07      | That would be a smart solution from [[Apple]] and that would be a great automation for us                 |
| 39:11      | so that we could be even lazier, which everybody loves to be.                                         |
| 39:14      | You know, you can specify apps to search now.                                                         |
| 39:18      | You can say search for this in YouTube or search Netflix for this.                                    |
| 39:23      | I discovered it.                                                                                      |
| 39:24      | You know how when you hit the mic button and then let go, it'll just start scrolling things           |
| 39:29      | you can say.                                                                                          |
| 39:30      | I noticed very recently that now you can say search for blank in YouTube.                             |
| 39:37      | And it'll do a YouTube search.                                                                        |
| 39:39      | And does this work if you're inside the YouTube application?                                          |
| 39:42      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 39:43      | But you have to say in YouTube.                                                                       |
| 39:44      | Well, I think that's a reasonable trade-off.                                                          |
| 39:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 39:48      | That works.                                                                                           |
| 39:49      | That works.                                                                                           |
| 39:50      | I wish.                                                                                               |
| 39:51      | That's gotta be new though.                                                                           |
| 39:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 39:53      | Yeah, I just, and I wish Netflix would get on that train.                                             |
| 39:56      | I don't know why they're not.                                                                         |
| 39:57      | With searchability?                                                                                   |
| 39:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 39:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:00      | I've got this picture in my head of Brett's kitchen and there's like string attached                  |
| 40:04      | to the toaster and like the bread pops out and then it like goes through some contraption             |
| 40:10      | that puts butter on it.                                                                               |
| 40:12      | If I lived by myself, that would be entirely believable.                                              |
| 40:16      | So this is the machine in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, essentially, the practice making machine.             |
| 40:21      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 40:22      | Do you ever see, what was that, the character's name was Data and the movie was the Goonies.          |
| 40:31      | Did you ever see the Goonies, Brett?                                                                  |
| 40:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:34      | I think you're Data growing up.                                                                       |
| 40:36      | Yeah, I could see that.                                                                               |
| 40:38      | I mean, he would open his jacket and have a little fist that would punch out from his                 |
| 40:41      | belt.                                                                                                 |
| 40:42      | Yup.                                                                                                  |
| 40:43      | The only difference is yours would work on Bluetooth.                                                 |
| 40:49      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 40:50      | On voice commands.                                                                                    |
| 40:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:52      | You know, another thing that you do, I want to talk about to our Automator's audience,                |
| 40:56      | but in fact, I'm going to tease that.                                                                 |
| 40:58      | We're going to be right back.                                                                         |
| 40:59      | I got something I need to talk to you about.                                                          |
| 41:03      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Creative Next.                                        |
| 41:06      | Creative Next is a new podcast focusing on future-proofing creatives from AI Automation.              |
| 41:12      | They believe the future of automation is about people like you and me, because work automation        |
| 41:16      | isn't all about industrial robots.                                                                    |
| 41:20      | Automation driven by artificial intelligence is already doing remarkable things, like impacting       |
| 41:24      | research, writing, marketing, art, design, engineering, and entrepreneurship, and this                |
| 41:30      | kind of thing is likely to accelerate in the years to come.                                           |
| 41:33      | So this is what Creative Next covers.                                                                 |
| 41:36      | The first season is about learning, learning about AI and automation, understanding how               |
| 41:41      | machines work with early automation successes, and how they'll look at how people may learn           |
| 41:46      | in the future.                                                                                        |
| 41:48      | Creative Next is available from Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and wherever else           |
| 41:53      | you'd like to listen to your podcast.                                                                 |
| 41:54      | Plus, they have a companion article series on Medium that's in partnership with Towards               |
| 41:59      | Data Science.                                                                                         |

| 42:13      | Brett, keyboard bindings.                                                                             |
| 42:16      | This is the only podcast where we can get really excited talking about keyboard bindings.             |
| 42:21      | But for those listening, Brett has wrote a series of posts over the years about basically             |
| 42:29      | telling his keyboard to do different things.                                                          |
| 42:32      | The one that really got my attention was the caps lock key.                                           |
| 42:35      | Who uses the caps lock key for caps lock, right?                                                      |
| 42:38      | So Brett came up with the idea, why don't we make that something that's more useful?                  |
| 42:47      | And to do that is not simple.                                                                         |
| 42:50      | You went down, it's almost a system level thing, explained for us how you are reimagining             |
| 42:57      | your keyboard and telling the keys to do different things than they're supposed to do.                |
| 43:01      | Because it's actually kind of an interesting automation.                                              |
| 43:03      | All right, so first off, it was not my idea.                                                          |
| 43:08      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 43:09      | I got the idea from another blog post, which I've long forgotten, but Space Cadet, I could            |
| 43:15      | find the original post for you.                                                                       |
| 43:17      | I just kind of took it and I ran with it.                                                             |
| 43:19      | It uses an app called Karabiner and Karabiner is a way to program at as close to the keyboard         |
| 43:28      | between the system and the keyboard as you can get without actually having a programmable             |
| 43:32      | keyboard.                                                                                             |
| 43:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:34      | So it runs as a kernel extension.                                                                     |
| 43:36      | And as your keystrokes come in, it changes the mapping so that as far as the system is                |
| 43:42      | concerned, you've hit whatever key you told it you hit.                                               |
| 43:46      | So you can change the cap slot key, you disable it in system preferences, and then you can            |
| 43:51      | change it and mine sends control option command shift all at once.                                    |
| 43:58      | So then I can use that what would be a very awkward keyboard hotkey combination, I can                |
| 44:05      | now use and trigger combinations with the rest of the keyboard.                                       |
| 44:08      | So like for me, holding down hyperkey terms, H, J, K and else into arrow keys for me.                 |
| 44:17      | Just as an example.                                                                                   |
| 44:18      | And it basically anything you can then program with [[Keyboard Maestro]] or [[BetterTouchTool]],            |
| 44:24      | you can then assign to keys with abandon because it's you're not going to overwrite any other         |
| 44:29      | shortcuts with them.                                                                                  |
| 44:31      | And then if you just tap it once, it's an escape key.                                                 |
| 44:34      | Perfect.                                                                                              |
| 44:35      | And nobody is crazy enough to use a shortcut modifier shift control option command.                   |
| 44:41      | I mean, it's just like, right, you got to tie your fingers in a pretzel to do that.                   |
| 44:45      | But now you've been able to turn that into one key.                                                   |
| 44:48      | And the part that I think for listeners, I want you to go check out the blog post that                |
| 44:52      | this is at all interest to you.                                                                       |
| 44:54      | It's a little intimidating when you set it up because you're right, you're jumping into               |
| 44:57      | the system right at the lowest level as soon as those key that key entry comes in.                    |
| 45:04      | And but Brett's really explained it nicely on his blog post.                                          |
| 45:07      | It's not difficult to do.                                                                             |
| 45:09      | This is great because I have several keyboard shortcuts, which I use command option and               |
| 45:14      | control with just because I don't trigger them any other way.                                         |
| 45:19      | So being able to add the shift key, that's going to take me up a level.                               |
| 45:23      | And only have to use one key.                                                                         |
| 45:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 45:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 45:27      | It's handy.                                                                                           |
| 45:28      | And then I combine that with my default key bindings.                                                 |
| 45:32      | I don't know if you guys are familiar with the key binding system in Mac OS.                          |
| 45:39      | It's been there since the beginning.                                                                  |
| 45:41      | Let's go down that road together.                                                                     |
| 45:42      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 45:43      | So tell us about it.                                                                                  |
| 45:46      | It's been there.                                                                                      |
| 45:47      | It's always it's always been a part of Mac OS and things like control a and control e for             |
| 45:52      | moving the cursor are like the Emacs key bindings.                                                    |
| 45:56      | So there's that whole series.                                                                         |
| 45:58      | But then you can modify keystrokes and I mean, at a, at a simple level, you could make it             |
| 46:06      | so that when your coworker hits the key e key and they type in e, it types out a whole                |
| 46:12      | string about, you know, something rude as a practical joke.                                           |
| 46:17      | But you can then also use it with modifier keys.                                                      |
| 46:19      | So I can have control command w start a sequence.                                                     |
| 46:26      | And then if I hit I, it inserts a markdown image using my clipboard, or if I hit control              |
| 46:31      | command w ID, it'll actually with a Droplr shortened link, if you add a plus at the end              |
| 46:39      | of it, it's a direct link.                                                                            |
| 46:41      | So it'll insert an image tag with the clipboard with a plus at the end of it.                         |
| 46:46      | So I can insert a markdown tag for a Droplr image.                                                   |
| 46:52      | That is very smart.                                                                                   |
| 46:54      | I'm pausing for applause, but I have detailed these fairly extensively and I have a whole             |
| 47:01      | a huge collection of examples that are on GitHub and linked from my blog.                             |
| 47:06      | I can give you the link to that.                                                                      |
| 47:08      | But that kind of key binding and key mapping is also very, it's not like kernel level,                |
| 47:15      | but it's base system level and it works across all applications.                                      |
| 47:19      | I think it's really smart.                                                                            |
| 47:21      | It's just, you know, I am literally adding this link.                                                 |
| 47:24      | Link to the show notes right now.                                                                     |
| 47:26      | So if you are at all interested in this, check it out.                                                |
| 47:29      | And if you're not interested, check it out anyway, because you'll probably see some things            |
| 47:32      | in there that make you go, Oh, I could use this, like being able to change word to uppercase          |
| 47:37      | and lowercase and title case, or title casing an entire paragraph, like, you know, that's             |
| 47:43      | the kind of thing that actually I need.                                                               |
| 47:44      | Why am I not using this thing?                                                                        |
| 47:49      | Do you guys know that [[BetterTouchTool]] can do sequences now?                                         |
| 47:52      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 47:53      | So you can, you can have series of keys triggered.                                                    |
| 47:59      | So like, basically, like I was talking about with control command W, and then another key,            |
| 48:04      | you can do that in BetterTouchTools.                                                                |
| 48:06      | So you can have one sequence, one key stroke start a sequence, but then different characters          |
| 48:13      | complete it so that you can group, like your, like Q, W, E, R, T keys can have completely             |
| 48:20      | different meanings depending on what you hit before them, which is great because I just               |
| 48:26      | got this Keybow from Pimoroni.                                                                            |
| 48:31      | It's a 12 key external keypad with glowing keys completely customisable runs on a raspberry           |
| 48:38      | pie.                                                                                                  |
| 48:39      | And with those 12 keys, I can have hundreds of shortcuts.                                             |
| 48:43      | So like, if I hit any of the bottom three keys, then it changes what's going to happen                |
| 48:51      | when I hit the remaining nine keys.                                                                   |
| 48:53      | So I have a lot of fun with that kind of stuff.                                                       |
| 48:56      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 48:57      | And are you triggering that through key bindings?                                                     |
| 48:58      | Are you doing that through [[BetterTouchTool]]?                                                         |
| 49:02      | [[BetterTouchTool]], like I have, I have the keyboard itself set up to just send function               |
| 49:09      | 13 through like 21 keys, which exists, but no keyboard has them.                                      |
| 49:18      | So it sends those and then I can just use a [[BetterTouchTool]] to do whatever I want                   |
| 49:24      | with them.                                                                                            |
| 49:25      | Now, but you say now Keybow is a, is a keyboard through a Raspberry Pi.                                |
| 49:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 49:32      | Wouldn't just any external like gaming keyboard or keypad work for the same thing?                    |
| 49:37      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 49:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 49:39      | I mean, so let's make it easier for listeners.                                                        |
| 49:41      | You don't have to go set up a Raspberry Pi to do this.                                               |
| 49:43      | You can go on [[Amazon]] and buy any really ten key, right?                                                 |
| 49:48      | Or you can even like, if you've got an extended keyboard, you could attach it to the number           |
| 49:52      | pad keys.                                                                                             |
| 49:53      | I mean, something people don't realise is [[BetterTouchTool]] that has, again, one of                   |
| 50:01      | the, the, the most remarkable automation tools out there for the Mac.                                 |
| 50:07      | But the developer has got to that inflection point where he can now work on this full time.           |
| 50:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 50:13      | There's enough people paying to support him that he can make it better.                               |
| 50:16      | Well, and he finally started charging.                                                                |
| 50:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 50:18      | And, and so that's really great because now we're getting some like, I didn't know that               |
| 50:22      | feature was added, but just the other day someone was telling me, well, I've got the                  |
| 50:25      | touch bar and I hate it and there's nothing good about it.                                            |
| 50:28      | I said, go download [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                |
| 50:30      | If you have a touch bar on your laptop, you can put stuff on there like the time or whatever,         |
| 50:35      | you know, just pieces of data that are important to you are just going to show up there.              |
| 50:40      | And I feel like [[BetterTouchTool]] is like, I mean, it'll never get sure locked because                |
| 50:47      | it's too nerdy, but man, [[Apple]] didn't even think about that stuff when they shipped the,              |
| 50:53      | you know, this touch bar.                                                                             |
| 50:54      | But anyway.                                                                                           |
| 50:55      | Well, and all the way back to its original intention with the track pad, like I am so                 |
| 51:01      | used to having [[BetterTouchTool]] so that when I hold down my first finger and my ring finger          |
| 51:07      | and then tap my middle finger in between, it refreshes my web page.                                    |
| 51:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 51:11      | Like I don't even think about those gestures anymore.                                                 |
| 51:14      | They just become so ingrained.                                                                        |
| 51:15      | I, I would cry if [[BetterTouchTool]] stop working.                                                     |
| 51:19      | Or when you sit down at a Mac, I had the same thing I've got, it's like playing the piano             |
| 51:23      | when I sit and use my, my touch pad, I've got so many different [[BetterTouchTool]] things              |
| 51:27      | going on and I sat down on my wife's computer and I just, I, I try to do my, my piano moves,          |
| 51:33      | play my chords, right?                                                                                |
| 51:35      | Nothing works.                                                                                        |
| 51:36      | I'm like, what the heck's wrong with this computer?                                                   |
| 51:37      | Right?                                                                                                |
| 51:38      | You just get, you get used to it.                                                                     |
| 51:40      | But yeah.                                                                                             |
| 51:41      | And once you get used to a hyper key and you're on someone else's computer and it really is           |
| 51:44      | just a cap slot key, that'll mess you up constantly.                                                  |
| 51:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 51:48      | But I mean, so with [[BetterTouchTool]], it works with the magic mouse track pads, keyboards.           |
| 51:55      | I think it works with that, that hand wavy thing, the leap thing, motioning.                          |
| 52:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:02      | It works with a touch bar.                                                                            |
| 52:03      | That's how, all of my automation with that is through a [[BetterTouchTool]].                            |
| 52:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:07      | Oh man.                                                                                               |
| 52:08      | You know, that is a, if you're listening and you haven't tried [[BetterTouchTool]], just download       |
| 52:11      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 52:12      | It is such a great application for people who want to make more of automation.                        |
| 52:16      | And what Brett was talking about earlier is you can make custom touches on the track                  |
| 52:20      | pad that, I mean, there's almost no end of how obscure they can get and, or you can make              |
| 52:29      | really simple ones.                                                                                   |
| 52:30      | Like force press on the lower left corner on mine, takes the current window and puts                  |
| 52:36      | it on the left side of the screen.                                                                    |
| 52:37      | It's just a simple little thing, but yeah, I use it, you know, what, a hundred times                  |
| 52:41      | a day.                                                                                                |
| 52:42      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 52:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:44      | So, a sequence from pinkie to bring, or a front to index finger, so like, we'll kind                   |
| 52:51      | of right to left, that'll move the window to half screen on the left side.                            |
| 52:56      | And you'd probably do the opposite for the other.                                                     |
| 52:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 52:59      | And if I go one, two, four, three, it'll centre the window.                                           |
| 53:03      | So the automators listeners, if we get you doing the key bindings and [[BetterTouchTool]],              |
| 53:11      | you're going to completely change the way you use your Mac.                                           |
| 53:14      | And we should mention, if anybody has set up and they haven't installed better touch                  |
| 53:19      | tool, it's part of set up now as well, so you can get it through there.                               |
| 53:23      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 53:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:25      | A lot of people probably already got it and they, they, they don't know what they're missing          |
| 53:29      | or they didn't know what they were missing until this episode.                                        |
| 53:32      | Brett, share a couple more of your favourite track pad movements gestures with better touch            |
| 53:38      | tool.                                                                                                 |
| 53:39      | Sure, I have it so that if I hold down the three fingers other than my index finger and               |
| 53:45      | then swipe my index finger from the outside of the track pad to the inside.                           |
| 53:50      | So that sounds like a complex move, but it's not.                                                     |
| 53:53      | You're basically three finger stationary and then swipe in that will wherever the cursor              |
| 53:58      | is at the time, it will display the menu bar menu at that point.                                      |
| 54:03      | So I don't have to go up to the top of the screen and dig through menus.                              |
| 54:07      | I can just swipe and open the menu bar menus as like a little pop up from where my cursor             |
| 54:14      | is at the time.                                                                                       |
| 54:17      | Refreshing web pages.                                                                                 |
| 54:18      | When I'm web browsing, if I hold down three fingers and tap the fourth finger to either               |
| 54:24      | the left or right, it'll switch tabs.                                                                 |
| 54:27      | And if I, let's see, oh, and then swiping left and right with three fingers is history                |
| 54:35      | forward and back.                                                                                     |
| 54:36      | Yeah, I do tabs with the swipes.                                                                      |
| 54:39      | That way.                                                                                             |
| 54:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 54:41      | So, you know, it's always a pain when you're in [[Safari]] or even [[Google Chrome\|Chrome]] and you have another            |
| 54:45      | tab you want to get to and using these gestures.                                                      |
| 54:48      | It's so much better than trying to find a touch target with your mouse and clicking.                  |
| 54:52      | It's not even close.                                                                                  |
| 54:55      | And then you can have different different actions happen, whether your cursor is over                 |
| 55:01      | the menu bar or the dock.                                                                             |
| 55:03      | So like, if I do a three finger swipe down in like most places, it doesn't do much.                   |
| 55:09      | But if I'm over the menu bar at the time, it'll open my terminal visor.                               |
| 55:13      | And these are the, I presume you're using actions with the investor touch tool for some               |
| 55:17      | of this.                                                                                              |
| 55:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 55:19      | Correct.                                                                                              |
| 55:20      | In that case, it's sending just the keystroke, the hot key that I have assigned to the visor.         |
| 55:26      | But like for turning my office lights on with a key swipe or a finger swipe, that executes            |
| 55:33      | terminal commands that communicate with my Indigo instance.                                           |
| 55:38      | I could go on.                                                                                        |
| 55:39      | I have a whole page here I'm looking at, but.                                                         |
| 55:42      | Well, these are absolutely genius.                                                                    |
| 55:44      | I have, because I mean, I have better touch to install it and I've got it doing a lot                 |
| 55:48      | of things.                                                                                            |
| 55:49      | And if I have a new Mac, like I recently got a new MacBook Air and I didn't have better               |
| 55:53      | touch to install to start with, and I kept tapping on things with three fingers.                      |
| 55:58      | And nothing was happening.                                                                            |
| 55:59      | And this was very confusing.                                                                          |
| 56:00      | And I was like, ah, I'm missing [[BetterTouchTool]] because I use three finger tap as a middle          |
| 56:05      | click, which in [[Google Chrome\|Chrome]], [[Safari]], [[Firefox]] will open a link in a new tab.                                |
| 56:12      | And very basic one.                                                                                   |
| 56:15      | Do you use PopClip?                                                                                  |
| 56:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 56:17      | I do not.                                                                                             |
| 56:18      | But I know that you have a whole series of actions for PopClip.                                      |
| 56:21      | I do.                                                                                                 |
| 56:22      | But what I'm going to say, though, is actually still [[BetterTouchTool]] because I can stay             |
| 56:25      | on topic.                                                                                             |
| 56:27      | Um, uh, David, when you, uh, does it ever fail to bring up the PopClip window after                  |
| 56:33      | you've selected?                                                                                      |
| 56:34      | Because, or you've selected text with the keyboard.                                                   |
| 56:37      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 56:38      | If you select text with the keyboard, PopClip doesn't activate.                                      |
| 56:40      | So that's a pain.                                                                                     |
| 56:42      | So you can add, I mine is a tip tap middle and you can have it run an [[AppleScript]] to                 |
| 56:48      | launch PopClip.                                                                                      |
| 56:50      | So when I've selected text and for whatever reason the PopClip window hasn't come up,                |
| 56:55      | I can just tip tap on my, uh, keypad or on my trackpad and bring up PopClip to way to                |
| 57:03      | force PopClip open.                                                                                  |
| 57:05      | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| 57:06      | That is genius.                                                                                       |
| 57:07      | I'm going to have to get a trackpad for my work machine now because at work, I use a                  |
| 57:12      | logitech MS master to, yes, I have no idea what it's called.                                          |
| 57:16      | I'm using a very fancy mouse.                                                                         |
| 57:17      | It's got a lot of buttons on it.                                                                      |
| 57:19      | Uh, but it's also really nicely shaped so my, my hands don't hurt at the end of the                   |
| 57:22      | day.                                                                                                  |
| 57:23      | Sure.                                                                                                 |
| 57:24      | But I'm now probably going to have to have a trackpad on my desk as well.                             |
| 57:27      | There are so much more you can do with a trackpad than any fancy mouse.                               |
| 57:30      | If you use better track pads, don't hurt my wrist.                                                    |
| 57:34      | All mice seem to accept for vertical mice.                                                            |
| 57:37      | Well, this isn't quite a vertical mouse.                                                              |
| 57:39      | It is like, I think it's called a gaming mouse.                                                       |
| 57:42      | I have no idea, but it is a very comfortable mouse for me to use.                                     |
| 57:45      | There is one button on it that I can't use because otherwise my thumb will absolutely                 |
| 57:49      | kill me after an hour.                                                                                |
| 57:51      | Um, but apart from that, it's, it's, it's a great mouse, but I may have to get myself                 |
| 57:55      | a trackpad.                                                                                           |
| 57:56      | So.                                                                                                   |
| 57:57      | I agree.                                                                                              |
| 57:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 57:59      | I use a trackpad like the vast majority of the time, not at my desk.                                  |
| 58:03      | It's just at my desk because my, my laptop's on a riser.                                              |
| 58:07      | So using a trackpad is then hand floating, not very comfortable.                                      |
| 58:11      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 58:12      | Very unergonomic.                                                                                     |
| 58:13      | [[BetterTouchTool]] works with a magic mouse.                                                           |
| 58:15      | I don't feel that it's nearly as powerful though.                                                     |
| 58:18      | I mean, you need the space to, you know, you got to be able to put four fingers on it.                |
| 58:22      | And once you accept that you can do like those four finger touches and all the varieties              |
| 58:27      | of them, then it suddenly just opens things up.                                                       |
| 58:30      | And I think the answer to it, if you're trying this stuff out is every time you get annoyed           |
| 58:35      | that you're using your mouse, you know, like every time you have to slow down and focus               |
| 58:39      | to get the mouse pointer exactly where you want it, just ask yourself if this is something            |
| 58:43      | you can't just automate with a [[BetterTouchTool]] gesture.                                             |
| 58:47      | Because there are, there are so many gestures, you know, three finger gestures, four finger           |
| 58:51      | gestures, two finger gestures, swiping, I mean, it's just crazy how much you can do                   |
| 58:56      | with it.                                                                                              |
| 58:57      | So you will not run out of canvas.                                                                    |
| 59:02      | It can even do the Siri remote.                                                                       |
| 59:04      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 59:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 59:06      | I never, I've never used that.                                                                        |
| 59:07      | I know that's an option that it has.                                                                  |
| 59:09      | Like you can use it.                                                                                  |
| 59:10      | I haven't either.                                                                                     |
| 59:11      | I only have one Siri remote and it's from ITV, so yeah, yeah, but what I love about                   |
| 59:16      | [[BetterTouchTool]] though is you can also set this to only do things in specific applications          |
| 59:20      | or in general do it, but not in this application, which is great if you want to create some           |
| 59:24      | stuff for just [[Photoshop]], but you don't want the same thing to activate when you're using             |
| 59:28      | pages.                                                                                                |
| 59:29      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 59:30      | You know, it's great.                                                                                 |
| 59:31      | And so you can memorise these, you know, keyboard comma or track pack commands with your fingers      |
| 59:36      | and they'll do whatever it is that you need to do in whatever application you're in.                  |
| 59:41      | Awesome.                                                                                              |
| 59:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 59:43      | So good.                                                                                              |
| 59:44      | Well, Brett, we made it through a full episode of The Automators.                                     |
| 59:49      | The only money you made up costing me is a flick button, so I'm going to call that a                  |
| 59:54      | win.                                                                                                  |
| 59:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 59:56      | I mean, I'm probably going to be out one iMac Pro track pad because I think Space Gray                |
| 01:00:00   | is going to get dirty a lot less quickly than the standard white one, but I feel like                 |
| 01:00:05   | I've gotten off cheaply, so thank you.                                                                |
| 01:00:08   | And most of what I do is free to the public, so we're all basically not spending or making            |
| 01:00:15   | any money.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:17   | Well, we're having a good time.                                                                       |
| 01:00:19   | And I really like this stuff you've done.                                                             |
| 01:00:21   | I mean, Brett, there's just so many different little rabbit holes of automation over at your          |
| 01:00:26   | website, brettterpstra.com, and I recommend everybody go check it out.                                |
| 01:00:29   | We're going to have a bunch of links in the show notes.                                               |
| 01:00:32   | If you really want to do something interesting, I think this keyboard stuff is some of Brett's        |
| 01:00:38   | best work.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:39   | I'd never even thought of it, and you take something that's sitting on all of our desks               |
| 01:00:43   | and just make it more useful, and that's how we all love Brett Terpstra.                              |
| 01:00:47   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:48   | I love you too.                                                                                       |
| 01:00:49   | Thank you.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:50   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:51   | We are The Automators.                                                                                |
| 01:00:52   | Oh, Brett, anywhere else we should point people other than brettterpstra.com?                         |
| 01:00:57   | You can find me as ttscoff everywhere on every social service, and then I do have two podcasts        |
| 01:01:04   | that are currently on hiatus, but I'll mention Overtired and Systematic because they may              |
| 01:01:09   | even be back up by the time this podcast is published.                                                |
| 01:01:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:13   | And I'm a particular fan of Overtired with what you do with Christina Warren.                         |
| 01:01:18   | I think the two of you together are just a great combination for a podcast, and bring                 |
| 01:01:23   | us more, please.                                                                                      |
| 01:01:26   | Working on it.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:27   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:28   | We're The Automators.                                                                                 |
| 01:01:29   | You can find us over on relay.fm/automators.                                                    |
| 01:01:31   | Rose, anything exciting going on in your life over your blog these days?                              |
| 01:01:36   | No, not particularly exciting, but don't forget we do do a blog post to accompany every show,         |
| 01:01:43   | and that alternates between David's and my blogs, so make sure to check those out as                  |
| 01:01:47   | well.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:48   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:49   | And we will have a lot of show notes this time, so you can go check out all this cool                 |
| 01:01:52   | stuff Brett's been doing.                                                                             |
| 01:01:53   | Thank you to our sponsors, Creative Next and ExpressVPN.                                              |
| 01:01:57   | Hey, before we leave, we just wanted to also shout out that all three of us are going to              |
| 01:02:01   | be attending [[Macstock]] this July, and we'll put a link in the show notes for that as well.             |
| 01:02:07   | Macstock in my mind is the successor of Macworld.                                                     |
| 01:02:11   | If you're a user, if you like power user kinds of things, you're going to love it.                    |
| 01:02:15   | Head out to Macstock, and you're speaking out there this year, right?                                 |
| 01:02:19   | I am, and so is Rosemary.                                                                             |
| 01:02:20   | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:21   | David, we'll be recording episode 500 of [[Mac Power Users]], they're live with [[Stephen Hackett]]                   |                                                                                   |
| 01:02:27   | Yeah, we're going to have a lot of fun, and it's just great.                                          |
| 01:02:30   | I went last year for the first time, so Brett's been going for years, and he's been telling           |
| 01:02:35   | me about it.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:36   | So it really is fun, and if you missed out on Macworld, you should check this out.                    |
| 01:02:41   | It's a great weekend surrounded with a bunch of people that love nothing better than giving           |
| 01:02:46   | the most out of their technology.                                                                     |
| 01:02:47   | Yes, and there will be stickers, just FYI.                                                            |
| 01:02:51   | There shall be stickers.                                                                              |
| 01:02:52   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:02:53   | We'll see you all next week, or actually we'll see you all in two weeks.                              |

| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this                    |
| 00:06      | is The Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work                 |
| 00:10      | for you.                                                                                               |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                                                       |
| 00:12      | Hello, David.                                                                                          |
| 00:13      | How are you?                                                                                           |
| 00:14      | Good.                                                                                                  |
| 00:15      | Today, we're going to be talking about automating music, which is one of my favourite things            |
| 00:20      | in the world.                                                                                          |
| 00:21      | I love music.                                                                                          |
| 00:22      | Yeah, I love music, too.                                                                               |
| 00:23      | I actually sat down and played the piano the other day, something I've not done in ages.               |
| 00:25      | That was good fun, but I haven't figured out automating it.                                            |
| 00:28      | How'd it go?                                                                                           |
| 00:29      | Well, let's just say I'm really out of practice, so I knew I wanted my fingers to go and what          |
| 00:32      | I wanted my fingers to do, but they didn't actually do any of that, so that was intriguing.            |
| 00:38      | Maybe I should try and automate it.                                                                    |
| 00:40      | When I play the piano, I am kind of on automation.                                                     |
| 00:44      | There's some songs I have under my fingers, and if I don't think about them, I can play                |
| 00:48      | them perfectly, and if I think about them, I crash and burn.                                           |
| 00:51      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 00:52      | Yes, it is exactly that.                                                                               |
| 00:53      | I was never a great pianist past mid-level exams in piano, but now if I sit down and                   |
| 00:58      | for it of piano, and I'm not thinking, I'm not terrible, but if I sit down and I think                 |
| 01:02      | or I try and read music and make my fingers follow the music, it ends badly, so I should               |
| 01:08      | probably stick to automating the playback of music instead of the playing of music right               |
| 01:13      | now.                                                                                                   |
| 01:14      | Well, that's what we're going to talk about today.                                                     |
| 01:16      | We've got this great music sources on our devices and our computers, and automation should             |
| 01:22      | come to the rescue for you, and this is an area that actually lends itself to very simplified          |
| 01:28      | automation.                                                                                            |
| 01:29      | I think if you're listening to this show and you haven't done a lot of automation, this                |
| 01:32      | is a great entry point for you.                                                                        |
| 01:33      | Yes, it really is, because there's so much that you can automate with music, and it can                |
| 01:38      | be as simple as whenever I do this, automatically start playing that playlist, or as complex           |
| 01:44      | as, and when I wake up in the morning, it will automatically start playing this playlist               |
| 01:48      | if it's a workday, but it's a different playlist on a non-workday, or handing off your music           |
| 01:54      | when you get home from work and things like that, so there's a lot of options out there                |
| 01:58      | for us.                                                                                                |
| 01:59      | Yeah, I agree, and interestingly, and we're going to try and cover both of these during                |
| 02:03      | the course of this show, it's really kind of a different story on the Mac versus iPhone                |
| 02:08      | and iPad, and they both have automation possibilities.                                                 |
| 02:14      | The Mac is, I would argue, kind of broader in what you can do with automation.                         |
| 02:18      | We had [[Doug Adams]] on the show recently from Doug's scripts, and so much of his website                 |
| 02:23      | is devoted to automating music, but that's all Mac stuff.                                              |
| 02:27      | It's [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]], and then over on the iOS side, you've got kind of a different tool                 |
| 02:31      | set.                                                                                                   |
| 02:32      | Yes, yes, you do, and it's intriguing that on the Mac, we turn to AppleScripts, so most               |
| 02:38      | people would assume that on iOS, you turn to shortcuts, and in some ways, you can turn                 |
| 02:43      | to shortcuts.                                                                                          |
| 02:44      | Shortcuts does have music integration, but really, you need to be looking at something                 |
| 02:48      | like Toolbox Pro or one of the other apps that we're going to get to later in today's                  |
| 02:51      | show to really automate your music.                                                                    |
| 02:54      | Yeah, and then the other kind of vector for this is the type of music you start, because               |
| 03:00      | for so long, automation of music involved your personal library, the music that you'd                  |
| 03:05      | bought and ripped into iTunes or stuff that you'd bought from the Apple iTunes store.                  |
| 03:12      | Whereas now, most people are using a music subscription service where they've got access               |
| 03:18      | to vast libraries that they're renting on a monthly basis, and that kind of changes the                |
| 03:23      | automation story a little bit too.                                                                     |
| 03:24      | Yes, it does.                                                                                          |
| 03:25      | It means, for example, I need to filter the music on my iPhone at certain points to just               |
| 03:31      | the downloaded music to play it, because I'm on a plane at 20,000 feet, or however many                |
| 03:36      | thousand feet I'm flying at, and there's not necessarily internet up there, and that's                 |
| 03:41      | something that you need to perhaps take into account with your automations, is the internet            |
| 03:44      | going to be available to you or not, which is something that we maybe don't think about                |
| 03:48      | so much with our other shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 03:49      | Yeah, in fact, that's one of my music automations to jump ahead a bit is I have, when I have           |
| 03:55      | trips planned, I have an automation that reminds me to download all my music before I get on           |
| 04:01      | an airplane, because if your phone starts running out of space, music is one of the things             |
| 04:05      | that will go.                                                                                          |
| 04:06      | So you want to make sure you get everything downloaded before you get to the airport.                  |
| 04:11      | Once you get to the airport, you're almost too late, because usually the connection quality            |
| 04:15      | and data stream available to you is pretty small, but that's something you want to do                  |
| 04:21      | the night before, but you definitely want that sort of download, because once the plane                |
| 04:24      | takes off, you're kind of out of luck.                                                                 |
| 04:26      | Yeah, I actually have an automation to help me download all of my music on my iPhone too,              |
| 04:30      | so we're going to have to circle back to this later in the show.                                       |
| 04:33      | Okay, well, where do you want to start?                                                                |
| 04:35      | Well, I think you would make the most sense to start on the Mac, because so many people                |
| 04:39      | for years stored all of their music in iTunes and curated their playlists and updated their            |
| 04:44      | album artwork, and manually added lyrics to things.                                                    |
| 04:47      | It feels like a shame to just gloss over the fact that a lot of people have these amazing              |
| 04:52      | music libraries, and they're all on our Macs ready to go, and the Mac is a great automation            |
| 04:56      | device.                                                                                                |
| 04:57      | You don't necessarily need to have a Mac Mini sitting your house as a server.                          |
| 05:00      | I mean, I have my Mac Mini at the desktop, but it's also sitting there running as a server             |
| 05:04      | doing other stuff in the background for me, including playing music, but it's a really                 |
| 05:10      | powerful tool, and we already mentioned Doug Scripts.                                                  |
| 05:14      | If you want to start automating iTunes or music, as we're now calling it on in Catalina,               |
| 05:20      | because they've split it up, then Doug Scripts and [[AppleScript]] are a great way to start               |
| 05:25      | with iTunes.                                                                                           |
| 05:26      | I agree.                                                                                               |
| 05:27      | I agree.                                                                                               |
| 05:28      | And so much of just in general on the Mac, the tool set available to you in historical                 |
| 05:34      | iTunes was massive.                                                                                    |
| 05:36      | I mean, some of the very first screencasts I ever published were iTunes Playlist stuff,                |
| 05:42      | where I would look at songs that have four or five stars that I haven't played in three                |
| 05:49      | months.                                                                                                |
| 05:50      | That was one of my favourite playlists, because it would find stuff that I liked that I hadn't          |
| 05:54      | heard recently, and it was automatically updating itself because once you play it, then it's           |
| 05:59      | been played within the last three months, and it gets dropped off the playlist, and it's               |
| 06:02      | a great way to listen to some of your favourite music that you don't hear all the time.                 |
| 06:06      | And Apple did a really good job at the beginning of creating those rule sets.                          |
| 06:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 06:12      | For people who've never played with a playlist in music or iTunes, it's very much like [[Hazel]]           |
| 06:18      | in that you can have a set of rules, and then instead of having the actions, there are no              |
| 06:23      | actions.                                                                                               |
| 06:24      | It's just these will then be in your playlist, but you can have inclusive actions or optional          |
| 06:29      | actions.                                                                                               |
| 06:30      | Either it's got four stars or five stars, and it's not been played in the last three                   |
| 06:36      | months, and you can make that group.                                                                   |
| 06:39      | And so I would recommend that everybody open up the music app, fire it up, even if you                 |
| 06:42      | don't play music on your Mac, because these smart playlists do actually sync over to iOS,              |
| 06:47      | which is one of the great reasons why you should actually fire up music, because you                   |
| 06:50      | can create these smart playlists, and then they'll be on your iPhone.                                  |
| 06:54      | So you can create a smart playlist, and you can add all of these rules.                                |
| 06:58      | But this is something that people always forget.                                                       |
| 07:01      | Press the option key when clicking the plus at some point, and then you can create a subgroup,         |
| 07:06      | which is how you would create your four or five stars, or three or four or five stars.                 |
| 07:12      | And then as well as the not played in the last three months options.                                   |
| 07:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:18      | And that option key is something that works throughout the operating system.                           |
| 07:24      | It also works in [[Hazel]], and it's just built in.                                                        |
| 07:27      | In fact, I was doing the screencast for a version of Fantastical, and I included that                  |
| 07:34      | in one of the screencasts, and the developer wrote me back, and he said, I didn't even                 |
| 07:37      | know that the app could do that, because it's built in, you know.                                      |
| 07:41      | So he discovered when he saw my screencast that that option existed.                                   |
| 07:44      | So that's a great trick to have up your sleeve when you're doing automation.                           |
| 07:49      | I was very worried when I heard that Apple was going to take iTunes out and put the                    |
| 07:54      | music app in, and I was afraid that they were going to remove a lot of that automation options,        |
| 08:00      | but fortunately, it still exists in the music app.                                                     |
| 08:03      | Yes, it does.                                                                                          |
| 08:04      | And that's a great thing.                                                                              |
| 08:05      | And I should mention, actually, something else you should do with the option key is open               |
| 08:09      | up any of the menus in the menu bar.                                                                   |
| 08:11      | So for example, in music, you could open up the song menu, and then if you press or let's              |
| 08:18      | try the edit menu, if you press the opt key where you have where those menus open, it usually          |
| 08:22      | shows you alternative menu items.                                                                      |
| 08:26      | And this is something that's really useful as well.                                                    |
| 08:27      | It appears the music app is not actually showing me any options here, but that's a useful trick        |
| 08:31      | that you can use in other apps.                                                                        |
| 08:32      | I used that in PDF pen yesterday, actually.                                                            |
| 08:35      | Yeah, so to get a new smart playlist in the music app, it's not as obvious as it used                  |
| 08:40      | to be.                                                                                                 |
| 08:41      | They had two or three ways you could turn them on before.                                              |
| 08:43      | Now you need to go to the file menu and hit new, and then there's a sub menu and it's                  |
| 08:48      | smart playlist.                                                                                        |
| 08:50      | You can also hit option command in, in the application, and it'll open a new smart playlist.           |
| 08:56      | And when you do, it gives you all these options.                                                       |
| 08:59      | And you can pick from a variety of different indexes on these songs.                                   |
| 09:04      | It goes from album, grouping, genre, size, I mean, it's just, I don't know, there's                    |
| 09:11      | maybe 30 or 40 different ways here that you can get through, like media kind is one I                  |
| 09:16      | used to use all the time because I would distinguish between albums and video.                         |
| 09:23      | Or for my legal stuff, I would rip all my, when I'd buy the CDs for the continuing legal               |
| 09:29      | education, I would have a different genre for that called CLE.                                         |
| 09:34      | And then I would exclude that from all of my playlists because I didn't want to accidentally           |
| 09:39      | trip into somebody talking about contracts on listening to jazz.                                       |
| 09:42      | So you can do quite a bit with this.                                                                   |
| 09:45      | Yes, yes, you can.                                                                                     |
| 09:46      | This is really, for me, a great, I think, a great entry point for automation.                          |
| 09:51      | Yeah, it really is.                                                                                    |
| 09:52      | And I would highly encourage people to do this.                                                        |
| 09:55      | Depending on what metadata you have added to your music, you may be best of limiting                   |
| 10:01      | yourself to things like when you added the item to your library.                                       |
| 10:05      | So if you added it to your library six months ago and you've not listened to it, that could            |
| 10:08      | be a great smart playlist because then it's going to encourage you to listen to those                  |
| 10:12      | things that you thought that you were going to listen to and you didn't get around to.                 |
| 10:15      | And that might, of course, be a great way to cull some of your music collection.                       |
| 10:19      | I know my dad's recently been going through listening to stuff that he's had stored on                 |
| 10:23      | his device that he's never listened to.                                                                |
| 10:25      | And it's a lot of delete key action being used there.                                                  |
| 10:30      | But that's pretty useful.                                                                              |
| 10:31      | Yeah, there's really two types of metadata in the music app.                                           |
| 10:35      | There's the stuff that you can control, like the genre of music.                                       |
| 10:39      | Like years ago, I decided to make all of my Christmas music, Yule music, Y-U-L-E, because              |
| 10:45      | I thought that was just cooler in jazz parlance.                                                       |
| 10:47      | And it wasn't that hard.                                                                               |
| 10:48      | I selected them all and then did show information and changed the genre to Yule.                       |
| 10:53      | But I'm controlling that.                                                                              |
| 10:54      | Then there's the metadata that really is not your control, like when was it last played,               |
| 10:59      | when did you add it to the library, that kind of stuff.                                                |
| 11:02      | And combining those two is, I think, where you really get those magic playlists.                       |
| 11:07      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 11:08      | Yes, you do.                                                                                           |
| 11:09      | And even though, also, just to say real quick, there's one called Rating, it's a five star             |
| 11:15      | rating system.                                                                                         |
| 11:18      | Even though that's not visible anymore in the music app, that data is still there.                     |
| 11:23      | So you can also still use that, although I don't do it anymore.                                        |
| 11:26      | Yeah, I have to say, I'm actually a big fan of the very simple like and dislike and not                |
| 11:31      | rated feature, because that for me is very binary.                                                     |
| 11:36      | Before I very much struggled to decide what is a four or a five star.                                  |
| 11:40      | What is the difference between those two?                                                              |
| 11:42      | And everybody can decide that differently, but I would also decide that differently from               |
| 11:46      | song to song.                                                                                          |
| 11:47      | So it was never that consistent for me.                                                                |
| 11:50      | So I ended up with kind of just like one star, three star, five star, which would be like,             |
| 11:54      | don't like it.                                                                                         |
| 11:55      | For some reason, I need to keep this.                                                                  |
| 11:57      | Usually for things, you mentioned that you ripped the legal CDs.                                       |
| 12:00      | I used to have children's music CDs when I was an English teacher.                                     |
| 12:04      | Excuse me, you do not want to hear children's songs when you're flying on a plane to get               |
| 12:10      | to your next teaching job and you're just ready to zone out.                                           |
| 12:13      | You just want to be listening to whatever it is that you enjoy listening to.                           |
| 12:18      | And so I used to filter things based on that and just stick with one, three and five.                  |
| 12:23      | So don't like it.                                                                                      |
| 12:24      | It's okay.                                                                                             |
| 12:25      | And I love it.                                                                                         |
| 12:26      | And nowadays I just stick with like dislike and not rated yet.                                         |
| 12:31      | Yeah, yeah, I used to have one star being music that I did actively didn't like.                       |
| 12:37      | And then one day it occurred to me, why am I rating the stuff one star and not just deleting           |
| 12:41      | it from my library?                                                                                    |
| 12:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:44      | I would encourage people if you're rating things one star, delete it.                                  |
| 12:47      | I kept this stuff purely because I needed it.                                                          |
| 12:50      | Like, you know, when I was, when I was teaching, you know, you would need the music to play            |
| 12:54      | it onto the songs, but you don't want to suddenly start listening to an episode of Desert Island       |
| 12:57      | Discs in the middle of your relaxation session.                                                        |
| 13:00      | So.                                                                                                    |
| 13:01      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 13:02      | I kind of like some of those kids songs.                                                               |
| 13:03      | They remind me of when my kids were little, there was a great album by John Lithgow that                |
| 13:08      | had like, I'm a good new and from the Indies to the Andes and his Undies, I could see myself           |
| 13:14      | actually going back and listening to that.                                                             |
| 13:16      | Well, in my case, these were very much teaching dis so sometimes it was songs, but a lot of            |
| 13:20      | the time it was a random excerpt from, you know, some, somebody reading a Shakespeare                  |
| 13:26      | play or something like that, yeah, a bit of a mood killer when you're not expecting it.                |
| 13:32      | But we should probably move on and look at some of the great AppleScript options that                 |
| 13:36      | you can do because there's a lot that you can do.                                                      |
| 13:39      | One of the ones that I used to use a lot and I should probably get back into the habit                 |
| 13:43      | of using is the block party playlist, which is an AppleScript available on Doug's site.               |
| 13:49      | This is [[Doug Adams]], who was on the show recently.                                                      |
| 13:53      | And this allows you to create a playlist from a variety of artists.                                    |
| 13:58      | And it just puts either 25 artists and two tracks per artist in there, or you can specify              |
| 14:05      | a duration.                                                                                            |
| 14:06      | So how long it should last for.                                                                        |
| 14:08      | And I used to use this a lot for flying.                                                               |
| 14:11      | I would actually create a playlist for the approximate length of my flight, plus, you                  |
| 14:16      | know, half an hour or so.                                                                              |
| 14:18      | And that is a great way to just, you know, fill the time and listen to a bunch of different            |
| 14:23      | stuff that you wouldn't necessarily listen to all the time because it, you know, jazz                  |
| 14:29      | this thing's up a bit.                                                                                 |
| 14:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:31      | So what it does is it allows you to pick, instead of picking a few artists and a lot                   |
| 14:36      | of songs from them, it allows you to pick a lot of artists and a few songs from each,                  |
| 14:40      | which is kind of a different way about going about it.                                                 |
| 14:42      | And you can pick, you can pick the specific genres to be included, which is really nice.               |
| 14:48      | So like, for instance, I'm not really super into pop music.                                            |
| 14:52      | And when I hear block party, I'm like, oh, that's probably not for me.                                 |
| 14:55      | But actually know the way the script runs, I could put, you know, I could put cool jazz                |
| 14:59      | and then bebop and get a great playlist just for me.                                                   |
| 15:03      | So this is a good one.                                                                                 |
| 15:05      | Last updated in late 2019.                                                                             |
| 15:07      | So this is a very current script as well.                                                              |
| 15:09      | Yes, it is.                                                                                            |
| 15:10      | And you can also specify the playlist it should source things from, which means that in July           |
| 15:14      | you don't have to listen to Christmas songs, which is good because I have a smart playlist             |
| 15:18      | that just simply excludes Christmas.                                                                   |
| 15:20      | Anything involving Christmas or Yule somewhere in the genre is excluded because I have added,          |
| 15:26      | you have a shared playlist actually, David, that I added to my library so I could have                 |
| 15:29      | some Yule jazz in my life.                                                                             |
| 15:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 15:33      | I mean, the trick with the automation for the smart playlist is not only to be inclusive               |
| 15:38      | but exclusive and almost all of my playlist exclude Yule or holiday music by having a                  |
| 15:45      | consistent genre name in the naming conventions for your library, it makes it very easy to             |
| 15:51      | do that.                                                                                               |
| 15:52      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 15:53      | Actually, one of the things I did years ago, and I should double check if it's still possible          |
| 15:56      | is I actually specifically created an inclusive playlist of Christmas.                                 |
| 16:02      | And then I created an exclusive playlist of everything that is not in this playlist.                   |
| 16:07      | And then I use that as my basis for everything else because 99% of the time I don't want               |
| 16:13      | Christmas music mixed in with everything else.                                                         |
| 16:16      | And when I do, then I can just edit one playlist, which is then the base.                              |
| 16:20      | That smart playlist is used as the base for other ones.                                                |
| 16:24      | And that's pretty useful because then at Christmas time, December comes around, I can turn that        |
| 16:28      | off and just include that Christmas music.                                                             |
| 16:30      | And then the rest of the time I can exclude it, which is nice.                                         |
| 16:33      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 16:34      | Important question, Rose.                                                                              |
| 16:35      | What point do you start playing the Christmas music and what point do you stop playing it?             |
| 16:40      | So I allow it to filter into the rest of my music from December 1st, but I do have a relatively        |
| 16:46      | large library.                                                                                         |
| 16:47      | I say relatively, I don't think 20,000 songs is that large when you look at a lot of other             |
| 16:51      | people's libraries, but for me, that's large.                                                          |
| 16:53      | And I don't listen to music all day every day.                                                         |
| 16:56      | And then usually around about 10 days before Christmas, that's when I'll start playing                 |
| 17:01      | Christmas playlists.                                                                                   |
| 17:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 17:03      | I started a lot earlier than you.                                                                      |
| 17:05      | I started November.                                                                                    |
| 17:06      | I'm not going to judge you, but I like Christmas music.                                                |
| 17:08      | I just don't have a large enough selection of it that I won't go crazy listening to it.                |
| 17:12      | I like it.                                                                                             |
| 17:13      | I don't listen to it exclusively from during the holiday period, but I listen to it a lot.             |
| 17:17      | And then the other thing that's weird about me is the day after Christmas, I don't want                |
| 17:21      | to hear it anymore.                                                                                    |
| 17:22      | I don't play it anymore.                                                                               |
| 17:24      | I know a lot of folks play it through the new year.                                                    |
| 17:26      | I'm done after Christmas is over.                                                                      |
| 17:30      | I'm ready to move on.                                                                                  |
| 17:31      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 17:32      | That's the difference between you and me.                                                              |
| 17:33      | I'm going to wait until January 6th.                                                                   |
| 17:36      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 17:37      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 17:38      | We just moved our windows.                                                                             |
| 17:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 17:40      | That was up to one another.                                                                            |
| 17:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 17:42      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 17:43      | So Doug's Scripts, we talked about one of his scripts, but there's just so many there.                   |
| 17:46      | And we did do that show.                                                                               |
| 17:47      | I'd recommend going back and listening to Doug on that show if you have time.                          |
| 17:51      | But if you're going to be managing and automating music on a Macintosh, Doug's Scripts needs             |
| 17:57      | to be in your bookmarks.                                                                               |
| 18:00      | Yes, it does.                                                                                          |
| 18:01      | I feel like I should also give an honourable mention to another one that I've used recently,            |
| 18:05      | which is the Delete Empty Playlist script, because it turns out I had a whole bunch                    |
| 18:09      | of empty playlists hanging around in my music application, and I did not need that.                    |
| 18:15      | So I used the Delete Empty Playlist's [[AppleScript]] to just go through and clear up all                 |
| 18:20      | of that.                                                                                               |
| 18:21      | And that was great.                                                                                    |
| 18:22      | It saved me a lot of time.                                                                             |
| 18:23      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 18:24      | You've raised the spectre of playlists.                                                                |
| 18:26      | We've talked a little bit about smart playlists, which are great.                                      |
| 18:30      | You built them on the Mac.                                                                             |
| 18:31      | They're not an option on iPhone and iPad, but there's kind of a trick you can use.                     |
| 18:36      | So you make a smart playlist and let it grind through your library and get the music that              |
| 18:42      | matches all the criteria you've set up.                                                                |
| 18:45      | Then you copy all of that and you put it into a manually created playlist.                             |
| 18:50      | And then you have that synchronised over to your iPhone and iPad.                                      |
| 18:54      | And that's the best way I know to really get smart playlists on an iOS device, short of                |
| 18:59      | some apps we have in the outline.                                                                      |
| 19:00      | Well, I have found if you do create a smart playlist on your Mac, then it will synchronise             |
| 19:05      | over to your iPhone.                                                                                   |
| 19:07      | But the trick is, is it will only be populated with the music that is on your iPhone or on             |
| 19:13      | your iPad, which means for those of us who prefer to stream the music on our devices,                  |
| 19:17      | it is not going to have everything available the same way that you would usually.                      |
| 19:22      | One point, I did manage to create a smart playlist for all of my music.                                |
| 19:26      | And this is what I mentioned before, where I then I have that.                                         |
| 19:29      | This actually still works on my iPhone, but I haven't managed to recreate this since.                  |
| 19:34      | And so I would really like for our lessons to let me know whether or not they can do                   |
| 19:37      | this.                                                                                                  |
| 19:38      | But I created this smart playlist called all music.                                                    |
| 19:41      | And then on my on my iPhone, it did show me everything that was not on my iPhone as                    |
| 19:46      | well as the stuff that was on my iPhone.                                                               |
| 19:48      | And then I could just hit the download button and that went ahead and it seemed to work.               |
| 19:52      | It took a very long time to download a lot of music turned out I had to limit it because               |
| 19:56      | I was trying to download too much.                                                                     |
| 19:59      | It seemed to work.                                                                                     |
| 20:00      | I am glad that Apple has left all these hooks in though.                                               |
| 20:04      | So you know, the music app is just as automation friendly as iTunes was in that regard.                |
| 20:11      | And that's good.                                                                                       |
| 20:12      | Yes, it is.                                                                                            |
| 20:13      | And if you find any old AppleScripts for iTunes and you want to update them to work                   |
| 20:17      | for music, then you usually just need to replace the word iTunes with music.                           |
| 20:22      | And there's more information out there on Doug's site if you want to change something else.               |
| 20:26      | So where are you bringing in automated music on your Mac?                                              |
| 20:31      | I am primarily bringing in by having it connected to some Keyboard Maestro Stream Deck actions.        |
| 20:39      | So we recently talked about how I wasn't using the Stream Deck as much as I wanted to.                 |
| 20:44      | But I've got it.                                                                                       |
| 20:45      | I had it posted to me because I'm in the UK and my stuff is in Australia.                              |
| 20:48      | But along with some other necessary items, I had the Stream Deck put in a box for me.                  |
| 20:53      | And I've now got that set up.                                                                          |
| 20:55      | And that is really nice.                                                                               |
| 20:56      | You know, I'm there in the mornings and I hit button and it, you know, rearranges some                 |
| 21:00      | things on my machine and it starts playing music.                                                      |
| 21:02      | And I really like that when I was in the office, people would usually play the radio.                  |
| 21:06      | So there would be something, you know, happening at work.                                              |
| 21:08      | And now we, we, I have music.                                                                          |
| 21:10      | So I'm, I'm enjoying that.                                                                             |
| 21:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 21:13      | There's several ways to trigger music on your Mac.                                                     |
| 21:15      | And if you use [[LaunchBar]] or [[Alfred]], those are great apps that have great hooks into                    |
| 21:20      | your music library so you can, you know, kick off a music playlist with just a few clicks              |
| 21:25      | of the keyboard.                                                                                       |
| 21:26      | I do that.                                                                                             |
| 21:27      | I'm using [[Alfred]] these days.                                                                           |
| 21:28      | I keep jumping between them, but I've got the plugin in [[Alfred]] where I can kick off                    |
| 21:32      | a playlist very quickly with a keyboard.                                                               |
| 21:35      | But I think for true automation type stuff where I do this and that happens, I think                   |
| 21:41      | there's no easier tool than, than a Keyboard Maestro.                                                  |
| 21:45      | You can also do them via AppleScript, but Keyboard Maestro has already kind of got the                |
| 21:50      | components in it to do it without having to fiddle around with AppleScript.                           |
| 21:54      | So that's where I do it too.                                                                           |
| 21:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 21:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 21:57      | I'm a really big fan of Keyboard Maestro.                                                              |
| 21:59      | Just like you, I also have the [[Alfred]] plugin, but I found myself not really using it.                  |
| 22:03      | The only other thing that I have tried, which is BetterTouchTool, you can, it can control            |
| 22:10      | the touch bar on a touch bar device.                                                                   |
| 22:14      | One of the many things that it can do is it can put the, the information about the currently           |
| 22:18      | playing track in there.                                                                                |
| 22:20      | And I'm not going to say that's necessarily an automation is more of a, a fun hack slash               |
| 22:24      | tool, um, but it's, it's great fun and BetterTouchTool is definitely an automation tool.             |
| 22:29      | So you can, you can call yourself an automator, even if you only use it to do that.                    |
| 22:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:33      | We just covered BetterTouchTool over on Mac power user yourself.                                     |
| 22:36      | You're interested in that one.                                                                         |
| 22:37      | There's a whole episode on it over there.                                                              |
| 22:38      | And we'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.                                                |
| 22:42      | This episode of the automators is brought to you by TextExpander from Smile, unlock                   |

| 22:54      | typing because that's a place we all waste a lot of time.                                              |

| 23:02      | TextExpander lifts you instantly, inserts snippets of text as you type using a quick                  |
| 23:07      | search or abbreviation.                                                                                |
| 23:09      | If you type something more than three times, make it a snippet and let TextExpander type              |
| 23:13      | it for you.                                                                                            |

| 23:20      | And if you want to learn more about TextExpander, they do interesting webinars every month.           |
| 23:24      | I just did one for them a few months ago.                                                              |

| 23:41      | The thing I love about TextExpander is it is the automator tool choice for text expansion             |
| 23:47      | because it does so much more with TextExpander, you can automatically insert the date or you          |
| 23:52      | can insert the contents of your clipboard.                                                             |
| 23:55      | You can have it type in keystrokes like the tab key, which is essential.                               |
| 23:59      | Like I do emails all the time with TextExpander and I write the TextExpander snippet in the          |
| 24:03      | subject line and TextExpander will then fill in the subject line using the current date               |
| 24:09      | and month, then it'll hit the tab key, and then it'll grab the person's name, the recipient's          |
| 24:15      | name from the email because it's using an AppleScript because you can do that with                    |
| 24:18      | TextExpander.                                                                                         |
| 24:20      | And then it'll hit the carriage return and type the email for me.                                      |
| 24:22      | It does all of this work, making automation just just golden when you use TextExpander.               |

| 24:50      | Our thanks to TextExpander for the support of this show and all of relay FM.                          |
| 24:56      | So I think we've covered the Mac pretty thoroughly there, David.                                       |
| 24:59      | I mean, all things considered, there's a lot more that we could dive into, especially when             |
| 25:03      | it comes to AppleScript and smart playlists, you can really go nuts.                                  |
| 25:07      | But I think we should take a look at iOS now.                                                          |
| 25:09      | Yeah, we do, because it's a totally different ball game over there.                                    |
| 25:12      | It is because until, you know, iOS 13, we didn't even have a way to automatically trigger              |
| 25:17      | things when something else happens.                                                                    |
| 25:19      | And I must confess, well, the first things I did when we got automations in iOS 13, which              |
| 25:25      | is why I was so devastated when they took it away as part of the beta, that I added                    |
| 25:30      | automatically playing music when my alarm gets turned off in the morning.                              |
| 25:35      | And that has been a game changer.                                                                      |
| 25:37      | I really like that.                                                                                    |
| 25:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 25:39      | I think just getting music started on your mobile device, it's just such an obvious automation.        |
| 25:44      | You know, it's something that everybody wants to do.                                                   |
| 25:47      | We all like music and why not have music play when you walk into your house or you turn                |
| 25:51      | off your alarm in the morning.                                                                         |
| 25:53      | And this is all really simple stuff that you can really impress people with without a lot              |
| 25:59      | of work.                                                                                               |
| 26:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:01      | And I have to say, I am looking at getting a car at some point in the not too distant                  |
| 26:04      | future and I'm requiring car play for myself simply because I want to be able to connect               |
| 26:09      | my phone to car play and have it automatically start playing my driving playlist.                      |
| 26:12      | I do already have a driving playlist because I already have a driver's license, but I just             |
| 26:17      | the ability to automate things like that and have music automatically play at the appropriate          |
| 26:22      | times.                                                                                                 |
| 26:23      | That is for me, an absolute game-changing feature and I really enjoy it.                               |
| 26:28      | Well, you want to start by talking about some of the shortcuts, music automation that you've           |
| 26:32      | got available?                                                                                         |
| 26:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:34      | So I mean, the first place to start is, of course, inside the automation tab and just                  |
| 26:38      | looking inside of those personal automations, you know, like when might you want to start              |
| 26:42      | playing music?                                                                                         |
| 26:43      | So for me, the key ones are when I stop my alarm in the morning or when I snooze my alarm              |
| 26:47      | in the morning, when I start a workout on my Apple Watch and car play, I've been driving               |
| 26:52      | another car that has car play as well.                                                                 |
| 26:55      | But another one has been airplane mode and airplane mode is great because when I put                   |
| 27:00      | airplane mode on, that's nearly always because I'm on a plane and that means I have headphones         |
| 27:05      | and I'm going to want to listen to music.                                                              |
| 27:07      | Now I should note for the airplane mode one, I do turn the volume down a long way just                 |
| 27:11      | in case my headphones aren't connected.                                                                |
| 27:12      | I should probably find a way to check whether or not the Bluetooth is connected there before           |
| 27:16      | I do that.                                                                                             |
| 27:17      | But, you know, it's just great to be able to automatically play music when I do those                  |
| 27:24      | things.                                                                                                |
| 27:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 27:26      | So when it comes to the actual music triggers or I'm sorry, music actions you've got in                |
| 27:31      | shortcuts, there's a lot.                                                                              |
| 27:33      | I mean, the most, the one I use the most is just to play music shortcut.                               |
| 27:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 27:37      | It'll play music and you can choose from an artist or from a playlist or, you know, whatever.          |
| 27:42      | But, you know, 90% of the time, my music automation action is play a specific playlist.                |
| 27:49      | And I just make playlists around things I want to happen through automation.                           |
| 27:53      | Mm-hmm.                                                                                                |
| 27:54      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 27:55      | So that's something that I have been trying to get away from a little bit because I found              |
| 27:59      | if I'm left to my own devices, which right now most of us are to some extent on our own                |
| 28:04      | simply because of the changes in the world, I will listen to the same music again and                  |
| 28:09      | again and again.                                                                                       |
| 28:11      | And there's only so many times that you can hear the first and two soundtrack before people            |
| 28:15      | start to go a little bit insane.                                                                       |
| 28:16      | You might not, but other people may get upset with you.                                                |
| 28:20      | And so what I have been doing is I've been trying the get playlist from library action                 |
| 28:26      | in toolbox pro and I am attempting to build a shortcut right now.                                      |
| 28:29      | I don't quite have it working the way I think it should be working.                                    |
| 28:32      | So I'm going to ask the developer for a little bit of help there, but you can get all of               |
| 28:36      | your playlists from here.                                                                              |
| 28:38      | And then you could just pick a random one from the list using the list feature.                        |
| 28:42      | And then I'm hoping that I can then just play that music, but at the moment the playing                |
| 28:47      | isn't working and I've done something wrong there, I'm sure of it.                                     |
| 28:50      | But if I can get that working, I'm going to put that in the show notes.                                |
| 28:54      | Another way you could do, make it less repetitive is you could on the fly find music.                  |
| 29:00      | And if you've got certain artists you like, you could do like a choose from list.                      |
| 29:05      | And then you could have some of your favourite artists and then you could pick, let's say               |
| 29:09      | I'll say Miles Davis and then it could do a search for artists is Miles Davis and then                 |
| 29:15      | start playing music.                                                                                   |
| 29:17      | When I've done experiments with that, Miles in particular is hard to do that with because              |
| 29:21      | he had so many different phases in his career that some of his music I really like and some            |
| 29:26      | of it isn't, I'm not as big of a fan of it.                                                            |
| 29:29      | So it, you know, then it pulls the wrong, you know, it'll pull the, you know, his drug                 |
| 29:33      | induced, you know, yeah, I'm like, I don't want to listen to this right now.                           |
| 29:38      | But the, but you can, you can also, in addition to just grabbing an existing playlist, I guess         |
| 29:43      | my point is you can have it search your library, the downside, as Rose mentioned earlier in            |
| 29:48      | the show is it's got to be downloaded in your, to your library and your device in order                |
| 29:52      | for it to show up.                                                                                     |
| 29:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:55      | And that is unfortunate, but at the same time there are, you know, ways that you can                   |
| 30:00      | work around this, but, you know, I mentioned before, if you create a smart playlist and                |
| 30:05      | you, you set it so that it should just contain all of your music, then that should at the              |
| 30:10      | very least theoretically sing over to your iPhone so you can just hit the download button              |
| 30:15      | once you've opened it.                                                                                 |
| 30:16      | Of course, depending on the side of your library, this may take a very long time or even be            |
| 30:19      | impossible to download the music, but you could also filter that to be, for example,                   |
| 30:25      | your most listened to things or your least listened to things depending on your preference.            |
| 30:30      | And then you have that available as a playlist that you can choose from inside of shortcuts.           |
| 30:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:34      | There's also a lot of playlist management tools available to you in shortcuts.                         |
| 30:38      | You can create a playlist, you can add music to a playlist.                                            |
| 30:41      | I've thought about trying to write a shortcut to incorporate a song that I hear into a specified       |
| 30:50      | playlist.                                                                                              |
| 30:51      | You know, they do have that feature now where you can ask Siri, you know, what is the song?            |
| 30:56      | And that was added to shortcuts recently.                                                              |
| 30:59      | So have it, like if I'm walking around, listen to something, grab the name of it, download             |
| 31:04      | it and save it to a like a recently discovered playlist and then I can go back and listen              |
| 31:10      | to those.                                                                                              |
| 31:11      | Yeah, that's very doable.                                                                              |
| 31:12      | I actually, I think I already have a shortcut for that.                                                |
| 31:16      | So I will dig that out and put that in the show notes because that is another useful                   |
| 31:19      | one.                                                                                                   |
| 31:21      | You know, I'm frequently or at least used to hear songs and I would want to save this                  |
| 31:26      | for later so that I can listen to it again.                                                            |
| 31:30      | And that's something that you, you know, a lot of people want to do.                                   |
| 31:34      | They want to, you know, maybe hearing it again at home.                                                |
| 31:37      | You don't like it as much as you did when you were out or maybe you like it better.                    |
| 31:39      | But, you know, being able to add that to your music library is a great idea.                           |
| 31:46      | Well, I mean, it's just kind of like an OmniFocus inbox.                                               |
| 31:50      | It's, you know, you're capturing the idea or the song, but you may decide later, is                    |
| 31:56      | this something I want?                                                                                 |
| 31:57      | Is this something I'm going to move into a specific playlist?                                          |
| 32:00      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 32:01      | We'll see.                                                                                             |
| 32:02      | That's a relatively new option with the ability to capture the music.                                  |
| 32:06      | So I, as soon as I saw that it came out, I kind of put it in the back of my head, but                  |
| 32:10      | I just haven't got around to building that one yet.                                                    |
| 32:13      | And it's not a difficult shortcut.                                                                     |
| 32:14      | Yes, it isn't.                                                                                         |
| 32:16      | And it's, it's one of these things.                                                                    |
| 32:18      | Those are the very simple one and two action shortcuts that you can use just playing music             |
| 32:23      | or adding something, you know, listening to something and adding it to a playlist where                |
| 32:26      | you could get much more complicated.                                                                   |
| 32:28      | And this is something I created for, I think it was Bodie Quirk, at Macstock, an Automator's                |
| 32:35      | fan last year, and so we met at Macstock and he showed me this shortcut that he was trying               |
| 32:41      | to make and he explained the difficulties that he was having with it.                                  |
| 32:45      | Essentially he wanted to be able to just select an album and play it, but he didn't want               |
| 32:50      | to be dealing with the music interface.                                                                |
| 32:52      | He wanted to be able to control everything from the widget.                                            |
| 32:54      | Now, the widget for music is okay, but it's not great for something like this.                         |
| 32:59      | And so, and he also wanted just a limited selection of artists available to him.                       |
| 33:05      | And so what I did is I actually created, I think in the end it worked out as three shortcuts.          |
| 33:11      | And the first one, you set it up so that you have all of the different artists available               |
| 33:14      | to you.                                                                                                |
| 33:15      | And then the second one will update all of the albums for those artists.                               |
| 33:19      | So if you have the Beatles, it will go through and find all of the different Beatles albums            |
| 33:24      | that you have.                                                                                         |
| 33:25      | Now, this is based on your music library.                                                              |
| 33:27      | And then the last one will allow you to pick an album, pick an artist and then pick an                 |
| 33:32      | album for them.                                                                                        |
| 33:33      | And that's it.                                                                                         |
| 33:34      | And that's all it does.                                                                                |
| 33:35      | And then it plays it, of course.                                                                       |
| 33:38      | And it's set to play all the music, not shuffled and not repeating, because usually if you             |
| 33:42      | want to listen to an album, you want to listen to the story that the artist has set up for             |
| 33:46      | the album.                                                                                             |
| 33:47      | But that's a really nice series of shortcuts.                                                          |
| 33:49      | It is three shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 33:50      | I would probably have condensed it into one, but I wanted you to be able to update the                 |
| 33:54      | albums without having to go ahead and then play one of them or trying to kill the shortcut             |
| 34:00      | while you were in the middle of updating.                                                              |
| 34:02      | And once again, they have to be downloaded.                                                            |
| 34:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:06      | These things usually need to be downloaded for them to work because that's how music                   |
| 34:09      | on iOS works.                                                                                          |
| 34:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:12      | It's a shame, but it's an understandable limitation.                                                   |
| 34:15      | So the triggers I use like you is the alarm clock one is great, although for me, it just               |
| 34:21      | varies every day.                                                                                      |
| 34:24      | And because I got someone sleeping in the bed next to me, I don't like to make a lot                   |
| 34:28      | of noise as I get up.                                                                                  |
| 34:31      | But I do like the idea of a music trigger in the morning.                                              |
| 34:35      | So I've been kind of experimenting with that.                                                          |
| 34:38      | And because my time is so regulated now, I've been trying to look at a time-based trigger.             |
| 34:44      | But then I worry, you know, I'm going to be like still in the bedroom and wake up my wife              |
| 34:48      | and I don't like getting in trouble.                                                                   |
| 34:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:52      | That's something you do need to be aware of with these music automations.                              |
| 34:55      | Suddenly playing, you know, a death metal soundtrack is probably not going to endear                   |
| 34:58      | you to your other half if they're not expecting it.                                                    |
| 35:01      | If they're expecting it and they're cool with it, then that's okay.                                    |
| 35:04      | But otherwise, there are other options available to you.                                               |
| 35:08      | How did you know my alarm is death metal?                                                              |
| 35:10      | I don't know, David.                                                                                   |
| 35:11      | I just get the impression that that would certainly wake you up in the mornings.                       |
| 35:14      | Smooth jazz might send you back to sleep.                                                              |
| 35:16      | Oh, no, smooth jazz would make me vomit.                                                               |
| 35:20      | Well, there we go.                                                                                     |
| 35:23      | It certainly wouldn't help you get up in the morning.                                                  |
| 35:26      | When I got married, I had the DJ I wrote in the contract that if she played a single                   |
| 35:30      | Kenny G song, she didn't get paid.                                                                     |
| 35:35      | This ladies and gentlemen is why you may not want to work, do a gig for a lawyer, but there            |
| 35:40      | we go.                                                                                                 |
| 35:41      | I'm sure it was fine.                                                                                  |
| 35:42      | Did she get paid?                                                                                      |
| 35:43      | No, I joked with her about that, but I also was serious.                                               |
| 35:48      | The mystery is yet to be solved.                                                                       |
| 35:54      | All right, so I do think that the trick for automation, at least starting on iOS is shortcuts,         |
| 36:01      | but there are some apps as well that give you some interesting automation tools on your                |
| 36:07      | iPhone and iPad.                                                                                       |
| 36:08      | There are.                                                                                             |
| 36:09      | I'm not talking about those.                                                                           |
| 36:10      | So one of the apps that I have been experimenting with recently is called Miximum.                     |
| 36:15      | That's not me mispronouncing something.                                                                |
| 36:17      | That's really what it's called.                                                                        |
| 36:18      | It's like maximum, but with mix at the start instead of max.                                           |
| 36:23      | And this allows you to create smart playlists the same way that you would in iTunes pretty             |
| 36:27      | much, but it's well, it's on your iPhone.                                                              |
| 36:31      | So that means that if you are, for example, on a plane and you want to create a new mix,               |
| 36:36      | then you can go ahead and do that.                                                                     |
| 36:37      | And you can specify sources and then after you specified your sources and sources are                  |
| 36:43      | the playlists available to you as well as you could say all songs and just your library.               |
| 36:49      | And then you can go ahead and create rules and there are groups of rules as well.                      |
| 36:55      | And you can add as many different groups as you like.                                                  |
| 36:58      | And this has been really useful for, I just want like, I don't know, 15 tracks of something            |
| 37:02      | because these ones will update on your device when you reopen the app, which is why I really           |
| 37:07      | like them because the smart playlists don't always update.                                             |
| 37:10      | And especially if I'm offline, I find they really don't update.                                        |
| 37:13      | So I've been using Miximum a lot and I'm really liking it, I have to say.                              |
| 37:18      | Yeah, I tried that out in preparation for the show.                                                    |
| 37:21      | It's nice.                                                                                             |
| 37:22      | I am not happy about their iPad implementation because there is none.                                  |
| 37:26      | I hadn't seen an app in a long time that loaded on my iPad as a iPhone app, you know, where            |
| 37:31      | it's got the small screen.                                                                             |
| 37:33      | But it does.                                                                                           |
| 37:35      | Come on, guys.                                                                                         |
| 37:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 37:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 37:38      | So I use this one on my iPhone.                                                                        |
| 37:39      | I really listen to music on my iPad actually.                                                          |
| 37:41      | Do you listen to music on your iPad a lot, David?                                                      |
| 37:43      | All the time.                                                                                          |
| 37:44      | All the time.                                                                                          |
| 37:45      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 37:46      | I mean, I've got music playing, music or white noise playing almost 100% of the time.                  |
| 37:53      | I have a thing with my ears where I always hear ringing.                                               |
| 37:56      | So I'd like to have something to replace it.                                                           |
| 37:58      | So when I'm sitting on my iPad, the speakers on the iPad Pro are amazing.                              |
| 38:03      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 38:04      | There's a lot of music there, if I'm in a room with the HomePod in it, I may send it                   |
| 38:07      | to the HomePod, but I'm just as likely to play it on the iPad.                                         |
| 38:10      | So I do like those tools available.                                                                    |
| 38:14      | There's another one that I tried as we were prepping for the show called [[Marvis]], M-A-R-V-I-S.          |
| 38:21      | It's similar to [[Miximum]], you know, it's got an alternative music interface.                            |
| 38:26      | I haven't decided if it's better or worse than the [[Apple Music]] interface, but it is                    |
| 38:32      | simpler, I would say for certain.                                                                      |
| 38:35      | But it also gives you the ability to use a seemingly unlimited number of smart rules                   |
| 38:40      | to make custom playlists based on the music it's got, you know, and both of these apps,                |
| 38:45      | you have to give them access to your music library when you first install them.                        |
| 38:48      | So assuming, as long as it's downloaded, it can fall into a very cryptic set of rules                  |
| 38:54      | that you create.                                                                                       |
| 38:55      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 38:56      | And I, trying them both, I felt like they both kind of scratch the edge.                               |
| 38:59      | If you want the ability to create your own smart playlists on your iPhone or iPad, Marvis              |
| 39:07      | or Miximum will work.                                                                                  |
| 39:08      | If you're going to do an iPad, I'd probably recommend Marvis simply because they actually              |
| 39:11      | have an iPad interface, but they're both fully adequate for the job.                                   |
| 39:17      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 39:18      | And one of the things I really like about Miximum, I don't know if this also is available              |
| 39:22      | in Marvis David, you'll have to let us know, is I can specify that it should only use downloaded       |
| 39:26      | music in this playlist because it appears that it can usually grab hold of this, of                    |
| 39:32      | all the other music.                                                                                   |
| 39:34      | But of course, if you're going offline and you're listening to it, I find if I'm offline               |
| 39:38      | and I'm listening to music and it tries to play something that's not downloaded to my                  |
| 39:41      | phone, it will play through the length of the track silently.                                          |
| 39:45      | I have no idea what's going on there.                                                                  |
| 39:47      | I have filed this as feedback because that is just, you know, you're there and then it                 |
| 39:51      | starts playing Bohemian Rhapsody, but Bohemian Rhapsody isn't downloaded, which first of               |
| 39:55      | all is a significant problem because I quite like Bohemian Rhapsody.                                   |
| 39:58      | And secondly, it's five and a half minutes of silence.                                                 |
| 40:01      | And you start to wonder if you've gone crazy.                                                          |
| 40:02      | It plays the length of the song.                                                                       |
| 40:04      | It seems to, yeah.                                                                                     |
| 40:06      | I mean, usually I realise in like a minute or something that something's up and then                   |
| 40:11      | I skip to the next song, but it's certainly like, it's long enough for me to notice and                |
| 40:16      | get very confused and the play bar is progressing across the screen whenever I look at it.             |
| 40:21      | It's very strange.                                                                                     |
| 40:23      | So often it depends on my mood, but quite often on airplanes, I just put on [[Dark Noise]]                 |
| 40:28      | and listen to a thunderstorm.                                                                          |
| 40:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 40:31      | But I download, I'm very religious about downloading tracks before I go on a trip.                     |
| 40:36      | In fact, it's like on my OmniFocus project template for going on a trip is download the                |
| 40:41      | music because I just, there's nothing worse than getting on a plane and realising you've               |
| 40:47      | only got two Dexter Gordon songs on your phone.                                                        |
| 40:50      | That's just, that's the worst.                                                                         |
| 40:52      | And this is apparently a problem that you've had more than one, David.                                 |
| 40:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 40:57      | Well, not anymore because I've learned my lesson.                                                      |

| 42:43      | So Rose, let's talk a little bit about the ways we're implementing all these tools to                  |
| 42:48      | bring automation to our lives and how we automate our music.                                           |
| 42:53      | You've got any cool shortcuts or Mac-based automations you want to share?                              |
| 42:57      | Well, I mean, the first thing that I started with is buying more HomePods because of course            |
| 43:01      | the solution to any problems involving music is HomePods breeding like tribbles, apparently.           |
| 43:06      | So I have a pair of HomePods now, and this has been great because one of the things that               |
| 43:11      | I have built into my life, or at least that I was using a lot before, I'm using it a little            |
| 43:16      | bit less now, is when I got home from work, as well as stopping my commuting, time-tracking            |
| 43:21      | timer, my phone would also ask me if I wanted to send what I'm listening to to my HomePods,            |
| 43:28      | start playing music on my HomePods, or pause what I'm listening to, and it would just give             |
| 43:32      | me those three options so that I could then pick what it was I wanted to do.                           |
| 43:38      | And that, for me, was really helpful because I just said play music, and I had a very large            |
| 43:43      | playlist and I was playing it on shuffle, so that I would hopefully get to listen to something         |
| 43:49      | a little bit less repetitive than the Frozen 2 soundtrack, which I have to say is a great              |
| 43:53      | soundtrack.                                                                                            |
| 43:54      | I really love it, but apparently other people disagree, they're lost.                                  |
| 43:58      | I think it's great too.                                                                                |
| 43:59      | There's some great lyrics in those songs.                                                              |
| 44:01      | Yeah, and especially, you know, the video of the love song, that was hilarious, absolutely             |
| 44:09      | loved it, but either way, you know, that for me was great because it would start then playing          |
| 44:15      | music on my HomePods, and the HomePods are really great because you can hand off playback              |
| 44:19      | to any AirPlay 2 speaker with your iPhone and shortcuts, and you can either hand it                    |
| 44:25      | off the playback, or you can set it as your playback destination.                                      |
| 44:28      | Handing off the playback means that then your speakers will be, you know, playing by themselves        |
| 44:33      | without your phone necessarily doing anything, whereas setting the playback destination retains        |
| 44:37      | the control, and that for me was really nice.                                                          |
| 44:42      | And I'm still using my HomePods, I'm just using that particular shortcut a little less                 |
| 44:45      | at the moment, but that's okay.                                                                        |
| 44:48      | Just on that love song in the Frozen 2, have you ever listened to Chicago?                             |
| 44:54      | I have not, no.                                                                                        |
| 44:56      | Okay, you should get some out of Chicago playlist to your, the band Chicago, not the musical,          |
| 45:04      | because that total ripoff of their music, but anyway, see, I feel old sharing that with                |
| 45:10      | you, but I figure I gotta share the love too, but like you, I think the HomePods, although             |
| 45:15      | I know a lot of folks are not huge HomePod fans, they're overpriced, and the voice assistant           |
| 45:22      | isn't always as useful as she should be, and sometimes she jumps in conversations too quickly.         |
| 45:30      | But if you like music and you like automation, they are amazing for music automation, because          |
| 45:35      | shortcuts has abilities to push music to them, and you can have, you know, great playlist              |
| 45:40      | playing for you all over your house.                                                                   |
| 45:42      | Yes, yes, you can.                                                                                     |
| 45:44      | And that's something, you know, I'm looking at getting some of the IKEA speakers, because              |
| 45:48      | they are, you know, they're working with Sonos now, but they have AirPlay 2 support as well.           |
| 45:55      | And I'm thinking that a pair of those on the bedside tables would be a great, cheap alternative        |
| 45:59      | to yet more HomePods in my life, but that would be a great place to start with music                   |
| 46:03      | in the mornings, which, you know, is something that I really enjoy, you know, having some              |
| 46:07      | music in the morning helps me get up and get out of bed.                                               |
| 46:10      | Of course, it has to be the right kind of music, so less death metal, but it's okay.                   |
| 46:16      | So for me, music, the automation story for music for me has really altered over the years.             |
| 46:22      | Years ago, my automation fund was creating very Byzantine style smart playlists, you                   |
| 46:29      | know, like I talked about at the top of the show, you can still do that in Apple music.                |
| 46:33      | But for me now, it's been more about automating different types of music for different contexts        |
| 46:41      | or types of work I'm doing.                                                                            |
| 46:43      | So many of my shortcuts now have a play music step in them.                                            |
| 46:48      | You can always turn it off, but I find that I usually leave them on.                                   |
| 46:51      | And so I'm doing kind of the labor work of putting together playlists that are appropriate.            |
| 46:56      | Like what's the perfect playlist for doing an OmniFocus review?                                        |
| 46:59      | I mean, for me, that's different from you and everybody's got their own kind of thing.                 |
| 47:04      | And you know, you put that playlist in, you have it play random and just show up and say,              |
| 47:09      | okay, I'm going to do an OmniFocus review so it may kick off a timer, open up OmniFocus                |
| 47:15      | to the review tab and start a music playlist.                                                          |
| 47:18      | And I have that playlist creeping into all sorts of different things I do.                             |
| 47:25      | And I really find it nice that way because I like the automation of it.                                |
| 47:30      | And it does make doing that task more fun for me.                                                      |
| 47:36      | Some things I do, I really can't listen to music.                                                      |
| 47:38      | I was thinking when, earlier when I talked about how I use [[Dark Noise]] a lot, [[Dark Noise]]                |
| 47:44      | is what I do when I need to use my brain.                                                              |
| 47:47      | Because like when I listen to Dexter Gordon, I get hung up on his solos and start listening            |
| 47:52      | to his articulation and then all of a sudden I'm not doing my work.                                    |
| 47:55      | So like I'll use kind of the white noise generation for brain work, but for busy work, I like music.   |
| 48:02      | And I've really done a good job.                                                                       |
| 48:03      | I've got many of my context shortcuts or context automations that include playing music.               |
| 48:11      | So that's kind of where it is for me now.                                                              |
| 48:13      | But the actual generating the playlist of what plays from those, those are manually curated            |
| 48:19      | by me at this point or, and we haven't really mentioned it on the show, but if you have                |
| 48:24      | an Apple Music subscription, there are great playlists curated by other people.                        |
| 48:29      | And you can download those very easily.                                                                |
| 48:31      | So whatever your favourite artist or type of music is, you type it in and there's a bunch               |
| 48:35      | of available playlists for you.                                                                        |
| 48:37      | And I just pick one of those.                                                                          |
| 48:39      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 48:40      | And that is a great way to find new music to listen to.                                                |
| 48:42      | I have to say the Friends Mix is something that I've really been enjoying getting some                 |
| 48:46      | some interesting different music into my playlist every week.                                          |
| 48:49      | There that said, I'm not 100% certain Phil Schiller actually listens to everything that                |
| 48:53      | ends up in my Friends Mix because you can add Phil Schiller on Apple Music.                            |
| 48:57      | But there's always some interesting stuff in there.                                                    |
| 49:00      | So it's worth looking at.                                                                              |
| 49:03      | And the big caveat there is you have to download it.                                                   |
| 49:07      | If you see a playlist you like, maybe you just listen to it stream wants to make sure                  |
| 49:12      | it's a it's a winner.                                                                                  |
| 49:13      | But once you decide that hit the hit, go hit the download all button because everything                |
| 49:18      | breaks if you don't have a download.                                                                   |
| 49:19      | Yeah, yeah, it does, which is a shame.                                                                 |
| 49:22      | I've been trying to work on an automation to improve my background music.                              |
| 49:26      | So I do like listening to white noise, but I find for many things classical music is                   |
| 49:31      | perfect.                                                                                               |
| 49:32      | However, anything that has singing and distracts me for similar reasons to you, you know, like         |
| 49:39      | what are they saying?                                                                                  |
| 49:40      | My brain will translate it or attempt to translate it occasionally involving in some very weird        |
| 49:45      | conversations that I have with myself in my head because I mistranslated a word or something.          |
| 49:51      | So I try to avoid any music with singing in, but that is in some cases easier than others,             |
| 49:58      | especially when, you know, the artist of the piece is not set to the composer.                         |
| 50:03      | It's set to the orchestra leader or, you know, anything else, you know, if it's got, if you            |
| 50:13      | know that the person, the artist is a singer, then of course it's easy to exclude.                     |
| 50:17      | So I've been working on just excluding those from a smart playlist and because I'm listening           |
| 50:21      | to this on my Mac, it's very simple.                                                                   |
| 50:23      | I've actually been using [[Alfred]] to simply change the rating from five stars to four                    |
| 50:27      | stars.                                                                                                 |
| 50:28      | Now, this is the one place where I am using a five and a four star rating.                             |
| 50:30      | If I don't like the piece of music, I will just delete it.                                             |
| 50:34      | But for everything else, I change it from five star to four star.                                      |
| 50:36      | Five stars means it's great and there's no singing.                                                    |
| 50:39      | Four stars means it's great in this thing.                                                             |
| 50:41      | And that's my differentiator there.                                                                    |
| 50:43      | And then that moves it out of the playlist.                                                            |
| 50:45      | I've actually had to set it up so that what it will do is select the track, skip ahead                 |
| 50:51      | to the next track and then mark the selected track as four stars because if you skip the               |
| 50:56      | track that you're currently on or you change its rating, which will then mean that it disappears       |
| 51:00      | from the playlist, then it just pauses and you have to hit play again.                                 |
| 51:05      | So I've been working around that.                                                                      |
| 51:07      | Well, just for giggles, I've been doing like interval training for my ears, like what's                |
| 51:12      | a minor third or a seventh or whatever.                                                                |
| 51:14      | And so even listening to classical music now screws me up because I start doing intervals              |
| 51:19      | when I listen to it.                                                                                   |
| 51:21      | But the point of all this is you get playlist together, you can trigger them so we're easy             |
| 51:26      | on your iOS device.                                                                                    |
| 51:28      | Why not incorporate that into different things you do and give it a try?                               |
| 51:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 51:33      | And I highly recommend that.                                                                           |
| 51:34      | And if you've got Keyboard Maestro macros that you use to set up things on your Mac for                |
| 51:38      | different parts of your day, then I would highly recommend putting some music playback                 |
| 51:41      | in there as well because that's just a game changer.                                                   |
| 51:45      | You can even do it with setups like I talk about setups that I do on my Mac or set up                  |
| 51:49      | for legal writing or set up for email.                                                                 |
| 51:52      | You can have it automatically start a playlist very easily with that.                                  |
| 51:56      | Moving on from music and playlist, we have a new segment called ask the automators and                 |
| 52:01      | we've been getting some fun questions.                                                                 |
| 52:03      | We got one this month too.                                                                             |
| 52:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 52:06      | And we picked this one actually out of our forums.                                                     |
| 52:08      | And there was somebody that who is asking, how can we create a time tracking report from               |
| 52:12      | our calendar?                                                                                          |
| 52:13      | Now, in this particular case, they were specifying that they wanted to do it from Google Calendar      |
| 52:17      | and they were using the different colours of the different events in Google Calendar.                   |
| 52:21      | And I did some pretty intense digging and the only way that I found that you might be                  |
| 52:24      | able to do that exact solution would be to use the JavaScript automation that you can                  |
| 52:30      | use with Google.                                                                                       |
| 52:32      | But it's not going to be easy to do.                                                                   |
| 52:34      | However, if you just want to create a score.                                                           |
| 52:36      | Hey, that's going to break.                                                                            |
| 52:37      | It's going to break at some point, but if you just want to create a report of the hours                |
| 52:41      | allocated in your day based on different calendars and things, David and I've got quite a few          |
| 52:45      | ideas for you.                                                                                         |
| 52:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 52:47      | I think probably the easiest is to break up the categories by calendar and then you can                |
| 52:53      | make a report pretty easily.                                                                           |
| 52:55      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 52:56      | Yes, you can.                                                                                          |
| 52:57      | And this has actually led me recently to create multiple calendars.                                    |
| 53:02      | So originally for my time blocking, I had just the one time blocking calendar and that                 |
| 53:06      | was great.                                                                                             |
| 53:07      | And then I realised that there are some things that are recurring events, for example, preparing       |
| 53:11      | for the automator shows or preparing the shows for release and things like that that need              |
| 53:16      | to go into my calendars, but I don't necessarily want to be blocking your time.                        |
| 53:20      | And so that means I can't put them on the automators calendar, but I would like to see                 |
| 53:23      | that these are regularly scheduled and that they are automators related.                               |
| 53:28      | So I now have multiple time tracking calendars for time blocking.                                      |
| 53:32      | And this is useful because now I have automators time blocking and nested folders time blocking        |
| 53:36      | and I also have a general time blocking calendar, which is for pretty much everything else.            |
| 53:42      | It's not associated with one of those two.                                                             |
| 53:44      | And that means that I can then pull this in and what I've been doing, I've been experimenting          |
| 53:48      | with shortcuts with this.                                                                              |
| 53:50      | So you pull in the events from today or from the last week and then you go through the                 |
| 53:54      | calendars and you go through all the events and based on the calendar, you can then say,               |
| 54:00      | okay, so if the calendar contains automators, then assign that time to automators.                     |
| 54:05      | And that has been working really well.                                                                 |
| 54:07      | Making multiple calendars is a great tool for automation in general because when you're                |
| 54:12      | creating events, it allows you to create them based on where they belong.                              |
| 54:16      | When you're like doing, we just did in the last episode, we did the daily brief and one                |
| 54:21      | of the ways I could tell myself in the morning, what's on deck for MacSparky would be to              |
| 54:26      | look at the automators calendar, the Mac Power users calendar, you know, the focus calendar            |
| 54:31      | and the MacSparky calendar and give me a report of any events that show up.                           |
| 54:35      | And those calendars for today, whereas that would not address the Spark's law calendar                 |
| 54:40      | because it's a separate calendar.                                                                      |
| 54:42      | When you start breaking them up, it just gives you way more options when you want to do reporting      |
| 54:46      | or automation.                                                                                         |
| 54:47      | Now, Rose, I was thinking about this.                                                                  |
| 54:50      | Do you use Google Calendar or do you use iCloud?                                                       |
| 54:52      | What's your calendar engine for your calendaring?                                                      |
| 54:55      | Yes, all of the above.                                                                                 |
| 54:58      | So the vast majority of my calendars are saved in iCloud, in my iCloud account and this works          |
| 55:04      | really well.                                                                                           |
| 55:05      | So there are some people that I share calendars with and for some reason, sharing the iCloud           |
| 55:11      | calendar with them, they're using Google Calendar, it just wasn't working.                             |
| 55:16      | There was something going wrong.                                                                       |
| 55:17      | I am 99% certain this was the fact that I was on a beta or multiple betas and it's now                 |
| 55:23      | since been resolved.                                                                                   |
| 55:24      | But for some calendars, what I did is I created the calendar in my Google Calendar and I shared        |
| 55:29      | it back to my iCloud and I shared it with them as well.                                                |
| 55:33      | And so some calendars are officially starting Google Calendar, but I don't actually sync               |
| 55:37      | the Google calendars to my device.                                                                     |
| 55:39      | I just sync iCloud because I share the calendars back.                                                 |
| 55:42      | And for work, I'm also using Exchange, where I have a couple of different calendars, including         |
| 55:47      | a useful little information calendar where when I clock in, automatically it goes eight                |
| 55:51      | hours forward and it adds a one minute long appointment to say go home, which is quite                 |
| 55:56      | nice.                                                                                                  |
| 55:57      | And that's not something that's visible to other people because to start with, I was                   |
| 56:01      | putting it in the main calendar and then a couple of people were like, so why do you                   |
| 56:04      | need to go home at like 17, 22?                                                                        |
| 56:07      | It's like, oh, right.                                                                                  |
| 56:08      | You can see that.                                                                                      |
| 56:09      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 56:10      | I suspected you may be all in with Google Calendar because web-based automation, I think Google        |
| 56:14      | Calendar runs circles around iCloud Calendar.                                                          |
| 56:17      | It does, but at the same time, there's actually not that much that I automate with my calendar,        |
| 56:22      | at least as it goes to having, you know, services like Zapia Watch It or something.                   |
| 56:28      | I'm pretty happy with just what I've got on my iPhone with shortcuts because I don't base              |
| 56:34      | things on when something gets added to my calendar.                                                    |
| 56:37      | I base it on what's happening today or next week as it currently stands in my calendar,                |
| 56:43      | which for me is much more useful because adding something to my calendar, so say for example,          |
| 56:47      | I'm recording a podcast tomorrow, but originally it was planned for yesterday.                         |
| 56:52      | Well, if I had something added to my OmniFocus based on it originally being planned for yesterday,     |
| 56:57      | then the due date in OmniFocus would be wrong, but moving the calendar wouldn't have updated           |
| 57:00      | my OmniFocus task.                                                                                     |
| 57:02      | So whereas as it is, I have, you know, a couple of prompts of, oh, hey, and in your recording,         |
| 57:08      | you've got these upcoming deadlines for recording, you know, are you on top of your preparation        |
| 57:13      | for this?                                                                                              |
| 57:14      | Yes or no?                                                                                             |
| 57:15      | Go add it to your OmniFocus, which works pretty well for me.                                           |
| 57:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 57:19      | I was just looking on iCloud.                                                                          |
| 57:21      | I have 16 calendars and then I have five Google calendars and then a couple others as well.            |
| 57:29      | I have a lot of calendars and I don't regret that in the least.                                        |
| 57:34      | Just over time, I've realised that, you know, calendars are free.                                      |
| 57:37      | Make as many as you need.                                                                              |
| 57:38      | And like the problem you were talking about earlier, like I have a MacSparky calendar,                |
| 57:42      | but I also have an Automators calendar.                                                                |
| 57:44      | I share the Automators calendar with you.                                                              |
| 57:46      | So anything that if we need to do show planning or show prep or recorder show, that's on that          |
| 57:51      | calendar.                                                                                              |
| 57:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 57:53      | But the prep I do alone is auto-generated through a shortcut based on the calendar and                 |
| 57:59      | then I usually block time in advance of the show and usually a little bit the week before.             |
| 58:04      | And that just shows up on the MacSparky calendar because obviously I don't need to bore you           |
| 58:08      | with the time I spend on prep.                                                                         |
| 58:11      | So you know, so all that stuff is very possible.                                                       |
| 58:13      | And as Google calendars are very automation friendly for web-based automation, if you're               |
| 58:20      | on Apple platforms, the iCloud calendars are super automation friendly for shortcuts.                  |
| 58:26      | Just like really powerful tools.                                                                       |
| 58:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 58:30      | And if you add your Google account as an account to your iPhone or iPad, then you can access           |
| 58:36      | the iCloud, the Google calendars in the same way that you can access the iCloud calendars.             |
| 58:41      | But of course, you know, there are some limitations.                                                   |
| 58:43      | So for example, the feature available in exchange, Office 365 and Google, of setting the colour         |
| 58:48      | of an event, that's not necessarily going to be available to you.                                      |
| 58:51      | But a lot of other things are.                                                                         |
| 58:53      | And the other thing that I have just thought of, which RadioColour, and that's the person               |
| 58:58      | who originally posted this in our forums may want to check out, is when an event ends.                 |
| 59:03      | If this and that can automatically detect when an event ends, and it could potentially                 |
| 59:08      | get that information, look that to a Google sheet, and that could be a game changer for                |
| 59:14      | some people.                                                                                           |
| 59:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:16      | Yeah, that would make sense.                                                                           |
| 59:18      | That's where you would want automation with web-based automation.                                      |
| 59:21      | If you want to know when a calendar event ends, then that would be where Google calendars              |
| 59:26      | definitely winner over iCloud calendar.                                                                |
| 59:29      | Although with this specific listener question, he was saying that her calendar very closely            |
| 59:34      | resembles what actually happens.                                                                       |
| 59:36      | So you could get the start and end time out with shortcuts as well.                                    |
| 59:40      | Yes, yes, you could.                                                                                   |
| 59:41      | You just can't get the colour.                                                                          |
| 59:42      | But if there were some tweaks made, I'm sure it would all work perfectly.                              |
| 59:46      | And the question starts out with she's on Google calendar, she's not on iCloud.                        |
| 59:50      | So I guess I didn't really thought about it, but if she could switch to iCloud, that may               |
| 59:54      | give you some additional options.                                                                      |
| 59:56      | Well, even if she just adds her Google account to her iPhone, then it should work.                     |

| 01:00:38   | that will send us something.                                                                           |
| 01:00:40   | My wife has no interest in this stuff.                                                                 |
| 01:00:43   | We get like a cable or something, she doesn't care.                                                    |
| 01:00:47   | The Boll and Branch sheets showed up, they gave us a pair of these, it has ruined us.                    |
| 01:00:52   | These are amazing sheets, they're so comfortable.                                                      |
| 01:00:55   | The unboxing experience is amazing, these things are packed to represent just the amazing              |
| 01:01:01   | sheets they are, but the best part is when you get them on your bed and you lay on them                |
| 01:01:04   | at night, you're like, what have I been missing my whole life?                                         |
| 01:01:08   | Boll and Branch, they're such high quality because they use organic, long staple cotton, which           |
| 01:01:13   | actually makes Boll and Branch sheets get softer over time and I can attest that's true.                 |
| 01:01:18   | And they are so soft, they're so soft that we do laundry now, we take the Boll and Branch                |
| 01:01:23   | sheets off, we launder them, we get them back on the bed that night.                                   |
| 01:01:27   | I am going to be a customer because we need more Boll and Branch sheets, they're only betting            |
| 01:01:35   | loved by three US presidents.                                                                          |

| 01:02:44   | Well, there's one more thing that we have yet to talk about today, which is what problems              |
| 01:02:49   | have we been solving recently because I have been dealing with so much paperwork and you               |
| 01:02:55   | wrote a whole book about going paperless years ago and you've got a field guide on [[Hazel]],              |
| 01:03:01   | but one of the things I was dealing with was paperwork coming at me by email, so I'm trying            |
| 01:03:06   | to find a new place to live and there was just so much and especially attachments, getting             |
| 01:03:10   | attachments out of mail, multiple attachments at a time.                                               |
| 01:03:14   | This was something I spotted in the Mac Power Users forum recently, I thought it was just              |
| 01:03:17   | neat, but it turns out if you share an attachment from a thumbnail preview on iOS to somewhere,        |
| 01:03:22   | it gets the name of the attachment type.                                                               |
| 01:03:25   | So if it's a PDF, it gets called PDF.PDF, which is the most unhelpful thing ever.                      |
| 01:03:32   | But if you open the quick look and then share it, but that's an extra couple of taps and               |
| 01:03:35   | I thought, you know, I don't really want to be opening things and tapping the share sheet              |
| 01:03:39   | and then finding DEVONthink and saving stuff.                                                          |
| 01:03:41   | No, no, no, no, no.                                                                                    |
| 01:03:42   | I want this to be automated.                                                                           |
| 01:03:43   | And then I remember that DEVONthink, of course, has AppleScript support and it ships with              |
| 01:03:48   | AppleScript to get things out of mail, both messages as well as attachments, or you can                |
| 01:03:54   | just do messages or just attachments.                                                                  |
| 01:03:56   | And so I set up a whole series of smart rules in mail and I am really, really happy because            |
| 01:04:01   | this automatically grabs anything coming in from the mortgage guy or anything coming                   |
| 01:04:06   | in from the person selling the place and stuff like that.                                              |
| 01:04:10   | And it grabs that and depending on the person, it grabs either just the attachments or just            |
| 01:04:15   | the email or both, and it puts it in DEVONthink.                                                       |
| 01:04:19   | And then I went a little bit crazy and used DEVONthink smart rules to automatically file               |
| 01:04:23   | it, because that just makes my life easier.                                                            |
| 01:04:26   | And then I'm there on my phone and I noticed, oh, hey, you know, I got an email yesterday              |
| 01:04:30   | from the mortgage people again.                                                                        |
| 01:04:32   | Oh, yeah, that's in DEVONthink already, great.                                                         |
| 01:04:34   | I can just fill that out and send it back and I've got a record of everything.                         |
| 01:04:37   | Yeah, the automatic downloading of attachments is a problem that there's a lot of ways to              |
| 01:04:42   | solve that.                                                                                            |
| 01:04:43   | And another way to solve that would be with a SaneBox account.                                         |
| 01:04:46   | If you're a SaneBox subscriber, you can automatically download attachments to Dropbox, for instance,   |
| 01:04:52   | so you can have them that way.                                                                         |
| 01:04:54   | But just attachments in general and email are a pain in the neck.                                      |
| 01:04:58   | One of the things I was thinking about while you're talking about is solving the problem               |
| 01:05:01   | on iOS a lot of times in the law job.                                                                  |
| 01:05:05   | I get multiple attachments from different emails that I need to send off to a single                   |
| 01:05:08   | person.                                                                                                |
| 01:05:10   | And the way I solve that, there's really a couple ways.                                                |
| 01:05:13   | The first is [[Yoink]], [[Yoink]] is a little lab, it's like a shelf app.                                      |
| 01:05:17   | They have an iPhone version too.                                                                       |
| 01:05:19   | It works particularly well though on iPad, so you can put [[Yoink]] on the one third of the                |
| 01:05:25   | screen and your mail app on two thirds of the screen and you can easily drag attachments               |
| 01:05:29   | from one to the other and then you don't hit that bug because it just saves the file to                |
| 01:05:33   | [[Yoink]].                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:34   | And then you can open a new email and just drag whatever you want over.                                |
| 01:05:38   | I also do the same thing with Basecamp because a lot of that stuff is legal related.                   |
| 01:05:44   | Basecamp, the Basecamp iOS app does a good job of catching attachments.                                |
| 01:05:48   | It recognises drag and drop easily, so there's a bunch of ways to do that.                             |
| 01:05:52   | I'm finding this to be a pretty good setup for me, especially because I've got a Mac                   |
| 01:05:57   | Mini running all the time and so I've set it up and I've put the mail rules back on                    |
| 01:06:01   | that machine.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:03   | And so it's just sitting there running and it doesn't matter if I get an email at two                  |
| 01:06:06   | o'clock in the morning or whatever, there's no interference, it just gets on with it and               |
| 01:06:10   | does it for me.                                                                                        |
| 01:06:11   | And that's really nice to wake up to everything being forwarded.                                       |
| 01:06:14   | And at one point I had to send like 25 different documents back.                                       |
| 01:06:18   | So first of all, you have to collect the 25 documents and then you have to find all of                 |
| 01:06:21   | them after you've collected them because it can take a couple of weeks to collect everything           |
| 01:06:24   | of course because nothing ever works that fast.                                                        |
| 01:06:27   | And then you have to send them back.                                                                   |
| 01:06:29   | And so I was using the tags in Dev and Think to tag everything that I've got this document             |
| 01:06:35   | now, right?                                                                                            |
| 01:06:36   | Tag it with me to send to this person, but I had to send all the documents together.                   |
| 01:06:40   | You couldn't send them.                                                                                |
| 01:06:41   | Oh, I finally got this document.                                                                       |
| 01:06:42   | Oh, I finally got that document.                                                                       |
| 01:06:44   | Oh, I finally got the other document.                                                                  |
| 01:06:45   | No, it had to be all in one email, but I got there and they now have a whole load of paperwork         |
| 01:06:50   | to plaster.                                                                                            |
| 01:06:51   | So that'll be good fun.                                                                                |
| 01:06:52   | Yeah, if you've got a Macintosh running 24-7, the [[Apple Mail]] rules are an amazing tool set             |
| 01:06:59   | for automators.                                                                                        |
| 01:07:00   | You know, I talk about how I'm jealous of Google's cloud-based automation tools, but                   |
| 01:07:07   | I think at least the last time I looked at Google's email sorting set, it didn't come                  |
| 01:07:11   | close to what you can do with Apple Mail natively on a Mac.                                            |
| 01:07:15   | But the Mac has to be running in the background in order to make that work.                            |
| 01:07:18   | I solved a similar problem, well, not similar, but an email-related problem, an attachment             |
| 01:07:24   | problem, kind of from the other direction.                                                             |
| 01:07:27   | We hit taxis and everybody wants my W9s.                                                               |
| 01:07:30   | I have two companies, one for the law, one for MacSparky.                                             |
| 01:07:34   | And it just became a pain in the neck when I'd get those emails and I was on my iPad.                  |
| 01:07:38   | On the Mac, I've got an automation that sends an email and has the W9 attachment.                      |
| 01:07:44   | But I didn't really have a good way to do that on iOS until we got a new app this month.               |
| 01:07:50   | I think we may need to do a whole show on it, but Data Jar is now out.                                  |
| 01:07:54   | And Data Jar is a free app, but it is a donation-friendly app.                                          |
| 01:08:00   | You can make donations in the app.                                                                     |
| 01:08:01   | I actually gave him, I went the full log, I gave him $5, so I bought him a burrito.                    |
| 01:08:06   | I think that was what he said.                                                                         |
| 01:08:08   | But it's just a data store for shortcuts, and not only can it hold tables of data or                   |
| 01:08:16   | variables, it can hold files.                                                                          |
| 01:08:18   | So there's this form in the US called the W9 form, it's the form you give to people                    |
| 01:08:23   | when they pay you and they have to report you on your taxes.                                           |
| 01:08:27   | And I've got now a shortcut created that writes the email, goes to Data Jar, pulls the attachment       |
| 01:08:34   | and then creates the email for me.                                                                     |
| 01:08:36   | It's just a simple shortcut.                                                                           |
| 01:08:38   | It's only three or four steps, but the magic was having the ability to have that attachment            |
| 01:08:44   | show up anytime I write it.                                                                            |
| 01:08:46   | And I guess I could have done it from inside shortcuts if I had done a, the name's escaping            |
| 01:08:54   | me now.                                                                                                |
| 01:08:55   | What is the thing where you convert a digital file to 1s and 0s?                                       |
| 01:08:59   | Do you mean base 64 encoding or a binary?                                                              |
| 01:09:01   | Yeah, base 64.                                                                                         |
| 01:09:02   | Yeah, base 64, 1s and 0s, but yes, I get what you mean.                                                |
| 01:09:06   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:07   | In my head, I'm a simpleton, but yeah, I could have base 64 encrypted it, but having                   |
| 01:09:12   | it in Data Jar is so much easier.                                                                       |
| 01:09:15   | The shortcut makes the shortcut a lot smaller, which makes it more reliable.                           |
| 01:09:20   | And if I update the W9, I just update it in Data Jar and it gets copied over because it                 |
| 01:09:25   | just, you know, you keep the same name for the file.                                                   |
| 01:09:29   | Data Jar solves a lot of problems.                                                                      |
| 01:09:30   | Yes, yes, it does.                                                                                     |
| 01:09:32   | I've been playing a lot with Data Jar and a slight spoiler for the next episode or maybe                |
| 01:09:36   | as a teaser, Data Jar will be featured on the next episode of Automators, but I'm not going             |
| 01:09:41   | to give anybody any more details just yet.                                                             |
| 01:09:43   | You're going to have to listen and wait patiently.                                                     |
| 01:09:45   | Yeah, it's a great app.                                                                                |
| 01:09:47   | If you're using shortcuts, it just lets you create a bucket of variables that are always               |
| 01:09:52   | available to you.                                                                                      |
| 01:09:54   | Yes, yes, it does.                                                                                     |
| 01:09:55   | And files and much more.                                                                               |
| 01:09:57   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:58   | If you've ever realised that the global variables in [[Toolbox Pro]] are a little bit limiting, then       |
| 01:10:03   | this is what [[Data Jar ]]is for.                                                                           |
| 01:10:05   | It's a whole database on your iPhone or multiple databases.                                            |
| 01:10:10   | And it's amazing.                                                                                      |
| 01:10:11   | It's a free app.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:12   | I couldn't believe he just made it a free app.                                                         |
| 01:10:16   | Well, that is [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]].                                                                                   |
| 01:10:18   | He's very good at making great apps affordable to us.                                                  |
| 01:10:21   | So I would recommend everybody who can afford to, throwing him a breakfast burrito or whatever         |
| 01:10:26   | other option fits your budget if you can afford to do that, of course.                                 |
| 01:10:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:31   | But it really does change the game.                                                                    |
| 01:10:33   | So I solved a problem with that this month.                                                            |
| 01:10:35   | Anyway, there you have it.                                                                             |
| 01:10:37   | Music and playlists and a few other things on the Automators podcast.                                  |
| 01:10:42   | We will be back in two weeks with another episode.                                                     |

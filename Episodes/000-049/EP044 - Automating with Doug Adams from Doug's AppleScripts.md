| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, where we make our technology dance for us.                         |
| 00:06      | I'm David Sparks, joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                                     |
| 00:09      | Hi, Rosemary.                                                                                        |
| 00:10      | Hey, David.                                                                                          |
| 00:11      | How are you today?                                                                                   |
| 00:12      | Having a rough morning there, Rose?                                                                  |
| 00:15      | Well, it's been a long day at work.                                                                  |
| 00:17      | There's deadlines coming at me, but hey, today we get to do some relaxing or automating relaxing     |
| 00:23      | with music.                                                                                          |
| 00:24      | I'm not quite sure if that works, but let's go to go.                                                |
| 00:26      | I am real excited about our guest today.                                                             |
| 00:28      | It's one of my favourite automators, and for years, I've been going to a website called               |
| 00:33      | Doug's Scripts, and when we were talking about people that we thought we should absolutely           |
| 00:37      | have on the show, Doug was one of the first people on the list.                                      |
| 00:40      | Welcome to the show, Doug Adams.                                                                     |
| 00:42      | Well, thank you very much for asking me to be on.                                                    |
| 00:44      | It's a pleasure to meet both of you.                                                                 |
| 00:45      | Yeah, I mean, first of all, you make Doug's Scripts, and second, your name is Doug Adams.            |
| 00:50      | I don't know how we could not have you on.                                                           |
| 00:53      | You get tired of that?                                                                               |
| 00:55      | 42.                                                                                                  |
| 00:56      | Yeah, there you go.                                                                                  |
| 00:57      | That's nice.                                                                                         |
| 00:59      | Not so much anymore.                                                                                 |
| 01:00      | When I used to go to bookstores, people behind the counter would say, inevitably, hey, we've         |
| 01:06      | got books by a guy with your name back there, and sometimes I would say, well, I had to              |
| 01:13      | change my name because it used to be Emily Dickinson, but you have to think of something             |
| 01:19      | because it's just ridiculous, but I understand how people who have famous names feel.                |
| 01:24      | My mother is very upset because she thought the name Douglas Adams sounded great.                    |
| 01:29      | Yeah, it does.                                                                                       |
| 01:31      | But I can't use it.                                                                                  |
| 01:32      | I have to go by Doug Adams.                                                                          |
| 01:35      | So that's the way it works.                                                                          |
| 01:36      | When I was a kid, I discovered those books, and I felt like I had unlocked a secret code             |
| 01:40      | or something.                                                                                        |
| 01:41      | I loved them so much, but I also love Doug's Scripts.                                                |
| 01:46      | And for listeners who haven't heard of it, Doug's Scripts is this amazing website that               |
| 01:51      | is a collection of [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]], largely media focused, but I know you cover some other             |
| 01:56      | things too.                                                                                          |
| 01:57      | But I was looking at the website this morning, it said 575 Scripts for managing Your Media           |
| 02:04      | as of today.                                                                                         |
| 02:05      | By the time the show publishes, that number may change.                                              |
| 02:10      | But we always get people asking us, OK, I'm starting to figure out [[AppleScript]], but what            |
| 02:14      | am I supposed to do with it?                                                                         |
| 02:16      | And I always tell people, go to Doug's Scripts and just see everything that guy did with             |
| 02:19      | [[AppleScript]], and you'll get an idea of what you can do with it.                                     |
| 02:24      | It's funny because that's what Sal used to tell people, he used to tell young engineers,             |
| 02:31      | go look at Doug's Scripts, look what, this guy has 400 Scripts for iTunes alone.                     |
| 02:37      | If you want your app to become indispensable and to become an engine for extensible work             |
| 02:46      | that the original developers never thought of.                                                       |
| 02:49      | Put [[AppleScript]] in your app so it can be used.                                                      |
| 02:54      | And the apps I use now, they're the ones that use [[AppleScript]].                                      |
| 02:59      | I don't use apps that don't have [[AppleScript]].                                                       |
| 03:02      | Brent Simmons told me recently, he's coming out with NetNewsWire again, he's rejuvenated            |
| 03:07      | it and hopefully will bring back RSS, which is one of my favourite things of all time.                |
| 03:11      | And he said, one of the first things they thought of was, it's got to have [[AppleScript]]              |
| 03:16      | because that makes it extensible.                                                                    |
| 03:18      | It makes it more purposeful.                                                                         |
| 03:20      | And that's what's great about some of the old school apps that still use [[AppleScript]].               |
| 03:25      | You know what?                                                                                       |
| 03:26      | You can tell me because I don't know or I've forgotten.                                              |
| 03:29      | Can you have [[AppleScript]] apps on the Mac App Store?                                                 |
| 03:33      | I believe you can because BBEd, it's on the Mac App Store and it's got massive [[AppleScript]]          |
| 03:38      | extensibility.                                                                                       |
| 03:39      | That said, I did buy mine directly from Bare Bones, so I haven't checked it, but I know              |
| 03:45      | that there was originally with the Mac App Store, there were some definite sandboxing                |
| 03:48      | issues where you can do this and that and the other, but [[Apple]] seemed to have lightened              |
| 03:52      | that up in recent years.                                                                             |
| 03:53      | And I'm very glad because something David doesn't know about me, Doug Script is one                  |
| 03:57      | of the reasons why I got into the Mac in the first place.                                            |
| 03:59      | Because there were a bunch of things I wanted to do with iTunes that I couldn't do on my,            |
| 04:05      | I have no idea.                                                                                      |
| 04:06      | I think it was a Toshiba or maybe it was a HP Windows machine.                                       |
| 04:09      | I don't even remember it anymore.                                                                    |
| 04:10      | And I just couldn't do it.                                                                           |
| 04:11      | And I kept reading about the single [[AppleScript]].                                                    |
| 04:13      | Well, you can do that in [[AppleScript]].                                                               |
| 04:14      | And I was like, okay, so how do I get [[AppleScript]] on my, on my machine?                             |
| 04:17      | And the answer was buy a Mac.                                                                        |
| 04:19      | And here I am today.                                                                                 |
| 04:20      | Well, there we go.                                                                                   |
| 04:22      | The source material.                                                                                 |
| 04:23      | I, and to answer Doug's question, like I use the, some of the OmniFocus and some of the              |
| 04:29      | Omni Group apps from the App Store and they fully support [[AppleScript]], you know, Omni.               |
| 04:33      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 04:34      | Brent Simmons is at Omni, of course.                                                                 |
| 04:35      | So that's another company that does a lot of [[AppleScript]] support.                                   |
| 04:41      | But yeah.                                                                                            |
| 04:42      | And it's not just old apps.                                                                          |
| 04:43      | There's, I mean, there's a lot of current Mac apps that are doing a good job of supporting           |
| 04:47      | [[AppleScript]].                                                                                        |
| 04:48      | That's terrific.                                                                                     |
| 04:49      | I'm glad to hear that because it's, it's, you know, there used to be a time when everybody           |
| 04:53      | knew a little [[AppleScript]].                                                                          |
| 04:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 04:55      | Because, you know, I mean, I don't want to wax nostalgic, but, you know, back in the                 |
| 04:59      | day when, before multitasking and the only app that would work was the one in front,                 |
| 05:03      | you needed [[AppleScript]] to, you know, shift data around between applications and things              |
| 05:08      | like that.                                                                                           |
| 05:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 05:10      | You know, so everybody knew a little bit, but nowadays it's not necessary.                           |
| 05:13      | Nowadays you can find a specific app that does a specific thing.                                     |
| 05:16      | You don't need to, you probably find any, any derivation or any, any iteration of any                |
| 05:22      | bizarre sort of job you need done.                                                                   |
| 05:24      | You can find it.                                                                                     |
| 05:25      | I mean, at my site you can.                                                                          |
| 05:27      | Any strange little thing you can find.                                                               |
| 05:30      | I am, a few years ago, I had the pleasure of speaking at Sal's conference on automation              |
| 05:35      | and he had a bunch of guys there from [[Apple]] or some of them.                                         |
| 05:40      | They were from [[Apple]], some of them were formerly [[Apple]], talking about kind of the, you know,         |
| 05:45      | the birth of [[AppleScript]] and Apple Events and as users, you know, we kind of take it                |
| 05:51      | for granted, but the fact that they were able to create a system and [[AppleScript]] is kind            |
| 05:57      | of what, what drives the system, but the underlying system is Apple Events.                          |
| 06:01      | It's this right idea that your Mac can, can track every event it does, each Apple event              |
| 06:09      | and as a user, you can step in and stop them, change them, modify them and putting that              |
| 06:16      | underlying engine in the Mac operating system was not a guarantee, you know, it was a bit            |
| 06:22      | of a battle, I think, inside the company to get approval for that because it was a lot               |
| 06:25      | of extra work.                                                                                       |
| 06:27      | Thank goodness it was before all the security problems because I think in modern day, I              |
| 06:33      | don't think that any company would ever approve you putting something like Apple Events in           |
| 06:37      | and in fact, [[Apple]] did not approve something like that in the iOS operating system.                  |
| 06:43      | So they created this thing and then they said, okay, we, you know, it's like the dog that            |
| 06:47      | catches the car, what are we going to do with it?                                                    |
| 06:49      | And then they came up with a whole idea of [[AppleScript]] and it really is something that              |
| 06:54      | is not documented very well, but one of those little things that only could have happened            |
| 06:59      | at [[Apple]] at a certain time.                                                                          |
| 07:01      | You know, it's funny you say it's not documented and then that's, you know, that's a double          |
| 07:05      | its sword because real developers hate [[AppleScript]] because you can't nail it down.                  |
| 07:12      | It's so squishy.                                                                                     |
| 07:13      | But I love it because it's squishy.                                                                  |
| 07:15      | In fact, I'll tell you a little story.                                                               |
| 07:18      | I recently started playing old PlayStation games to kill the time and I have like old                |
| 07:24      | cartoon platform games, so Ratchet and Clank is a game I like to play, right?                        |
| 07:30      | So you collect weapons and you collect abilities as you go along and as you're getting ready         |
| 07:33      | to go to the next level, you've inevitably hit a boss and you've got to try to defeat                |
| 07:39      | the boss and you've got to try to defeat the boss and you've got to manage your weapons              |
| 07:42      | properly because the weapons do certain things.                                                      |
| 07:46      | All right.                                                                                           |
| 07:47      | If you're about to tell me that you've auto, that you've [[AppleScript]] Ratchet and Clank,             |
| 07:51      | I'm going to get excited.                                                                            |
| 07:53      | That's a good idea though.                                                                           |
| 07:55      | So what you've got to do is you've got to use your weapons properly to attack the boss               |
| 08:00      | and his minions and all that.                                                                        |
| 08:01      | And if you don't do it in the right order, you're not going to get to the next level.                |
| 08:05      | You've got to really manage it right.                                                                |
| 08:07      | But last night, I finally figured out how to do it with, I managed my weapons correctly,             |
| 08:11      | I defeated the boss, the crowd shears and I got these little endorphins going off in                 |
| 08:16      | my head.                                                                                             |
| 08:17      | Going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.                                                            |
| 08:18      | That's what working with [[AppleScript]] is like.                                                       |
| 08:22      | You can approach it three and four or five different ways and at some point you're going             |
| 08:26      | to go, oh, that's the way to do it.                                                                  |
| 08:28      | And it's almost like a puzzle sometimes, but that's the nature of it.                                |
| 08:32      | It has to be that way because Apple events come from different places and are generated              |
| 08:38      | by different apps.                                                                                   |
| 08:39      | And you can't have a solid pearl-like language to accommodate specific things because everything     |
| 08:48      | is different.                                                                                        |
| 08:49      | The way Mars edit handles data is different from the way [[BBEdit]] handles data.                       |
| 08:54      | So [[AppleScript]] is a nice interpreter of all that.                                                   |
| 08:57      | But sometimes you have to use your weapons this way first and then use your weapons this             |
| 09:03      | way in order to beat the boss.                                                                       |
| 09:06      | And that's what I find, that's a thrill for me.                                                      |
| 09:08      | It is.                                                                                               |
| 09:09      | And a point you made there that really people need to understand is [[AppleScript]] is also             |
| 09:14      | a function of the applications that access it.                                                       |
| 09:17      | And one guy sitting at a desk in Seattle may have a different idea of how to interact with           |
| 09:22      | [[AppleScript]] as opposed to a guy sitting at a desk in Missouri working on a different                |
| 09:26      | app.                                                                                                 |
| 09:27      | So just because what you do in the Omni Group app is going to work one way, doesn't mean             |
| 09:32      | when you open [[BBEdit]] that Rich is going to have decided to do it the same way.                      |
| 09:37      | And you do kind of have to learn the quirkiness of it as you go through.                             |
| 09:41      | Like I said, but it's fun though, right?                                                             |
| 09:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 09:43      | And the good news is there's so much [[AppleScript]] out there, like even a lot of Doug                 |
| 09:46      | Scripts I've taken apart to see how he solved a problem and then you learn from them.                |
| 09:52      | I mean, it's a very, and if you're not a programmer, there's not a bunch of brackets                 |
| 09:57      | and API calls, it's just, it's plain text to a certain extent.                                       |
| 10:03      | And someone who's not a programmer can kind of unwind a script and rebuild it to their               |
| 10:09      | need.                                                                                                |
| 10:10      | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| 10:11      | And the scripting dictionaries are there as well.                                                    |
| 10:12      | So to help somewhat to some extent combat that squishiness, you can go through and you               |
| 10:17      | can figure out, okay, so what is it that I'm talking to and what is it database in one               |
| 10:21      | application might be a document in another application or it might just be nothing and               |
| 10:27      | you have to figure out something completely different.                                               |
| 10:29      | But it's all, it's there somewhere somehow.                                                          |
| 10:33      | And usually once you find an example or two of how to talk to that app with [[AppleScript]],            |
| 10:38      | well, that's the point where you can jump at the top of the slope and then you start                 |
| 10:43      | sliding down, collecting bits here and there as you go.                                              |
| 10:46      | Hey, I want to talk about getting started and [[AppleScript]] tools, but let's take a quick             |
| 10:51      | break.                                                                                               |

| 12:32      | Doug, how did you get started with [[AppleScript]]?                                                     |
| 12:36      | I mean, you didn't just, you were just born in [[AppleScript]] Wizard.                                  |
| 12:38      | Oh, no, not at all.                                                                                  |
| 12:40      | I'm not a computer person at all.                                                                    |
| 12:42      | I came at programming computers from music.                                                          |
| 12:48      | I had, back in the 80s, a bunch of digital synthesisers, and I was doing a lot of music              |
| 12:53      | stuff, and I needed a way to stick the digital sounds into a digital database and the stuff          |
| 13:01      | they had a Commodore at the time.                                                                    |
| 13:03      | And I had a Commodore- C64?                                                                          |
| 13:05      | Yeah, C64.                                                                                           |
| 13:07      | And the reason I had a C64 is because I didn't really need anything more powerful than that          |
| 13:12      | to do what I needed.                                                                                 |
| 13:13      | It was, I wasn't, like I said, I wasn't a computer guy.                                              |
| 13:15      | I just needed to manage the music, and there was some decent cheap software for music on             |
| 13:19      | the Commodore.                                                                                       |
| 13:20      | But anyway, I didn't like the software that they had for my synthesisers.                            |
| 13:24      | So I said, well, I'll just figure out how to write a database, I guess.                              |
| 13:28      | And I learned basic, and I learned machine language and stuff like that and, you know,               |
| 13:33      | built stuff.                                                                                         |
| 13:34      | And when I was on cue, this is at the era of cue link, of quantum link.                              |
| 13:37      | And there was a whole music area.                                                                    |
| 13:41      | And so my software was up on there for people to use.                                                |
| 13:45      | So that was kind of thrilling.                                                                       |
| 13:47      | But you had to pay quantum link to be on quantum link.                                               |
| 13:50      | So it was kind of, it didn't really benefit me much in any way.                                      |
| 13:56      | It's like when you get a $300 CompuServe bill, I remember those days.                                |
| 14:00      | Yo, $300, that's good for you.                                                                       |
| 14:03      | And anyway, so I didn't think much of computers really, but in fact, I thought of this the           |
| 14:10      | other day.                                                                                           |
| 14:11      | My experience of [[Apple]] was working with an audio, with a music guy in a studio one time.             |
| 14:17      | And he had a sequencer, a music sequencer on his Apple II, I think it was.                           |
| 14:22      | And every so often, he had to whack the side of it with his open palm, because something              |
| 14:27      | inside wasn't connected correctly.                                                                   |
| 14:29      | And that was my impression of [[Apple]].                                                                 |
| 14:30      | It was like, well, if he got to hit him on the side, it can't be any good.                           |
| 14:33      | So I might as well just hold on to the Commodore.                                                    |
| 14:35      | Yeah, it was probably the Apple II expansions.                                                       |
| 14:39      | Those were classic for those expansion, it was like the old video game cartridges.                   |
| 14:44      | And if you didn't see it just right, it didn't work.                                                 |
| 14:47      | Well, that's what must have been happening.                                                          |
| 14:50      | So anyway, so I didn't think much of [[Apple]] until my wife needed something to print out               |
| 14:56      | to papers for school.                                                                                |
| 14:58      | So I said, all right, we'll buy an [[Apple]] and we'll be fine.                                          |
| 15:00      | I bought a Performa or something.                                                                    |
| 15:02      | And that had, that came with 7.1 and that had [[AppleScript]] on it.                                    |
| 15:06      | So I was looking for something to do on the [[Apple]] because I was still using the Commodore            |
| 15:10      | for music.                                                                                           |
| 15:11      | And I couldn't really afford any [[Apple Music]] software because that was, that's when you              |
| 15:14      | got into expensive stuff.                                                                            |
| 15:16      | So I found [[AppleScript]] and I said, oh, this will be fun.                                            |
| 15:19      | I can look, I can automate my mail and my Usenet messages and I can, eventually I found              |
| 15:26      | a nice program called Tech Set It Plus and I started writing AppleScripts for that.                 |
| 15:31      | And the developer of Tech Set It Plus emailed me and said, say, listen, you seem like a              |
| 15:37      | nice guy.                                                                                            |
| 15:39      | You want to like, house all the AppleScripts for Tech Set It Plus on your website and you           |
| 15:44      | know, people who want them can come and get them from your website.                                  |
| 15:47      | And I thought, oh, I'm looking for an excuse to have a website.                                      |
| 15:50      | That sounds like a good idea.                                                                        |
| 15:52      | So I did that for a while.                                                                           |
| 15:53      | I have a Tech Set It, I think that site's still up somewhere.                                        |
| 15:57      | And so I dabbled in having these AppleScripts for Tech Set It Plus up.                              |
| 16:01      | Now, I don't know if you remember Tech Set It Plus, but it was a, it was a pretty good               |
| 16:05      | competitor with DB Edit back in the day.                                                             |
| 16:07      | In fact, I went back and forth between the two of them, but DB Edit one out eventually.              |
| 16:13      | And Tech Set It Plus kind of stopped developing it after a while.                                    |
| 16:17      | But anyway, I was always looking for something to AppleScript and Sound Jam was there.              |
| 16:23      | I was using that.                                                                                    |
| 16:25      | And so I wrote some scripts for Sound Jam and put those up on the website and then [[Apple]]             |
| 16:29      | bought Sound Jam.                                                                                    |
| 16:30      | And then so I had an iTunes website.                                                                 |
| 16:32      | So then the rest is history.                                                                         |
| 16:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 16:35      | And, and quite a history because for so many years you've been kind of the leader, especially        |
| 16:40      | with iTunes scripting.                                                                               |
| 16:43      | And I know a lot of listeners, I'm sure have gone to your website.                                   |
| 16:46      | I know, I think, I think I'm a customer, I think I've bought scripts from you.                       |
| 16:49      | You had some packages over the years that I've purchased.                                            |
| 16:53      | And, and then [[Apple]] came out with music, Apple Music, as opposed to iTunes and we're all             |
| 16:58      | worried is Doug going to be okay.                                                                    |
| 17:00      | Yeah, my first reaction was, wait, what's happening to Doug's scripts?                               |
| 17:05      | Well, you know, I'm trying to remember what I thought they were going to do because there            |
| 17:10      | were rumors that they were going to break it up for years.                                           |
| 17:14      | And then they did, I think they confirmed it almost about a year ago now.                            |
| 17:20      | And it seemed to me that they would keep the AppleScript.                                           |
| 17:26      | There were too many things that were dependent on it as far as automation went.                      |
| 17:32      | And so, you know, while the other things went to Marzipan, while, you know, podcasts and             |
| 17:38      | things like that are in books went that way.                                                         |
| 17:41      | They kept TV and music a little more robust and they kept the AppleScript in it.                    |
| 17:46      | And it's virtually the same thing.                                                                   |
| 17:50      | There's some, you know, bumps here and there.                                                        |
| 17:53      | For instance, I don't think TV has album artist, some things like that, you know, there's            |
| 17:58      | just little quirks here and there.                                                                   |
| 18:00      | But in general, they're more or less the same sort of scripts.                                       |
| 18:04      | I've taken the opportunity actually just to clean up all my scripts and, you know, reorganise        |
| 18:08      | them and make them a little cleaner as far as the code goes.                                         |
| 18:11      | Some of them are three, four, five years old.                                                        |
| 18:13      | Sometimes, you know, I, you say, oh, it's been a long time.                                          |
| 18:15      | I really, I've been on, I've been making these silly things for 20 years.                            |
| 18:20      | I just can't, I'm like, I'm having trouble like just grasping that length of time, how               |
| 18:25      | long, how long it's been going on.                                                                   |
| 18:27      | It seems to me it's only been like three or four years.                                              |
| 18:30      | Time goes fast, man.                                                                                 |
| 18:31      | Time goes fast.                                                                                      |
| 18:32      | I guess so.                                                                                          |
| 18:33      | But, you know, the nice thing with the AppleScript is the ones you wrote 20 years ago               |
| 18:35      | probably still work.                                                                                 |
| 18:36      | Oh, yeah, they do.                                                                                   |
| 18:37      | Oh, absolutely.                                                                                      |
| 18:38      | Some of the simpler ones, sure.                                                                      |
| 18:40      | Yeah, they, because it really, I mean, once it, you know, it's such a weird thing.                   |
| 18:45      | AppleScript.                                                                                        |
| 18:46      | And like we were saying earlier, it is hard for developers to pick up.                               |
| 18:49      | It's hard for normal people to pick up too, because you still have to have some concept              |
| 18:53      | of development or software logic.                                                                    |
| 18:56      | And it is funny because you write things different ways.                                             |
| 19:00      | But the, but that timelessness of AppleScript is really something.                                  |
| 19:05      | And so long as the applications continue to support it in the same method that they started,         |
| 19:10      | most of the scripts are going to continue to work.                                                   |
| 19:12      | Well, it's terrific too.                                                                             |
| 19:13      | One of the other things that I really like now is that you can tap into, you know, the               |
| 19:16      | cocoa frameworks.                                                                                    |
| 19:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:18      | And then you can create, I can create these great interfaces using, you know, I have to              |
| 19:23      | hand code it of course, but still I can pull in foundation, an app kit, an AV foundation,            |
| 19:28      | a game kit, all kinds of stuff you can do.                                                           |
| 19:30      | And you can create legitimate cocoa apps.                                                            |
| 19:34      | They're not, they're not very robust.                                                                |
| 19:36      | I mean, you're really, you're still only dealing with that one thread that AppleScript              |
| 19:41      | can deal with, so you can't really do lots of multi-threaded things.                                 |
| 19:43      | But you can do quite a bit using, you know, a lot of the frameworks that are available               |
| 19:49      | otherwise to cocoa.                                                                                  |
| 19:51      | That's something we have salsa going to think for, because everybody always saw Sal as the           |
| 19:57      | guy who was the, you know, the advocate for automation for [[Apple]] customers.                          |
| 20:02      | I think his job more was being the advocate for automation to [[Apple]] developers.                      |
| 20:07      | I think he was running around.                                                                       |
| 20:10      | One of the stories I heard recently, I hope I don't get, he didn't tell me the story.                |
| 20:15      | It was told me about him that when one of the teams was working on a particular piece                |
| 20:20      | of [[Apple]] software and the, the head developer of that software did not want to spend a lot           |
| 20:25      | of time on AppleScript.                                                                             |
| 20:26      | They were working on other things.                                                                   |
| 20:27      | It wasn't a priority that the team would put Sal into the room through the back door.                |
| 20:33      | They had like a special door that Sal would come in.                                                 |
| 20:36      | And of course, because Sal wanted AppleScript in this app, he would come in through the             |
| 20:40      | back door and do his magic and then leave and then the head developer would never know.              |
| 20:47      | That's a great story.                                                                                |
| 20:48      | And that is exactly what he would, no, it's true.                                                    |
| 20:50      | I mean, the person told me it was in the room when this was going on, but I like this guy            |
| 20:55      | really fought for automation inside that company.                                                    |
| 20:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 21:00      | Yeah, it's true.                                                                                     |
| 21:01      | I'm glad he did because it's really, it is a terrific, terrific thing.                               |
| 21:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 21:05      | And it means that we have all of these fabulous things in all of the apps that support [[AppleScript]],         |
| 21:09      | you know, because just because an app supports AppleScript doesn't mean, well,              |
| 21:13      | you know, you can do everything, but there's, there's so much there that's built in by default       |
| 21:17      | from the operating system, which gives developers a head start.                                      |
| 21:21      | And that makes it much easier for all of us who want to automate things.                             |
| 21:25      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 21:26      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 21:27      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 21:28      | One of the things I wanted to talk about was AppleScripting tools.                                  |
| 21:30      | Now, [[Apple]] ships, AppleScript editor, which is a good tool for making AppleScripts.                |
| 21:37      | But there's also a very popular one out there called [[Script Debugger]], and, and you used              |
| 21:41      | a different, I said it was text edit plus, I believe it was called years ago.                        |
| 21:46      | Years ago.                                                                                           |
| 21:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 21:48      | And so what tools do you use and kind of, if someone's out there listening, what are                 |
| 21:50      | your thoughts on whether they need to get a more powerful tool?                                      |
| 21:55      | I think script editor is fine, but I've gone back and forth with [[Script Debugger]].                    |
| 22:00      | For years I used [[Script Debugger]].                                                                    |
| 22:03      | And then I stopped because I wanted to, I wanted to be able to explain to regular users              |
| 22:08      | how to do stuff.                                                                                     |
| 22:10      | And [[Script Debugger]] is great if you know your stuff.                                                 |
| 22:14      | And I, and that's not to, to suggest that you shouldn't get it if you don't know your                |
| 22:17      | stuff because you'll, you'll learn it pretty fast.                                                   |
| 22:20      | But I think you'll have a steeper climb if you don't start with something simpler.                   |
| 22:24      | But if you know your stuff, absolutely [[Script Debugger]] is the way to go.                             |
| 22:27      | But I stick with script, AppleScript editor, script editor, whatever they're calling it.            |
| 22:31      | It's easy to get tongue-tied on this stuff.                                                          |
| 22:34      | I like script editor because I can write scripts for it.                                             |
| 22:36      | I've written, over the years I've written scripts that, you know, make things for me                 |
| 22:41      | in it.                                                                                               |
| 22:42      | It's been central, like I said, I like to be able to explain to people how to do things              |
| 22:46      | with it.                                                                                             |
| 22:47      | So I like to have it available.                                                                      |
| 22:48      | I like to know what script editor is going to show them so that I can see it.                        |
| 22:52      | So while, yes, it's a bit of a pain for me to work with script editor sometimes and some             |
| 22:56      | of its quirks and some of its, why are you closing every window when I just want to close            |
| 23:02      | that window, things that happen with it?                                                             |
| 23:05      | Generally I find it okay.                                                                            |
| 23:08      | But [[Script Debugger]] is, is, is wonderful.                                                            |
| 23:10      | Actually, late night software themselves are terrific.                                               |
| 23:13      | They have a great AppleScript forum with some terrific people who participate.                      |
| 23:19      | And if you know Shane, I'm sure you know Shane Stanley.                                              |
| 23:23      | He's just the most giving person I've ever met in technology.                                        |
| 23:27      | The guy is just, will answer any question.                                                           |
| 23:29      | Maybe I shouldn't have said that because now he's going to get in and do it with tons                |
| 23:32      | of them.                                                                                             |
| 23:33      | But he, they run a great forum over there that he participates in.                                   |
| 23:35      | I really like it.                                                                                    |
| 23:36      | Well, and it was interesting because he was at this conference, this automation conference           |
| 23:39      | Sal gave and he talked as well and they had a list that they wanted, you know, the perfect           |
| 23:45      | AppleScript writing app they wanted to build when they were at [[Apple]].                               |
| 23:49      | And of course, you know, there's priorities, you know, and AppleScript isn't the number             |
| 23:53      | one priority at [[Apple]] and they're like, well, we're going to give you enough time and budget         |
| 23:56      | to get this far down that road, but you know, you're not going to get everything on your             |
| 24:00      | list.                                                                                                |
| 24:01      | So, so he let when he left [[Apple]], eventually he's like, okay, well, I'm going to finish              |
| 24:04      | that list.                                                                                           |
| 24:05      | And [[Script Debugger]] is basically the AppleScript editor, plus all the extra tools, the              |
| 24:09      | guys that made AppleScript wanted.                                                                  |
| 24:12      | And I think you're right.                                                                            |
| 24:13      | It can be overwhelming if you have never done AppleScript before.                                   |
| 24:16      | But the thing I like about it and the reason I'm a, I buy every update is their library              |
| 24:21      | support is just so much better.                                                                      |
| 24:23      | And you know, the thing about AppleScript is learning those libraries for those apps                |
| 24:27      | you use.                                                                                             |
| 24:28      | And, and I feel like [[Script Debugger]], man, it just kills that so well.                               |
| 24:33      | For me, it's, it's a challenge to write AppleScripts for everything.                                |
| 24:38      | I don't use Automator, for example, when the Automator first came out, I thought it was              |
| 24:42      | pretty cool.                                                                                         |
| 24:43      | I remember Sal told me, I said, well, so what do you, so what do you do?                             |
| 24:47      | You make these actions and you make them available and you go, and you sell them.                    |
| 24:52      | But that never happened.                                                                             |
| 24:54      | But anyway, I did make a few and I, I know people love Automator and it has some, actually           |
| 25:01      | some cool features like the ability to stick it in the services menu and make little, you            |
| 25:05      | know, self running apps and things.                                                                  |
| 25:06      | I really like that stuff.                                                                            |
| 25:08      | But I, I've always felt that, well, I can automate it with AppleScript.                             |
| 25:12      | I'll just use AppleScript.                                                                          |
| 25:14      | And so that's, that's kind of what the challenge is for me.                                          |
| 25:16      | I've got plenty of time.                                                                             |
| 25:17      | I mean, this is kind of what I do.                                                                   |
| 25:20      | I mean, I know people probably imagine, oh, he gets up at seven o'clock and writes [[AppleScript]]             |
| 25:23      | all day.                                                                                      |
| 25:24      | That's not what I do.                                                                                |
| 25:25      | But I mean, I have the time to spend, yeah, it's my thing, exactly.                                  |
| 25:30      | It's my hobby and my thing.                                                                          |
| 25:32      | So I don't mind using script editor.                                                                 |
| 25:34      | I wish they would tidy it up a little bit, but I don't want, I don't want to jinx it.                |
| 25:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 25:39      | I don't want to ask for too much.                                                                    |
| 25:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 25:41      | Well, I think at this point it would be work to take AppleScript out of the operating               |
| 25:44      | system.                                                                                              |
| 25:45      | So we're probably safe.                                                                              |
| 25:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 25:47      | I think that's why people shouldn't worry about whether AppleScript is going to disappear.          |
| 25:50      | Because as you said earlier, Apple events are there.                                                 |
| 25:53      | So if you're going to have Apple events, you might as well have an AppleScript editor.              |
| 25:57      | And I look at like the shortcuts development, you know, the, where it started and where              |
| 26:02      | it's gone.                                                                                           |
| 26:03      | And a part of me, my heart breaks for automator.                                                     |
| 26:05      | I feel like that is the, what should have happened with automator and, you know, with                |
| 26:12      | the shortcuts, you can have variables, you can have user interaction, there's so many                |
| 26:16      | things you can do that just don't work with automator.                                               |
| 26:20      | And that, that's where we could have gone, but I totally see why you would not be the                |
| 26:25      | automator demographic because you write scripts, you know, so you, you're so familiar with           |
| 26:30      | AppleScript that why would you tie one hand behind your back?                                       |
| 26:33      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 26:34      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 26:35      | I've already written in my head by the time I've opened the script editor document                   |
| 26:36      | to, to write it.                                                                                     |
| 26:37      | So it's, it's that way.                                                                              |
| 26:40      | I haven't used shortcuts because, and I feel bad, but I'm not a mobile person.                       |
| 26:45      | I work out of my house.                                                                              |
| 26:47      | So I don't need a mobile computer.                                                                   |
| 26:49      | And then I don't need all of these time saving things to happen on, on my phone.                     |
| 26:55      | And I feel terrible because I'd love to be able to contribute, but I just don't have                 |
| 26:58      | any impetus to even to jump into that.                                                               |
| 27:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 27:02      | I just want to quickly jump back to something you said, you've automated script editor.              |
| 27:07      | What kind of things are you automating in script editor?                                             |
| 27:09      | Well, like, for instance, if I use, um, well, here's what I do.                                      |
| 27:13      | I have a lot of snippets that I use notes for the notes app.                                         |
| 27:17      | And I have a book of a booklet.                                                                      |
| 27:21      | That's, uh, that's another app that has books, um, notes has what, what do they call those?          |
| 27:27      | Those little things on the side there, the folders, whatever they are folders, I have                |
| 27:32      | folders of various snippets that I use.                                                              |
| 27:34      | So I can pull up AppleScripts that pull the script syntax from the notes page into                  |
| 27:41      | another app.                                                                                         |
| 27:42      | For instance, I have to create NS table views all the time.                                          |
| 27:46      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 27:47      | So, and I don't want to sit there and write, uh, tell current applications, NS table view            |
| 27:51      | to init for frame, blah, blah, blah, blah.                                                           |
| 27:52      | So I just pull all that in and all that stuff is already written in the notes app.                   |
| 27:55      | So that's what I do.                                                                                 |
| 27:57      | I have my, I've written my own libraries as well.                                                    |
| 27:59      | So that's the sort of thing that I write scripts to automate script editor for.                      |
| 28:04      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 28:05      | So you're, it's essentially templates or parts of templates that you're, you're using pretty         |
| 28:08      | much with that.                                                                                      |
| 28:09      | But that's, you know, that's the sort of thing that it's going to make somebody like your            |
| 28:13      | life easier because you've got a lot of these things, whereas at the moment I'm still very           |
| 28:17      | much in the area of I'm, I'm getting to learn AppleScripts.                                         |
| 28:19      | So in my case, it's probably a good thing that I'm going back and copying and pasting                |
| 28:23      | the chunks because then I'm there going, oh yeah, but actually I could automate this or              |
| 28:27      | improve this while I'm doing it.                                                                     |
| 28:28      | So yeah.                                                                                             |
| 28:29      | The, um, absolutely writing it by hand.                                                              |
| 28:31      | I mean, it's, it's a badge of honour to me to write stuff by hand.                                    |
| 28:38      | I don't like templates.                                                                              |
| 28:39      | My, my website, I do it by hand with the, with the exception of the WordPress blog                   |
| 28:44      | portion, everything else I've written in hand coded in PHP and in [[BBEdit]] and the database           |
| 28:51      | management stuff.                                                                                    |
| 28:52      | I've all, I do it by hand.                                                                           |
| 28:53      | The same thing with writing an AppleScript.                                                         |
| 28:55      | I like writing it by hand.                                                                           |
| 28:56      | Now I do a lot of automated stuff, but you still have to look at what's there and say,               |
| 29:01      | well, that table, that needs to have three columns and, uh, that matrix isn't two columns.           |
| 29:07      | It's one column with two rows and, you know, there's always something different.                     |
| 29:12      | There's always a new problem, uh, coming at me.                                                      |
| 29:15      | Um, sometimes I'll even take the same idea from one script and say, wait a minute.                   |
| 29:20      | I could do that like this.                                                                           |
| 29:22      | And then I can, and then the script becomes a, a different app.                                      |
| 29:27      | I'm not sure.                                                                                        |
| 29:28      | Now I'm not explaining that right.                                                                   |
| 29:29      | That sounds like I just walked out of a, out of a man called horse.                                  |
| 29:32      | Now they even, that sounds like I just came out of the man called horse.                             |
| 29:35      | Well, it was like I was saying earlier on, if you take a different perspective, it can               |
| 29:39      | take you in a different place with AppleScript and it's just, it's just part of the journey.        |
| 29:43      | I guess.                                                                                             |
| 29:44      | Well, the thing I love about your scripts is like you're using table views.                          |
| 29:47      | I mean, you are really pushing the AppleScript, I think to, you know, it's full potential.          |
| 29:53      | Like I, I wrote a script recently that just goes and, and extracts the icon file from an             |
| 29:59      | application, you know, and that to me is like my high level scripting.                               |
| 30:03      | I'm not writing it as table view scripts, you know, and, um, that's, that's why I love               |
| 30:09      | your website so much.                                                                                |
| 30:10      | It's very inspirational for people out there that want to get better at AppleScripting,             |
| 30:14      | just to get an idea for what you can do with the app.                                                |
| 30:17      | And, and, uh, it's just, you know, for, for, for standard users that don't want to write             |
| 30:23      | the next great app, but they want to take the three apps that they use every day and                 |
| 30:27      | make them work together better.                                                                      |
| 30:29      | This is the way you go.                                                                              |
| 30:30      | Apple events plus AppleScript.                                                                      |
| 30:32      | Yeah, that's it.                                                                                     |
| 30:33      | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| 30:34      | I mean, and then there's nothing to stop you from writing your own app in AppleScript.              |
| 30:38      | You know, if there's an app out there that there's not an app out there that you, that               |
| 30:43      | you require, you know, do what I did.                                                                |
| 30:46      | I needed to store digital information on a computer.                                                 |
| 30:49      | I went out and bought a Commodore and learned how to program the database, you know, sometimes       |
| 30:53      | you just have to like, you have to do it yourself.                                                   |
| 30:57      | Where would you recommend someone go to get started if they wanted to get better at [[AppleScript]]?            |
| 31:03      | Well, it's tough to say nowadays because, you know, back in the day, AppleScript was                |
| 31:07      | everywhere and you really could just type it AppleScript into a search engine into                  |
| 31:10      | Jumbo, no, probably, or something like that, or Alta Vista, and, you know, when you'd find           |
| 31:17      | people posting scripts everywhere, MacScripter still has a lot of great forum posts that,            |
| 31:25      | you know, if you have a question, you can certainly search that their forums.                        |
| 31:29      | Late night is pretty good, although they, their forums more or less are like an intermediate         |
| 31:35      | sort of level of questioning, and also it's for script debugger.                                     |
| 31:41      | So you might not see some stuff there, but one of the things you can also do is check                |
| 31:44      | out Stack Overflow.                                                                                  |
| 31:45      | There's still a lot of AppleScript stuff up there, and it doesn't hurt to learn a little            |
| 31:50      | objective C and [[Swift]] syntax just to, you know, just to know how those things work.                  |
| 31:57      | I mean, it's not, once I figured out AppleScript, I pretty much figured out everything              |
| 32:00      | else.                                                                                                |
| 32:01      | JavaScript, the Perl came really easy, and then everything else just fell into place                 |
| 32:06      | after that.                                                                                          |
| 32:07      | I would add to that a book recommendation, Sal Soghoians, AppleScript one, two, three.             |
| 32:11      | That's a good one.                                                                                   |
| 32:12      | Absolutely.                                                                                          |
| 32:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 32:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 32:15      | For me, the key with AppleScript has been keeping the problem that I have in mind and               |
| 32:18      | the solution, and, you know, like a couple of solutions.                                             |
| 32:23      | And so being aware that, hey, if I'm getting stuck going in this direction, stop running             |
| 32:27      | into this wall, try and approach it from a different way, because there's a gate somewhere           |
| 32:30      | with AppleScript, you just have to figure out where it is, and this goes back to what               |
| 32:33      | you were saying with the squishiness of AppleScript, you know, just because you can squish          |
| 32:36      | it this way and this application doesn't mean you can do it the same way in another                  |
| 32:39      | app.                                                                                                 |
| 32:40      | But if you get a little bit creative, you know, and you remember that, okay, this is                 |
| 32:45      | the problem you're trying to solve, how exactly you solve it, you know, that's the flexible          |
| 32:49      | part, you know, that that's where it can get a lot easier.                                           |
| 32:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 32:53      | That's a good point because you have to keep your mind on what you're trying to do, because          |
| 32:56      | there could, as you say, there can be any number of ways that different apps handle                  |
| 33:01      | the same kind of data, but you've got to remember that you may have to toss it around a little       |
| 33:05      | bit, you may have to get a little messy, but ultimately, you can usually arrive at what              |
| 33:10      | you need to do.                                                                                      |
| 33:12      | And of course, you can also remember that you don't have to automate everything.                     |
| 33:17      | So just because you want to do everything in an automated fashion, well, if you can get              |
| 33:22      | 95% of it done, well, that's still going to be more accurate that, you know, whenever                |
| 33:26      | you run that script, and then you can, you can do that last little bit manually until                |
| 33:30      | you figure that out.                                                                                 |
| 33:31      | And it gives you a motivation to keep learning.                                                      |
| 33:34      | That's a good point.                                                                                 |
| 33:35      | And I'll tell you why.                                                                               |
| 33:36      | A lot of people see, and I don't see a lot of people, many people will see that an [[AppleScript]]             |
| 33:42      | can do something that looks fairly amazing, but they don't realise that a lot                 |
| 33:46      | of the things you can do already, for instance, they're looking for a script that will sort          |
| 33:51      | their playlist.                                                                                      |
| 33:52      | Well, they already have smart playlists, and they already have, you know, this column sorting        |
| 33:58      | stuff.                                                                                               |
| 33:59      | You can use that to sort and then use an AppleScript rather than try to get an AppleScript.        |
| 34:04      | Try getting AppleScript to sort anything, okay, or you want to have a party, invite                 |
| 34:09      | some friends over and you all sit around, you try to figure out how to sort stuff in                 |
| 34:12      | AppleScript because it's really difficult.                                                          |
| 34:15      | It's a difficult thing to do.                                                                        |
| 34:16      | But if you sort it by yourself, you know, you don't have to use the magic wand all the               |
| 34:21      | time.                                                                                                |
| 34:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 34:23      | You can use a little bit of manual work to get yourself started with these things or                 |
| 34:26      | finish them off or maybe in the middle.                                                              |
| 34:29      | The middle is my least favourite part to have to manually do something because it really              |
| 34:32      | feels like, oh, man, if I could just get this little bit done, but if you've got something           |
| 34:37      | at the start or the end, then, you know, that's nowhere near as bad and it always feels like,        |
| 34:40      | okay, so I do this and then I do that and oh my gosh, magic happens.                                 |
| 34:44      | I hate that manual thing in the middle, man.                                                         |
| 34:46      | I hate it.                                                                                           |
| 34:47      | I hate doing that.                                                                                   |

| 35:00      | Wouldn't it be easier if all of these things worked together without you ever lifting a              |
| 35:04      | finger?                                                                                              |

| 35:50      | One of the ways that I use Zapier is when I get assigned tasks like shows and articles               |
| 35:54      | over at Screencast Online, it automatically creates OmniFocus tasks for me and then sends            |
| 35:59      | me a push cut notification to let me know that I've got work to do.                                  |
| 36:03      | One of the features I love most is the fact that it integrates with pretty much everything           |
| 36:07      | I've ever tried and for the things that I know that I need to integrate with that aren't             |
| 36:11      | yet on Zapier, I can use webhooks to build my own integrations too.                                  |
| 36:16      | It's really easy to use Zapier just because everything pretty much is already there and              |
| 36:20      | everything's documented too.                                                                         |

| 36:46      | So Doug, 575 scripts on Doug's scripts.                                                              |
| 36:51      | All right, well, that number, you know what that number is?                                          |
| 36:54      | That number is some all the track entries in the database.                                           |
| 37:00      | So of that 571, probably about 271 are useless, old, can't possibly work under any circumstances.    |
| 37:11      | But I leave them up so that people can grab them and look at them and see, well, this                |
| 37:15      | is at least how you would put something like that together for the record's sake.                    |
| 37:21      | For the record's sake.                                                                               |
| 37:22      | Well, I know I have some favourites of yours, but I'd like to hear from you.                          |
| 37:27      | Could you share a couple with us, maybe like a simple one and a more complex one, and explain        |
| 37:32      | a little bit of the AppleScript behind it of how you did it?                                        |
| 37:35      | We don't want to go through line by line, that doesn't work on a podcast, but just kind              |
| 37:38      | of the logic of it.                                                                                  |
| 37:41      | Well, let me look at, what did I just put up recently?                                               |
| 37:45      | Oh, I put up a script called make playlists by tag.                                                  |
| 37:50      | And what it does is it looks at your entire library.                                                 |
| 37:54      | And you say, I want to have a bunch of playlists that are created using the name of the artist.      |
| 38:01      | So you select that you want to see all the artists, all the artists in your music.                   |
| 38:08      | And it presents them in a table with a little checkmark.                                             |
| 38:10      | And then you checkmark the ones that look like you want to have playlists of them.                   |
| 38:16      | And then you say, okay, go now make playlists of all these artists.                                  |
| 38:21      | And it'll do that in a few seconds.                                                                  |
| 38:23      | I'm trying to think how I did that.                                                                  |
| 38:25      | Let's see.                                                                                           |
| 38:26      | First of all, it's a table with a menu, with a pop-up menu.                                          |
| 38:33      | And it's also got a search filter thing at the top.                                                  |
| 38:36      | So you don't have to look at 2,000 artists, which I have in the picture that I'm looking             |
| 38:40      | at.                                                                                                  |
| 38:41      | Now, let me just interrupt there, because that table does not look like the tables I've              |
| 38:45      | ever made in AppleScript.                                                                            |
| 38:47      | My tables are very basic, texty-looking AppleScript tables, whereas yours looks like an application. |
| 38:55      | How are you doing that?                                                                              |
| 38:56      | All right.                                                                                           |
| 38:57      | Well, this is made using the foundation and AppKit frameworks.                                       |
| 39:02      | So what I do is I use those.                                                                         |
| 39:04      | Some syntax you put at the top of your script.                                                       |
| 39:08      | And then you tell NSTableView to make a table.                                                       |
| 39:13      | And then you create various sized columns.                                                           |
| 39:18      | You add them to the table.                                                                           |
| 39:21      | In this particular case, I think I wrote the text to be the system font, and I made the              |
| 39:31      | cell spacing 3, 7, so that is there's three pixels on the top and seven on the side.                 |
| 39:38      | Is that how that works?                                                                              |
| 39:39      | So there's a little more spacing in there.                                                           |
| 39:42      | You see the checkboxes in there, they have to be balanced because there's no, please                 |
| 39:47      | align this checkbox in the middle.                                                                   |
| 39:50      | So the whole thing is dependent on how the checkbox looks in that row.                               |
| 39:56      | The checkbox is perfectly centred.                                                                  |
| 39:58      | So everything else has to work on that.                                                              |
| 40:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 40:02      | You say, I mean, I'm really getting into the inside baseball here.                                   |
| 40:05      | That's okay.                                                                                         |
| 40:06      | We're the animators.                                                                                 |
| 40:07      | We can take it.                                                                                      |
| 40:08      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 40:09      | All right.                                                                                           |
| 40:10      | Well, so anyway, there's also, in this picture, I presume you're going to put a link to this         |
| 40:13      | picture.                                                                                             |
| 40:14      | You know what we're looking at.                                                                      |
| 40:15      | Sure.                                                                                                |
| 40:16      | There's also, there's a little red arrow next to the arrow Smith entry.                              |
| 40:20      | And the red arrow indicates that I already have a playlist of arrow Smith tracks.                    |
| 40:25      | But you know, I might want to recreate it.                                                           |
| 40:27      | Now that, now each of those is a column.                                                             |
| 40:29      | The first column with the arrow in it is just empty unless I decide to put a red Unicode             |
| 40:35      | arrow in as the entry, the, the next column with the, with the, with the checkboxes, each,           |
| 40:43      | that column is created.                                                                              |
| 40:45      | And then you have to assign a checkbox button, a, an NS button cell to that, to that column.         |
| 40:55      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 40:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 40:57      | And then the next row where the words are, where the text is, that's just a normal text              |
| 41:01      | column.                                                                                              |
| 41:02      | That's just a normal.                                                                                |
| 41:03      | Now what I tried to do is I tried to use a will display cell delegate, do you know what              |
| 41:07      | that is?                                                                                             |
| 41:08      | I have no idea what that is.                                                                         |
| 41:10      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 41:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 41:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 41:13      | It's a, it's a, it's a delegate to a table view in Cocoa.                                            |
| 41:15      | And what it does is these delegates, they sit there and they wait and watch for the table            |
| 41:19      | to do things.                                                                                        |
| 41:20      | In this particular case, the will display cell says, I'm going to show a cell in the table.          |
| 41:26      | Do you want it to look any particular way?                                                           |
| 41:29      | And so what you do is when you do a will display cell, you get information about the row and,        |
| 41:35      | and you say, okay, if, if this row has a arrow in it, make the text read, right?                     |
| 41:44      | So I wanted to do that, but the will display cell takes so long to process in AppleScript           |
| 41:52      | because it's only, it's one thread.                                                                  |
| 41:54      | So for instance, whenever I included the will display cell delegate, whenever I tried to             |
| 42:00      | resize the window, it would be like, it would move like a half an inch at a time and the             |
| 42:06      | thing is trying to redraw and it's just a mess.                                                      |
| 42:10      | So I said, forget will display cell, just make a column and put an arrow in it and go                |
| 42:15      | have your ice cream and go to bed.                                                                   |
| 42:17      | Have a play that dancing elephant music in the background while you're waiting.                      |
| 42:22      | It's interesting because I like AppleScript is historically slow in comparison to other             |
| 42:27      | because there's so many levels of interaction between the AppleScript and the, the metal            |
| 42:33      | of your computer.                                                                                    |
| 42:34      | But it's never been a problem for me because modern max and my scripts aren't that complicated.      |
| 42:39      | But of course, Doug would write one that, that brings AppleScript to a grinding halt.               |
| 42:43      | I could see that happening.                                                                          |
| 42:45      | Oh, it happens.                                                                                      |
| 42:46      | Unfortunately, it happens frequently, but I know I've learned my lesson.                             |
| 42:49      | It's like, you can't, you can't do too much in the UI because the UI is where everything             |
| 42:55      | runs.                                                                                                |
| 42:56      | Everything goes through that loop.                                                                   |
| 42:58      | So if you're doing big computations, forget it.                                                      |
| 43:01      | Just stop.                                                                                           |
| 43:02      | So, and besides having a nice table like this in an AppleScript, isn't that enough?                 |
| 43:07      | It's gorgeous.                                                                                       |
| 43:08      | Doesn't it look nice?                                                                                |
| 43:09      | Or even just like a search bar in an AppleScript.                                                   |
| 43:12      | Right.                                                                                               |
| 43:13      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 43:14      | I've never written a search bar into an AppleScript.                                                |
| 43:15      | I'm, I think you're, you're inspiring me, I want to go back and look at some of my scripts           |
| 43:20      | and figure out how to add this beautiful box to it, you know?                                        |
| 43:24      | It's so simple to do once you figure it out.                                                         |
| 43:27      | And you can find out how to do all this by looking at old objective C code.                          |
| 43:31      | And that's how I figured it out.                                                                     |
| 43:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 43:33      | I mean, I figured out how to do bindings.                                                            |
| 43:35      | That's a word that a lot of developers are like, oh, bindings, it's really scary.                    |
| 43:39      | But bindings work great here.                                                                        |
| 43:41      | A lot of this stuff is bound.                                                                        |
| 43:42      | Those columns are bound to a, to a data source, the way the filter items work is when you            |
| 43:47      | type something in, the filter predicate is updated for an NS array controller that I'm               |
| 43:52      | using in an AppleScript.                                                                            |
| 43:54      | I mean, the idea that you can use an NS array controller in an AppleScript to me blows              |
| 43:58      | my mind.                                                                                             |
| 43:59      | I've actually used, I've done outline views and used tree controllers, which are even                |
| 44:04      | sure more crazy and browser controllers and things like that.                                        |
| 44:10      | And as long as you don't try to do too much as far as the UI processing, you know, use               |
| 44:15      | a simple, use a simple progress indicator or something so that people know there's something         |
| 44:20      | going on, but you can use most of the processing in the background.                                  |
| 44:26      | You can actually create some, some fairly nice looking things.                                       |
| 44:29      | And because you're using the cocoa frameworks, you can get it to look like these kind of             |
| 44:35      | pretty.                                                                                              |
| 44:36      | And for people who don't want to write a UI where they're going, oh my gosh, cocoa                   |
| 44:39      | frameworks.                                                                                          |
| 44:40      | This sounds scary.                                                                                   |
| 44:41      | A workaround for that, I presume, would be to start with make the user select an artist.             |
| 44:47      | And then you run the script based on the selected artist.                                            |
| 44:50      | And if you don't want to deal with multiple artists, then you just say you can only select           |
| 44:54      | one artist and then go from there.                                                                   |
| 44:56      | You could easily create this in a script editor script.                                              |
| 45:01      | I mean, you could emulate what this does with a single, very small AppleScript.                     |
| 45:07      | But the point is, is to, is to have a nice, elegant little, yeah, it's to have an elegant            |
| 45:13      | little app that does one thing.                                                                      |
| 45:15      | It does it really well.                                                                              |
| 45:17      | And it's nice to look at while you're using it.                                                      |
| 45:19      | It's not this, oh, pick an artist and I'll get all that stuff for you in a second.                   |
| 45:24      | You go make a sandwich.                                                                              |
| 45:25      | You know, I don't like those AppleScripts.                                                          |
| 45:27      | That's the guy.                                                                                      |
| 45:28      | That's my AppleScript guy.                                                                          |
| 45:29      | That's what he sounds like.                                                                          |
| 45:30      | I haven't got fancy enough.                                                                          |
| 45:34      | Because that guy is fun to have around, you know, because you need something done really             |
| 45:37      | quick.                                                                                               |
| 45:38      | But other times when you, if you're going to use something on a regular basis, you don't             |
| 45:40      | want to approach it and be like, oh, I got to use that stupid script I wrote.                        |
| 45:45      | You know, it's, that's bad Feng Shui, man.                                                           |
| 45:46      | That's totally, that's bad.                                                                          |
| 45:48      | So I like to have nice looking, nice looking things.                                                 |
| 45:51      | Well, it is really nice.                                                                             |
| 45:53      | And like another one, I'll tell you one that I like it just, you know, because we knew               |
| 45:57      | we were coming on this show, I've been reading your site more frequently lately.                     |
| 46:02      | And you did one called Divvy up a playlist.                                                          |
| 46:05      | And that is such a great idea.                                                                       |
| 46:06      | So I have this thing with this artist Dexter Gordon, nobody's ever heard of him unless               |
| 46:10      | you're really into jazz, but he's kind of an obscure tenor sax player.                               |
| 46:14      | But when I got into Apple music, I realised that there's a lot of Dexter out there that              |
| 46:20      | I had.                                                                                               |
| 46:21      | I wasn't aware of an Apple music's got a pretty deep library on it.                                  |
| 46:24      | So I've got like 60 or 70 Dexter albums on my library now.                                           |
| 46:30      | And this, but I want to listen to it.                                                                |
| 46:32      | I've got this massive playlist and it's just crazy having something so big.                          |
| 46:37      | And so you created a script that will break a big user created listen, break into smaller            |
| 46:44      | ones.                                                                                                |
| 46:45      | And you can even specify the time.                                                                   |
| 46:46      | So like, let's say I'm like, I want to have at the end of the day, I'm going to clean                |
| 46:49      | my office for 30 minutes.                                                                            |
| 46:51      | I've got my 30 minute Dexter script now built based on this AppleScript, I love it.                 |
| 46:56      | And I'll put a link in the show notes for that as well.                                              |
| 46:59      | But it's just like, I love the ideas you come up with Doug and, and of course, just like             |
| 47:05      | the other one you were just talking about, it's got a beautiful user interface, something            |
| 47:09      | that I'm not capable of creating myself.                                                             |
| 47:12      | But it's just, it's just great.                                                                      |
| 47:13      | And it feels like an app.                                                                            |
| 47:15      | It doesn't feel like an AppleScript.                                                                |
| 47:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:18      | That's the fun part.                                                                                 |
| 47:19      | It's that, that they feel actually even more, more better that they look like apples, that           |
| 47:25      | they look like applications is that they run from the music interface.                               |
| 47:31      | I mean, you can put these in, in the special folder and you can run them from the menu               |
| 47:38      | in music, which to me is, that's it, that's, that's an incredible thing.                             |
| 47:43      | Not many apps do that anymore.                                                                       |
| 47:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:46      | In fact, that used to be a thing where, you know, you could, you could have your scripts             |
| 47:49      | in the menu.                                                                                         |
| 47:50      | People don't do that anymore.                                                                        |
| 47:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:52      | And the great thing about that is you can assign keyboard shortcuts to them.                         |
| 47:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 47:56      | Which is my second favourite thing of all time, because then if you have a script that you're         |
| 47:59      | using all the time or on a regular basis, just assign it a regular keyboard shortcut                 |
| 48:04      | that isn't being already used by music or anything else, and you can fire it off whenever            |
| 48:09      | you want.                                                                                            |
| 48:10      | It's just absolutely amazing.                                                                        |
| 48:11      | That's the stuff that, I'm so glad they kept that.                                                   |
| 48:13      | That's the thing that I'm glad they kept.                                                            |
| 48:15      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 48:16      | Me too.                                                                                              |
| 48:17      | I mean, you can use things like [[FastScripts]] and so on to add them to your menu bar and              |
| 48:21      | to add a keyboard shortcut to them so that they're available globally.                               |
| 48:25      | But you don't necessarily want to do that because I do want some of these things to only             |
| 48:29      | be available in specific applications, mostly iTunes or music as it is now.                          |
| 48:34      | And it's good to, you know, try and narrow that down a little bit.                                   |
| 48:39      | And I've actually got two favourite scripts.                                                          |
| 48:41      | And I realised today that one of them hasn't been updated since 2009 and it's still working,         |
| 48:45      | at least for me.                                                                                     |
| 48:46      | And that is the find a guitar tab or the guitar tab search as it's called.                           |
| 48:52      | Now I actually don't use this to find guitar tabs, I'm currently learning to play the ukulele,       |
| 48:56      | but the ultimate guitar website has ukulele, you know, chords for everything.                        |
| 49:03      | So I'm doing just fine with that.                                                                    |
| 49:06      | But you know, it goes to show, you know, it's not been updated since 2009.                           |
| 49:10      | I may have tweaked it a couple of times over the years, but you know, it's still there               |
| 49:15      | and it works.                                                                                        |
| 49:16      | And I'm pretty happy with that one.                                                                  |
| 49:18      | Rose, I think that was updated.                                                                      |
| 49:19      | That looks like there's a version two from 2019.                                                     |
| 49:22      | But if she's edited the older one to meet her, that's fine.                                          |
| 49:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 49:27      | It's not going to be that much different.                                                            |
| 49:28      | I love those web search ones that I have, it's like, you know, Wikipedia, search Wikipedia.          |
| 49:34      | I'm using that all the time.                                                                         |
| 49:36      | I have that on a shortcut, you know, what is it, option command W or something.                      |
| 49:40      | And so if something's playing and I want to know more about them, search Wikipedia,                  |
| 49:43      | bam.                                                                                                 |
| 49:44      | And it just, you want to search for the album, you want to search for the song, you want             |
| 49:46      | to search for the artist.                                                                            |
| 49:48      | Same thing with your guitar tab thing.                                                               |
| 49:50      | I think it asks for the song and the album or is it just a song?                                     |
| 49:53      | Artist.                                                                                              |
| 49:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 49:55      | So I think the original one that I have is just doing a search based on the name of the              |
| 49:59      | song.                                                                                                |
| 50:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 50:01      | And the new one, which actually I may have to switch to because now David's pointed                  |
| 50:05      | out to me that there is a new one that can search for the song, which is the default                 |
| 50:10      | option or the artist, which is another option, then of course you can cancel if you don't            |
| 50:14      | want to.                                                                                             |
| 50:15      | And that's pretty good.                                                                              |
| 50:16      | And I may have to install the Wikipedia one on my dad's Mac because I was at home this               |
| 50:19      | weekend and we were listening to music and he was there.                                             |
| 50:22      | So whatever happened to this artist?                                                                 |
| 50:23      | And so of course I, you know, I had to say, well, which artist is this?                              |
| 50:26      | I didn't know.                                                                                       |
| 50:28      | And then I had to lift them up on Wikipedia.                                                         |
| 50:29      | It'd be pretty cool if he had a keyboard shortcut to do that.                                        |
| 50:31      | I may boost his iTunes next time he's home, next time I'm back there.                                |
| 50:36      | Terrific.                                                                                            |
| 50:37      | Because that's exactly what I use it for.                                                            |
| 50:38      | It's like, what happened to them?                                                                    |
| 50:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 50:41      | And the other one that I use all the time is Random Full Albums to Playlist.                         |
| 50:48      | And this is great because I get into a rut with my listening and I will credit some of               |
| 50:53      | my recent rut to Aladdin having come out on DVD and so I've been listening to the soundtrack         |
| 50:58      | a lot because it's good and I'm enjoying it.                                                         |
| 51:00      | But to avoid this happening, then I usually try and use the Random Full Albums to Playlist           |
| 51:06      | because that is really helpful for just like, okay, dump some stuff in a playlist.                   |
| 51:10      | I like to listen to things by album usually and then just play through and I'm good.                 |
| 51:16      | That's terrific.                                                                                     |
| 51:17      | That's terrific.                                                                                     |
| 51:18      | I'm glad people still listen to things by album.                                                     |
| 51:19      | One of the things that we've discussed on the podcast that I do is people don't listen               |
| 51:24      | to albums anymore.                                                                                   |
| 51:25      | They listen to tracks and it's funny how music has devolved from, well, it went from singles         |
| 51:33      | to albums.                                                                                           |
| 51:34      | Now we're back to singles again.                                                                     |
| 51:35      | It's kind of strange.                                                                                |
| 51:37      | But I like listening to albums.                                                                      |
| 51:39      | Yeah, and that podcast, by the way, is The Next Track with Kirk McElhearn, who's a really              |
| 51:44      | well-respected journalist that writes about [[Apple]] all the time.                                      |
| 51:49      | Where's Kirk writing these days?                                                                     |
| 51:50      | I'm not sure where he's at.                                                                          |
| 51:53      | He still writes.                                                                                     |
| 51:54      | He does stuff for Tidbits.                                                                           |
| 51:55      | He writes for, I believe he writes regularly for [Intego](https://intego.com).                                             |
| 51:59      | He posts security information on there.                                                              |
| 52:01      | He still does a lot of freelancing.                                                                  |
| 52:03      | He's got a great book on Taken.                                                                      |
| 52:05      | You have a Take Control book too, don't you love her?                                                |
| 52:07      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 52:08      | I share a publisher there.                                                                           |
| 52:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 52:10      | He has a book on the media apps that just came out that updates everybody on the differences         |
| 52:16      | between iTunes and music and TV and podcasts and book and whatever other apps they have.             |
| 52:21      | Whatever apps they were able to pull out of iTunes, there was like 37 of them just waiting           |
| 52:26      | to come out and hatch.                                                                               |
| 52:27      | Well, it's called the next track.                                                                    |
| 52:29      | I may have to check it out because I know Kirk collects a lot of classical music and                 |
| 52:32      | that guy pushes iTunes or now music probably to the limit.                                           |
| 52:36      | He used to be the iTunes guy at Macworld.                                                            |
| 52:39      | I've told him from now on, you're, send your music out.                                              |
| 52:42      | There you go.                                                                                        |
| 52:43      | I like that.                                                                                         |
| 52:44      | I like that.                                                                                         |
| 52:45      | I like it.                                                                                           |
| 52:46      | He doesn't like it, but I like it.                                                                   |
| 52:47      | So we're going to skip it.                                                                           |
| 52:48      | He's outvoted at this point.                                                                         |
| 52:51      | This episode of The Automators is brought to you by PDFpen from Smile.                               |
| 52:56      | The ultimate tool for editing PDFs on the Mac.                                                       |
| 53:00      | Just go to textexpander.com and let them know you heard about it here on The Automators.              |
| 53:06      | PDFpen and PDFpen Pro is the ultimate PDF viewing and editing application for the Mac.               |
| 53:12      | With it, you can add headers and footers along with watermarks to your documents.                    |
| 53:16      | That also includes a precision edit tool, plus you can OCR documents.                                |
| 53:21      | And version 11.2 is now available with table cell content editing.                                   |
| 53:27      | You know, one of the things I love about PDFpen, they actually have a redaction tool.                |
| 53:31      | You know, you draw a black square around someone's social security number and it actually removes    |
| 53:35      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 53:36      | You can see how often people just draw a black square.                                               |
| 53:39      | Then someone receives the PDF, they remove the black square and they have the social                 |
| 53:42      | security number.                                                                                     |
| 53:43      | That doesn't happen with PDFpen.                                                                     |
| 53:45      | And now you can add signatures and text, not to mention being able to correct typos                  |
| 53:50      | and fill out forms.                                                                                  |
| 53:52      | So check out the new version 11.2 of PDFpen and PDFpen Pro for your Mac.                             |

| 54:02      | Let them know you heard about it here on The Automators.                                             |
| 54:04      | And if you do any work with PDFs, you need PDFpen.                                                   |
| 54:09      | So Doug, you spent all this time in AppleScript all these years.                                     |
| 54:14      | Are there any other automation languages that pique your interests?                                  |
| 54:18      | Well, I do like any programming language.                                                            |
| 54:24      | I mentioned earlier, you know, it's always good to know a little Objective-C and [[Swift]].              |
| 54:28      | And to be honest with you, I haven't learned any [[Swift]] at all.                                       |
| 54:31      | I haven't done anything, as I mentioned earlier, with Shortcuts, which is some automation that       |
| 54:36      | I would like to get involved in.                                                                     |
| 54:37      | I would really like to do more with home automation.                                                 |
| 54:43      | That's something I should have asked you guys about because you probably know more about             |
| 54:45      | it than I do.                                                                                        |
| 54:46      | But I've recently, I don't have many opportunities for that here because we live in an apartment     |
| 54:52      | in suburban, outside of Boston, in this big suburban Newton.                                         |
| 54:57      | And we don't have like a modern home.                                                                |
| 55:00      | It's an older house.                                                                                 |
| 55:02      | There's no recessed lighting.                                                                        |
| 55:03      | There's no, you know, there's no opportunities for nice lighting.                                    |
| 55:07      | It's like we have localised, direct lighting pretty much everywhere.                                 |
| 55:10      | So automating that doesn't, it doesn't really give us many opportunities.                            |
| 55:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:15      | And you can't start pulling sockets out of the walls and stuff because you're in an apartment.             |
| 55:19      | Right, exactly.                                                                                      |
| 55:20      | We have a little bit of home automation, but, and that's only because I was interested               |
| 55:24      | in finding out how, you know, what we can do with it.                                                |
| 55:28      | But, you know, [[HomeKit]] is not AppleScriptable.                                                      |
| 55:32      | And so, I mean, and that's perfectly understandable because the security risks are just, I mean,     |
| 55:37      | just think about it for a second.                                                                    |
| 55:39      | So I understand that.                                                                                |
| 55:40      | But the only time I've used automation with these lights is when we first got these lights           |
| 55:47      | that are controllable.                                                                               |
| 55:49      | They're not Phillips Hue, they're feet, have you ever heard of them?                                 |
| 55:52      | Yeah, that's a lot of it.                                                                            |
| 55:53      | Okay, well anyway, they're one of these vendors.                                                     |
| 55:57      | And we put the lights in the bedroom thinking that, well, we each have our own light.                |
| 56:01      | We can set it at its own temperature and we can do the dimming and all that stuff.                   |
| 56:05      | And we found that that was just a pain in the butt.                                                  |
| 56:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 56:08      | It's like we went back to using the dimmers that we had because it was easier to, when               |
| 56:12      | you're half asleep to reach over and grab the dimmer, you didn't have to look for your               |
| 56:15      | fumble for your phone, turn it on, hold it up in front of your face, say, okay, turn                 |
| 56:19      | this off now, or even do, hey, Siri, because Siri, no offense, Siri, but Siri would sometimes        |
| 56:25      | get it wrong and, you know, you're talking while somebody is in bed, it just, it just                |
| 56:29      | didn't.                                                                                              |
| 56:30      | Your faces have smushed into a pillow because you're half asleep, you know, there's a, yeah,         |
| 56:35      | plenty of potential for it to go wrong.                                                              |
| 56:36      | I'm sure there are all kinds of horror stories, yes.                                                 |
| 56:39      | So, but I am interested in home automation as far as it goes with music and, you know,               |
| 56:46      | in lights and air conditioning and microwaves and whatever else they come out with.                  |
| 56:51      | So I'm very curious to see how that comes out, but I haven't had any opportunities to                |
| 56:54      | do any because, like I said, kind of limited here with what we can do.                               |
| 56:57      | Yeah, I feel like [[HomeKit]] is like, to use the earlier AppleScript versus Automator analogy,          |
| 57:04      | I think at [[HomeKit]] leans kind of the Automator speed as opposed to the AppleScript speed when        |
| 57:09      | it comes to home automation.                                                                         |
| 57:12      | There are people out there that, you know, sell services and go real deep with home automation       |
| 57:16      | to do a lot more.                                                                                    |
| 57:18      | But for me, I find that actually, you know, the Automator level is probably fine for most            |
| 57:24      | of the home automation I do, but I do have the ability to like, and the game changer                 |
| 57:30      | for me with the lighting was the [[Lutron]] Caseta switches, which requires you to rewire your         |
| 57:37      | house.                                                                                               |
| 57:38      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 57:39      | But automation for lighting in the light bulb is far inferior to automation handled at the           |
| 57:44      | switch level.                                                                                        |
| 57:45      | Because, you know, if you do it in the light bulb, you've got to buy one of these fancy              |
| 57:49      | light bulbs for every light, and you're still going to hit the switch once in a while when           |
| 57:54      | you hit the switch.                                                                                  |
| 57:55      | Guess what?                                                                                          |
| 57:56      | You just turned the automation off because there's no current going to that.                         |
| 58:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 58:01      | Is there a show like Bad Automators?                                                                 |
| 58:03      | You should have like a companion show where it's like home automation nightmares.                    |
| 58:11      | That's where we're at, I think.                                                                      |
| 58:12      | When I broke up my ankle last year, some people came over to help out and, you know, bring           |
| 58:17      | groceries and so on, and they kept trying to turn the lights on in the hallway with                  |
| 58:21      | the light switches, and we have Philips Hue lights.                                                  |
| 58:24      | And so ages ago, it used to be that if you turned the light switch off for Philips Hue               |
| 58:28      | lights and then turned it back on, then the lights would come on.                                    |
| 58:33      | But this was a pain in the neck when you had a like brief power flicker at 3 a.m.                    |
| 58:38      | Because they would lose power, and then they come back on and you'd be lying in bed.                 |
| 58:42      | And previously, you know, with regular lighting, you would be unaware of this, with Philips          |
| 58:47      | Hue lighting, it would be like, and the sun has come out to play, and all of your lights             |
| 58:51      | are on, and you're blinded, and now you're wide awake and very grumpy about it.                      |
| 58:56      | So fortunately, that was fixed, but people were flipping the light switches, and oh                  |
| 59:00      | my gosh, it took like 10 minutes of me like standing there on one leg, like press the                |
| 59:05      | light switch.                                                                                        |
| 59:06      | And then I had to hop back to the Philips Hue bridge and reboot it because that was                  |
| 59:10      | being funny because it can connect to some of the lights, and it was taking a long time,             |
| 59:14      | and oh my gosh, that was a pain.                                                                     |
| 59:16      | All you have to do is just take that segment out and put a beginning and an ending on it,            |
| 59:20      | and there's your first nightmare home automators episode.                                            |
| 59:23      | Well, I mean, I fixed it because I put tape on the light switches now, so you can try                |
| 59:28      | and toggle them all you like, but you know, unless you rip the tape off, it's not going              |
| 59:33      | to happen, and I was actually pretty tempted to pull the switches off the wall.                      |
| 59:36      | We live in an apartment, but I think I could get away with pulling the switches off the              |
| 59:39      | wall and just like recessing the actual switch part further behind, and then like putting            |
| 59:44      | the switch back so people can toggle it all they like, and it wouldn't actually do anything.         |
| 59:48      | Maybe in the future.                                                                                 |
| 59:49      | Years from now, people will be renting that apartment and will say, hey look, they have              |
| 59:53      | switches back here.                                                                                  |
| 59:55      | That'd be funny.                                                                                     |
| 59:56      | At one point, I actually opened up the wall and disconnected the switch because I was                |
| 01:00:01   | tired of my family turning all the lights off, but then, of course, they're like, well,              |
| 01:00:06   | how am I supposed to turn the light on?                                                              |
| 01:00:08   | You expect me to open an app?                                                                        |
| 01:00:11   | That was all before I kind of saw the light with the Casetas, and I think one of the                |
| 01:00:16   | rules if you're going to automate, especially if you live with another person, is you've             |
| 01:00:20   | got to find a solution that does not upset their life in one bit.                                    |
| 01:00:24   | And I think that a winning automation has to do that.                                                |
| 01:00:27   | It has to not only work for the nerd, it has to work for the non-nerd.                               |
| 01:00:31   | The way it worked at our house is my wife decided that she wanted to be able to control              |
| 01:00:35   | the lights on the other end of the apartment that we hardly ever went into anymore.                  |
| 01:00:40   | So she bought an Alexa device without even consulting me.                                            |
| 01:00:45   | She just got it and said, now this is supposed to help us with the lights.                           |
| 01:00:49   | Is this going to, can you make this work?                                                            |
| 01:00:51   | I'm like, okay, well, oh yeah, I got to get some other things, but yeah, I can make it               |
| 01:00:55   | work.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:56   | So I had no choice.                                                                                  |
| 01:00:57   | I was not prepared to do any home automating until she actually decided that this is the             |
| 01:01:01   | way things are going to be.                                                                          |
| 01:01:02   | And the motto at my house is happy wife, happy life.                                                 |
| 01:01:05   | Yeah, that's pretty universal.                                                                       |
| 01:01:07   | Got to do it.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:08   | That's pretty universal.                                                                             |
| 01:01:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:10   | I mean, it's literally a motto.                                                                      |
| 01:01:11   | It's literally, you walk in the house, it's written right there.                                     |
| 01:01:13   | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:14   | Did you script that?                                                                                 |
| 01:01:15   | Well, in my case, I had to make my boyfriend happy because he's not a fan of, you know,              |
| 01:01:19   | like not having light switches and things like that and he doesn't want to have to get               |
| 01:01:23   | out his phone and especially he has an Android.                                                      |
| 01:01:26   | So that means that he doesn't even just have one app to deal with stuff because there is             |
| 01:01:30   | no home app for Android, which integrates the Nanoleaf and the Hue and the [[Logitech Harmony\|Logitech Harmony]]                 |
| 01:01:36   | for the television, everything.                                                              |
| 01:01:39   | So the [[Logitech Harmony]] that I bought, I bought with remote control and I hooked it up to            |
| 01:01:44   | the Hue lighting and everything.                                                                     |
| 01:01:45   | So when we start watching, you know, a film or something, then it dims the lights for                |
| 01:01:49   | some things like that, but I bought the Logitech Pop Buttons.                                        |
| 01:01:52   | And that I think has been the winner because there's one next to the bed and you press               |
| 01:01:56   | that one and it turns off all the lights in the apartment, everything.                               |
| 01:01:59   | Oh, terrific.                                                                                        |
| 01:02:00   | And also, the speakers, because we have a Sonos speaker and things like that, the one                 |
| 01:02:03   | by the front door, exactly the same, you hit it on the way out, turns everything off.                |
| 01:02:07   | So aside from the lights in the bathroom, which I have not automated because they're                 |
| 01:02:11   | in the bathroom and I kind of don't want to risk Phillips Hue in a very humid environment,           |
| 01:02:16   | our bathroom is very poor ventilation, unfortunately, you know, and the bathroom's next to the       |
| 01:02:20   | front door.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:21   | So if that light's still on, you can lean backwards, hit the switch and then continue                |
| 01:02:25   | on your way out.                                                                                     |
| 01:02:26   | But that's been really useful and also having the ability to press one button when you               |
| 01:02:30   | come back in and your hands are full of groceries, so you can elbow it and turn the lights on        |
| 01:02:35   | and keep going to the kitchen and the entire apartment's lighting up as you're walking               |
| 01:02:38   | through it.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:39   | That really has been a game changer and has made our life considerably easier.                       |
| 01:02:43   | I'm sure that's really cool.                                                                         |
| 01:02:44   | And like I said, I wish I could do stuff like that, but the opportunities for us to do               |
| 01:02:48   | that are just, it's like, we live on the second floor, so when we come in, we pull the string        |
| 01:02:53   | that turns the light on at the top of the thing, at the top of the stairs.                           |
| 01:02:57   | That's our home automation.                                                                          |
| 01:03:00   | You know, I'd love the idea of turning things off when I leave the room.                             |
| 01:03:04   | I think that makes a lot more sense and I'd love to be able to do that and that's what               |
| 01:03:09   | I would do.                                                                                          |
| 01:03:10   | I think that's the least that I should be able to do, so I'm going to try to work on                 |
| 01:03:14   | that.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:15   | Well, you could easily do that with your little home studio.                                         |
| 01:03:17   | I'm looking at it right now.                                                                         |
| 01:03:19   | You just get yourself a hue light and you get one of those infrared sensors and in home              |
| 01:03:24   | kit on your phone, you can have it when there's infrared motion in the room, it'll turn the          |
| 01:03:30   | light on.                                                                                            |
| 01:03:31   | You can even set it to, say, turn off if there's no motion after 10 minutes, so you walk out         |
| 01:03:34   | the door 10 minutes later.                                                                           |
| 01:03:36   | So that is absolutely doable with just the basic stuff built into your phone.                        |
| 01:03:41   | Just the script editor version of it.                                                                |
| 01:03:43   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 01:03:44   | Yeah, with the automated version.                                                                    |
| 01:03:46   | Yeah, you could just, you could have it turn on light based on motion very easily.                   |
| 01:03:53   | The trick for me, like I said, once I got the cassette of switches and my family started             |
| 01:03:56   | using them, it was like the gateway drug.                                                            |
| 01:03:58   | So then my wife discovered the app and the ability and I know now, even like when we'll              |
| 01:04:02   | be driving home at night, she'll be turning the lights on in the house as we're two blocks           |
| 01:04:06   | away.                                                                                                |
| 01:04:08   | And then I slowly started adding things to it.                                                       |
| 01:04:11   | We have a thermostat now and we also have the ability to unlock our front door with                  |
| 01:04:15   | it and she uses all that stuff, but the trick was really getting those switches because              |
| 01:04:21   | when we were trying to do it with the light bulb stuff, I was getting, I did not have                |
| 01:04:25   | a happy wife and happy life in terms of that element of my life.                                     |
| 01:04:29   | So you do need to find a way, whether your significant other is not listening to the                 |
| 01:04:35   | Automator's podcast, you need to figure out a way to make them happy too when you're trying          |
| 01:04:39   | this stuff.                                                                                          |
| 01:04:41   | I think so because she does my laundry too, so it's like, I gotta keep that.                         |
| 01:04:46   | Yes, if you don't want your t-shirt shrunk, then you have to make sure that everybody                |
| 01:04:51   | else in your life is happy.                                                                          |
| 01:04:53   | Really careful about stuff like that.                                                                |
| 01:04:55   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:56   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:57   | That's one of the reasons why at the moment my parents only have one plug.                           |
| 01:05:00   | It's a Elgato Eve plug and that is, it's a place where it would be a very awkward place              |
| 01:05:06   | to physically, you know, reach down there every time to turn the light on and turn the               |
| 01:05:10   | light off and they have a lamp plugged into it, 99% of the year.                                     |
| 01:05:14   | And then a Christmas, I'm not sure they're supposed to do this, but they put an extension            |
| 01:05:18   | lead on it and have a lamp and the Christmas tree.                                                   |
| 01:05:21   | And so the lamp and the Christmas tree come on at the same time when they ask the lady               |
| 01:05:25   | inside their phones or usually their Apple watches.                                                  |
| 01:05:27   | And occasionally their iPads I noticed this weekend to turn on the lamp.                             |
| 01:05:31   | And that they really like because it also means that, you know, if they're out and they've           |
| 01:05:35   | forgotten because they do have an [[Apple TV]], if they've forgotten that, you know, to turn             |
| 01:05:40   | the lamp off or they think, did we remember to turn the lamp off?                                    |
| 01:05:43   | They can open their phones and look at it and turn it off.                                           |
| 01:05:47   | That was also useful a couple of months ago when I was trying to call my parents and they            |
| 01:05:50   | weren't answering their phones and I wasn't sure why.                                                |
| 01:05:53   | So I started turning the lamp off, waiting for them to turn the lamp back on and then                |
| 01:05:57   | my mom said, the lamp keeps turning off.                                                             |
| 01:05:58   | What's happening?                                                                                    |
| 01:05:59   | It's like, good.                                                                                     |
| 01:06:00   | Now you can see that I've called you eight times and you haven't picked up.                          |
| 01:06:03   | What's happening?                                                                                    |
| 01:06:04   | Oh, right.                                                                                           |
| 01:06:05   | Sorry.                                                                                               |
| 01:06:06   | And then they called me and it was fine.                                                             |
| 01:06:07   | So there we go.                                                                                      |
| 01:06:08   | I hadn't thought of the April Fool's potential here.                                                 |
| 01:06:11   | Well, I wasn't using it to play a prank on them.                                                     |
| 01:06:15   | I really didn't need to talk to them and they weren't picking up the phone, but, you know.           |
| 01:06:18   | Of course.                                                                                           |
| 01:06:19   | Yeah, okay.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:20   | There are bonuses to this.                                                                           |
| 01:06:21   | I have a friend that lives in Los Angeles and when the Dodgers win, her bedroom light                |
| 01:06:25   | turns blue.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:28   | I helped her set that up with an if, this, then that.                                                |
| 01:06:31   | She's not super in automation, but man, she loves it so much.                                        |
| 01:06:34   | Whenever it occasionally breaks, I get a call from her and then we forget to fix.                    |
| 01:06:39   | It's real great.                                                                                     |
| 01:06:40   | I tried recently to put one of those wireless plugs on my router because I just occasionally         |
| 01:06:46   | want to reset my router.                                                                             |
| 01:06:47   | I thought it'd be nice to be able to turn it off.                                                    |
| 01:06:49   | You know, I wondered about that too, yeah.                                                           |
| 01:06:51   | The problem is the wattage that it pulls is too high and it seems to be shutting the                 |
| 01:06:56   | router down randomly.                                                                                |
| 01:06:57   | So I have to get, they make them more with higher wattage and I just have to spend money,            |
| 01:07:01   | you know, but I haven't done it yet, but that, I think that someone that can make Doug's             |
| 01:07:07   | scripts could probably go crazy, in fact, we're going to have you back on some day, Doug,            |
| 01:07:10   | and we're going to hear how you've [[AppleScript\|AppleScript-ed]] your home automation.                              |
| 01:07:14   | I remember when I was a kid, there was a book for kids, I think it was called Henry or something,    |
| 01:07:19   | but he had to stay home one day from school and he had a big ball of string and he attached          |
| 01:07:26   | everything that he thought he would need at home to the end of a string and he could bring           |
| 01:07:31   | it into his bed while he, well, you know, while he was sick, while he was recuperating               |
| 01:07:36   | from school, I thought, I want to be able to do that someday.                                        |
| 01:07:38   | Yeah, the original automated.                                                                        |
| 01:07:39   | Yeah, so it's certainly possible that, you know, with that as my, as my, as my, as my                |
| 01:07:47   | ideal, I will, you know, automate my home like, like he did, because I really like the               |
| 01:07:53   | idea of having centralised control.                                                                  |
| 01:07:55   | I wonder if there's an interface, there's, they call it with the X10 modules, there's,               |
| 01:08:00   | there's some, there's some old school automation stuff out there that I wouldn't be surprised        |
| 01:08:05   | if somebody wrote an AppleScript addressable Mac app for, you know, if anybody in the audience      |
| 01:08:11   | knows, send Doug a note over Doug's scripts.                                                         |
| 01:08:13   | Yeah, I'd be curious to know, because I remember that I almost got into that stuff.                  |
| 01:08:17   | And there was some way you could do something like that.                                             |
| 01:08:22   | And now I don't remember.                                                                            |
| 01:08:23   | But I came that close to saying, maybe I should invest in doing some of that.                        |
| 01:08:27   | But at that time, the whole modem, it was way too early.                                             |
| 01:08:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:08:31   | Way too early.                                                                                       |
| 01:08:32   | Well, either way, we are all big fans of everything you do, Doug.                                    |
| 01:08:36   | I mean, it's 20 years of making AppleScripts for us to make our music libraries better,             |
| 01:08:41   | but you've also taught a lot of us AppleScript along the way, and we sure appreciate                |
| 01:08:44   | it.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:45   | Well, super.                                                                                         |
| 01:08:46   | That's great.                                                                                        |
| 01:08:47   | That's very gratifying.                                                                              |

| 01:08:57   | Also, the podcast is called The Next Track, we'll put a link for that as well in the show            |
| 01:09:02   | notes.                                                                                               |
| 01:09:03   | We've talked about a bunch of Doug's scripts during the course of the show.                              |
| 01:09:06   | We're going to have those in the show notes.                                                         |
| 01:09:08   | Anywhere else people should look for you, Doug?                                                      |
| 01:09:10   | Don't bother.                                                                                        |
| 01:09:11   | I'm on Twitter @dougscripts, and that's about it.                                                   |
| 01:09:15   | Yeah, I was on Facebook, but I burned that bridge.                                                   |
| 01:09:17   | Yeah, me too.                                                                                        |
| 01:09:18   | Me too.                                                                                              |
| 01:09:19   | Good for you.                                                                                        |

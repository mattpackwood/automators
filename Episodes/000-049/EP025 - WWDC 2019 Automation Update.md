| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators.                                                                      |
| 00:04      | I am Rosemary Orchard and this week's episode is brought to you from San Jose where I am              |
| 00:09      | sitting across from a suitcase with David.                                                            |
| 00:12      | Hello David.                                                                                          |
| 00:13      | Rose, it's not only a suitcase, it's a suitcase with my shoes on it to prop up microphones.           |
| 00:19      | There will be a picture of this in the show notes for anybody who is very curious.                    |
| 00:23      | It is a weird recording setup, but it's working.                                                      |
| 00:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:27      | So both of us got to San Jose, Rose came down and visited me in Southern California for               |
| 00:31      | a few days before we came up.                                                                         |
| 00:33      | And Rose, you've had a little problem here in San Jose, haven't you?                                  |
| 00:38      | Just a little problem.                                                                                |
| 00:40      | So they have these scooters everywhere, which are really good fun.                                    |
| 00:43      | They are so much fun.                                                                                 |
| 00:45      | And so I got on some scooters with some friends.                                                      |
| 00:48      | We were going to go to have dinner together and it was great.                                         |
| 00:51      | And we turned a corner off of a bike lane onto a pedestrian street and then there was                 |
| 00:56      | a leaf.                                                                                               |
| 00:57      | I have never been so surprised by a leaf in my life because it flew into my wheel.                    |
| 01:02      | My wheel lost traction and I slammed into the ground.                                                 |
| 01:05      | So I have a sprained ankle right now, which is great fun.                                             |
| 01:08      | She's got a sprained ankle.                                                                           |
| 01:10      | She's got a wrist strap.                                                                              |
| 01:11      | I mean, gang, Rose is literally bleeding for you here to bring you the latest automator's             |
| 01:17      | news.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18      | But I have to say I've still had a great week despite the injuries.                                   |
| 01:23      | So I'm doing very well.                                                                               |
| 01:25      | And the good news is I'm looking at her ankle now.                                                    |
| 01:27      | It's a lot smaller than it was a few days ago.                                                        |
| 01:29      | So we think she's going to survive.                                                                   |
| 01:31      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:33      | There's no amputation possibilities here.                                                             |
| 01:34      | We're not going to lose Rose.                                                                         |
| 01:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:36      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:38      | It's been a great week in San Jose for [[WWDC]].                                                          |
| 01:40      | It was really fun.                                                                                    |
| 01:41      | We're going to talk at the end of the episode about the meet up and just the general vibe              |
| 01:45      | here at [[WWDC]].                                                                                         |
| 01:47      | It's been great, but it's been wonderful seeing all the automator's fans out there.                   |
| 01:52      | There's a ton of you, especially in this environment.                                                 |
| 01:56      | So we thank you all for that.                                                                         |
| 01:59      | Also was one other bit of news is the Mac Power users scored a big win this year.                     |
| 02:03      | We got to interview the product manager for the new Mac Pros.                                         |
| 02:07      | So if you're interested at all in that, even just to kind of get an idea of what [[Apple|Apple's]]              |
| 02:11      | thinking with those fancy new Macs, go over and listen to the latest episode of Mac Power             |
| 02:16      | Users.                                                                                                |
| 02:17      | I'll put it in the show notes.                                                                        |
| 02:18      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 02:19      | And you'll find out what the product manager of the Mac Pros first Mac was, which is a                |
| 02:24      | cliffhanger I'm going to leave you with.                                                              |
| 02:26      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 02:27      | But we're here to talk about automation.                                                              |
| 02:30      | And for today's episode, we thought what we'd do is just kind of share the automation                 |
| 02:34      | news coming out of [[WWDC]].                                                                              |
| 02:37      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 02:38      | And let's just say we are going to be going through it fast, not quite as fast as the                 |
| 02:43      | keynote went, where within 10 minutes they've moved on from watchOS, but there's a lot                |
| 02:49      | of things to cover here.                                                                              |
| 02:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 02:51      | The first thing, I mean, this year at [[WWDC]], it seems in particular, [[Apple]] had a lot of                |
| 02:55      | big news, [[SwiftUI]], the new Mac Pros, they just had a lot of really big items to cover.               |
| 03:01      | And as a result, automation didn't get the love it did last year, you know, [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]                |
| 03:06      | was a big feature of the keynote last year, whereas this year it didn't even get                 |
| 03:11      | mentioned in the keynote.                                                                             |
| 03:12      | It was it was mentioned in the state of the union.                                                    |
| 03:16      | And so from the outside, you may think, oh, they didn't do much this year.                            |
| 03:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 03:20      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 03:21      | It's just because they had such big news that this news kind of got buried.                           |
| 03:26      | And Rose and I have both had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time this week with              |
| 03:30      | the [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] team and some of the other [[Automator]] folks at [[Apple]].                              |
| 03:33      | They're super proud.                                                                                  |
| 03:35      | And I would argue in a lot of ways, the news we're about to share with you about Siri Short           |
| 03:40      | Cuts.                                                                                                 |
| 03:41      | Well, I guess last year was amazing because it existed.                                               |
| 03:44      | But this year is so much better.                                                                      |
| 03:47      | It's a whole new level.                                                                               |
| 03:48      | I feel like, you know, it's kind of when you planted a flower and the first year it needs             |
| 03:53      | you know, it needs time for the roots to take hold before it really takes off.                        |
| 03:57      | Well, this year, [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] is in full bloom because there there's just an incredible            |
| 04:03      | amount of new stuff we're going to be able to do with [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]].                                |
| 04:07      | Automation is going to get easier, more powerful and stronger.                                        |
| 04:10      | But before we, that was a tease, Rose, because I think before we do that, let's just talk             |
| 04:14      | briefly about Mac OS.                                                                                 |
| 04:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:17      | There's not a whole lot of news on Mac OS.                                                            |
| 04:19      | I mean, there is, because a lot of people have heard, and this was rumoured before [[WWDC]],               |
| 04:23      | that iTunes is going away.                                                                            |
| 04:26      | With Mac OS Catalina, iTunes is no more.                                                              |
| 04:28      | So there's music, there's TV, there's podcasts, they're all separate applications now.                |
| 04:34      | And when just for the people very concerned about saying, if you plug your device into                |
| 04:37      | your Mac, then it comes up in the sidebar and that's how you, in Finder, and that's                   |
| 04:41      | how you sync things.                                                                                  |
| 04:43      | But what a lot of people would be concerned about is their scripts for iTunes that they               |
| 04:47      | had to do things with their music.                                                                    |
| 04:48      | And there's a great website called Doug Scripts that I'll make sure we link in the show notes.        |
| 04:53      | And the really good news is those scripting libraries have been imported to the music                 |
| 04:57      | and the TV apps.                                                                                      |
| 04:58      | They have not got rid of these scripting opportunities.                                               |
| 05:01      | So if you're using that, you don't need to worry.                                                     |
| 05:04      | There may need to be changes to these scripts so that they talk to music or TV versus iTunes.         |
| 05:10      | But it's [[AppleScript]].                                                                                |
| 05:11      | You can probably run a Finder replace and fix that, because [[AppleScript]] is a very friendly           |
| 05:15      | language for that.                                                                                    |
| 05:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:17      | And both of us, neither one of us have loaded the Catalina beta yet.                                  |
| 05:21      | I believe Rose is shaking her head now.                                                               |
| 05:23      | No, not yet.                                                                                          |
| 05:24      | I mean, one of the things about being here is the Wi-Fi is terrible everywhere.                       |
| 05:29      | And honestly, it's never a good idea to load a beta when you're on a trip.                            |
| 05:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 05:36      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 05:37      | Terrible idea.                                                                                        |
| 05:38      | Don't do it, people.                                                                                  |
| 05:39      | So we're going to get into this deeper.                                                               |
| 05:40      | We'll be talking about it in future episodes.                                                         |
| 05:42      | But the good news is you do get to retain some of your scripting on the stuff you're doing            |
| 05:46      | on Mac.                                                                                               |
| 05:47      | But one of the stories I had in the back of my mind, I never really said it publicly                  |
| 05:52      | because I didn't want to jinx it, but I was really kind of hoping we'd get Siri Shortcuts             |
| 05:56      | on Mac this year with this project Catalyst.                                                          |
| 06:00      | It seems to me that it's possible that we'll get it at some point in the future.                      |
| 06:03      | But this wasn't the year for it.                                                                      |
| 06:06      | So the big automator news and the focus of this episode really is iOS and now iPadOS.                 |
| 06:12      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 06:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 06:14      | Because these have been split up a little bit.                                                        |
| 06:16      | They're very much siblings that were born very close together.                                        |
| 06:19      | They may even be in the same school year at school.                                                   |
| 06:22      | That's how close they are, but they're not the same person anymore, which is great.                   |
| 06:25      | Well, I mean, it's never really been the same.                                                        |
| 06:27      | I mean, there's always been things you could do on iPad that you can do on the phone and              |
| 06:31      | vice versa.                                                                                           |
| 06:32      | But I do appreciate that [[Apple]] now has a separate and if you haven't heard this yet, they have        |
| 06:37      | what they call iPadOS versus iOS, which is kind of funny.                                             |
| 06:41      | Historically, originally it was iPhoneOS when they first made the iPhone and then they made           |
| 06:46      | a big deal.                                                                                           |
| 06:47      | I think it was around iOS 3 that they were.                                                           |
| 06:49      | And I think that was partly because of the iPad.                                                      |
| 06:51      | They were just going to call it iOS going forward.                                                    |
| 06:54      | But either way, now that iPadOS is its own thing, I feel like they're going to have to                |
| 06:59      | be beholden to give us updates.                                                                       |
| 07:01      | And maybe that even means there's a team just dedicated to solving and taking the rough               |
| 07:07      | messages off the iPad.                                                                                |
| 07:10      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 07:11      | It's kind of fun podcasting with you in person.                                                       |
| 07:13      | I can actually look at you.                                                                           |
| 07:14      | We can look at each other and we're hopefully going to make the editing of this podcast               |
| 07:18      | easier because we're not talking over each other like we would do usually.                            |
| 07:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 07:23      | I know that all of the possibilities from this and really, I think it does make things                |
| 07:28      | a little easier, especially for us because everybody who uses the iPad a lot and I know               |
| 07:33      | if a lot of the people listening may only have an iPhone, Shortcuts really is a great                 |
| 07:38      | app on the iPad because you can just see so much more.                                                |
| 07:41      | I recently got an iPad mini and it's great even like the 7.9 inch screen because you                  |
| 07:47      | can see that much more and it's great that iPad specifically will be getting features                 |
| 07:52      | just for it every year now.                                                                           |
| 07:54      | And I think everybody is very excited about that.                                                     |
| 07:57      | Hey, Rosa, before we just real quick, before we get into all that new great new series                |
| 08:01      | shortcut stuff, how do you like that new iPad?                                                        |
| 08:04      | The mini, it's adorable.                                                                              |
| 08:05      | I actually called it the iPad Adorable.                                                               |
| 08:07      | Thank you very much to JF for said who helped me name it.                                             |
| 08:11      | It's very nice.                                                                                       |
| 08:12      | It's portable.                                                                                        |
| 08:13      | It fits in my smallest of handbags literally that was one of the criteria and it's great              |
| 08:19      | because I can thumb type on it in portrait mode, even with a slightly sprained wrist,                 |
| 08:24      | which makes it a great iPad.                                                                          |
| 08:28      | If you want an iPad and you think that you're probably not going to take it too many places           |
| 08:33      | and so on, I would still encourage looking at the mini just because it is so portable.                |
| 08:38      | It's the sort of thing you will end up taking everywhere because it fits in everything.               |
| 08:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 08:43      | I was sitting next to Rosa on an airplane looking at her use the iPad mini and the green              |
| 08:49      | envy took over me for just a few minutes.                                                             |
| 08:51      | I should point out that at this point in time, David was using 11-inch iPad, so it's not              |
| 08:55      | like he was struggling with a 15-inch MacBook Pro that couldn't fit on the airplane tray              |
| 08:59      | table, but yeah, it is very small and portable.                                                       |
| 09:03      | It's so cute though.                                                                                  |
| 09:04      | It is adorable and I got the Logitech Crayon to use with it as well, which is really nice.            |
| 09:08      | More importantly, tell them what colour you got.                                                       |
| 09:10      | I got the gold one.                                                                                   |
| 09:11      | Of course you did.                                                                                    |
| 09:12      | Yeah, it's free.                                                                                      |
| 09:13      | Hey, so we're going to talk about [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]], lots of news to share.                            |
| 09:17      | Before we do, I want to talk about our first sponsor and that's our friends over at Timing.           |
| 09:21      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Timing, the app that tracks your time automatically   |
| 09:26      | instead of manually.                                                                                  |
| 09:27      | So let's talk about why you should be tracking your time.                                             |
| 09:30      | For anyone billing your hours, that's obvious, but even if you're employed by yourself or             |
| 09:36      | billing per project, you need to estimate how long a specific task is going to take.                  |
| 09:41      | Time tracking helps you stay on track with those estimates.                                           |
| 09:45      | To make sure you don't end up in the red with your projects and that can help make more               |
| 09:48      | accurate estimates in the future.                                                                     |
| 09:50      | One of the big benefits I get out of time tracking is I identify those areas of my life               |
| 09:55      | that don't really need me.                                                                            |
| 09:57      | Things where I could get someone to help me or maybe find some cool automation to take                |
| 10:00      | care of it for me.                                                                                    |
| 10:01      | And when I track my time, I see exactly how much time those things take.                              |
| 10:05      | And that's just a big exclamation point for me to get that managed so I can spend my time             |
| 10:10      | doing what's truly important for me.                                                                  |
| 10:12      | And that's where timing comes in instead of making you start and stop timers.                         |
| 10:16      | Timing automatically tracks how much time you spend on each app, document and website.                |
| 10:22      | It shows you exactly when you were working on what and when you slacked off and how productive        |
| 10:27      | you've been.                                                                                          |
| 10:28      | So you know how much tool you can improve your productivity.                                          |
| 10:33      | Timing functionality is similar to iOS 12 screen time, but it's for the Mac and honestly              |
| 10:39      | it's much better because it's way more granular.                                                      |
| 10:42      | The manual tracking and adjustments are still possible with timing's automated approach,              |
| 10:46      | plus it has a gorgeous new dark mode.                                                                 |
| 10:48      | But you know, work doesn't just happen on your Mac.                                                   |
| 10:51      | That's why the timeline automatically makes suggestions for filling in the gaps for your              |
| 10:55      | timeline and that way you'll never again forget to enter a meeting and with the automatic             |
| 11:00      | sync feature, your track time will magically appear across all your Mac.                              |
| 11:05      | So even when you work on the go with your Mac book, you'll have a full picture of your                |
| 11:10      | app on your iMac since you get home.                                                                  |
| 11:12      | Like I said, I just really like the ability to find those areas of my life that need to               |
| 11:17      | get removed and time tracking is one of the best tools to identify it.                                |
| 11:23      | Timing the app is the way to do this because you don't have to push a button.                         |
| 11:28      | You know, manually tracking time just gets garbage data unless you're really, really                  |
| 11:33      | good at remembering to push that button.                                                              |

| 12:01      | Let's get started with these shortcuts updates because I don't know how long we've got left,          |
| 12:06      | but we haven't got long and we've got a lot to cover.                                                 |
| 12:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:10      | It's great.                                                                                           |
| 12:11      | Let's just start by saying it's great.                                                                |
| 12:12      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 12:13      | There is absolutely no way we are disappointed about any of this.                                     |
| 12:16      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 12:17      | I think I want to start talking about just the application user interface because there's             |
| 12:22      | been a lot of changes, but it's not for the bad.                                                      |
| 12:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:26      | So when Siri shortcuts first appeared on iOS last year, it looked a lot like workflow,                |
| 12:34      | but it looked like they took a dark, the dark mode of the original workflow and turned it             |
| 12:38      | into light mode in iOS, but largely, I mean, even the shapes of the boxes and the way it,             |
| 12:45      | you know, the general format of the application stayed the same.                                      |
| 12:49      | So it was very familiar if you had been coming from workflow.                                         |
| 12:53      | This year, it's still as familiar, but they have made some nice kind of, I would just                 |
| 12:58      | call it clean user interface improvements.                                                            |
| 13:00      | The colours got a little better and just the way it looks like they had a graphic design               |
| 13:04      | or come in and do a facelift.                                                                         |
| 13:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:07      | And so for example, if you look at your shortcuts library, and I'll try and include some screenshots  |
| 13:11      | of this, the colours for the Azure shortcuts are a little more muted.                                  |
| 13:15      | But if you think about it, because iOS has light and dark mode and it can automatically               |
| 13:19      | switch between light and dark mode at sunrise and sunset, then you can, you know, this doesn't        |
| 13:26      | glare in your face like the bright colours from shortcuts previously would.                            |
| 13:30      | And that's kind of just the start of it because they've tidied up all the icons and everything        |
| 13:34      | as well.                                                                                              |
| 13:35      | And the icons have got a more prominent role when, for example, all of your shortcuts                 |
| 13:40      | show up directly in the share sheet.                                                                  |
| 13:42      | So they're not hidden behind a shortcuts action anymore.                                              |
| 13:46      | They're just right there in your share sheet, right in your face, ready for you to use.               |
| 13:49      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 13:50      | And that can, that's great for discoverability.                                                       |
| 13:52      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 13:53      | And, you know, I was thinking about that a lot of people only have a few shortcuts.                   |
| 13:58      | So that's, that's just great.                                                                         |
| 14:00      | But for folks like you and me that have hundreds of them.                                             |
| 14:03      | We need to go through and clean up what our shortcuts can accept because I know a lot                 |
| 14:06      | of the time when I'm testing things, I just say, you can accept anything.                             |
| 14:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 14:11      | And I'm good to go.                                                                                   |
| 14:12      | And now I sort of look at my share sheet and go, whoops, I need to fix this.                          |
| 14:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 14:17      | So, so that's, that's cool.                                                                           |
| 14:18      | And, and honestly, you and I are edge cases.                                                          |
| 14:21      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 14:22      | In fact, one of the things that it didn't get this year that a lot of us nerds are like               |
| 14:28      | clamoring for is better organisation, like you, like folders.                                         |
| 14:32      | You don't have those now, but honestly, I don't think many people are the edge cases                  |
| 14:38      | like you, me, [[Matthew Cassinelli\|Matt Cassinelli]], [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]], the folks who have many, many, many shortcuts.               |
| 14:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 14:44      | Most of all have a few that work for me and they're sane as opposed to insane.                        |
| 14:48      | So I'm sure [[Apple]] saw those numbers.                                                                  |
| 14:50      | And if I was looking at the whiteboard and said, well, do I create folders for the super              |
| 14:54      | nerds or do I just make it more powerful for everyone?                                                |
| 14:57      | And I think they made the right decision.                                                             |
| 14:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 15:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 15:01      | It's one of these things.                                                                             |
| 15:02      | A lot of the decisions that they have to make, of course, they get the requests from                  |
| 15:04      | us heavy power users, but they have to keep in mind that it's not just the power users                |
| 15:10      | that they want to use the application.                                                                |
| 15:11      | They want to make things friendly.                                                                    |
| 15:13      | So, and that's something I found from talking to them this week, you know, they, they're              |
| 15:16      | really, their, their interest is making this accessible to everybody regardless of their              |
| 15:21      | level of knowledge about this stuff.                                                                  |
| 15:23      | And that's, I think, definitely the right decision for them to make.                                  |
| 15:26      | And along that lines, in addition to being a pretty face, you know, with this update,                 |
| 15:31      | they have now made shortcuts, a built in application on your iPad and iPhone.                         |
| 15:37      | So no longer do you have to go to the app store and download it, you just, it just shows              |
| 15:41      | up on your device when you do the upgrade to iOS 13.                                                  |
| 15:45      | That means everyone is going to have shortcuts.                                                       |
| 15:49      | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 15:50      | I, I'm still wrapping my head around that Rose.                                                       |
| 15:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 15:55      | It's, it's crazy.                                                                                     |
| 15:56      | She's got to have shortcuts installed on her two iPads on her iPhone.                                 |
| 15:58      | I mean, she's already in edge case having two iPads, but she's got to have shortcuts                  |
| 16:02      | installed on three devices.                                                                           |
| 16:03      | It's huge.                                                                                            |
| 16:04      | I was, I was thinking like, even like my wife who is kind of interested in this stuff,                |
| 16:08      | but not interested enough to go to the app store and download it.                                     |
| 16:12      | I think once it's on her device, she's just going to open it up anyway and, and you know,             |
| 16:17      | we'll see how she does with that.                                                                     |
| 16:18      | I'll help her out a little bit, but I do think there's going to be a bunch of new people              |
| 16:22      | interested in shortcuts because suddenly this colourful application is going to show up on             |
| 16:26      | their devices.                                                                                        |
| 16:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 16:28      | That can only be good for the future of shortcuts.                                                    |
| 16:31      | It is.                                                                                                |
| 16:32      | So they've also made some other changes inside of the application.                                    |
| 16:34      | So if you had the if before, you may remember this vertical line running through your shortcut,       |
| 16:41      | which sometimes was connected.                                                                        |
| 16:43      | Sometimes it wasn't connected.                                                                        |
| 16:44      | That line is still there.                                                                             |
| 16:45      | But the if action, for example, now explicitly has a little input bubble, which means that            |
| 16:51      | when you tap on that, so say for example, you, you've done something before, maybe you                |
| 16:56      | did a get contents of URL to get some records out of air table, you explicitly say if this            |
| 17:01      | record from air table, then you have your conditions and the conditions are dynamic                   |
| 17:07      | based on what kind of input it is, which is why it's, it's even better than it was before.            |
| 17:13      | So I'm just playing with a, an action for a Trello card right now and it's going, you                 |
| 17:17      | know, if it has any input, which is great, because, you know, if there's no input, then               |
| 17:23      | you don't want to be doing things probably.                                                           |
| 17:26      | So that's, that's good fun.                                                                           |
| 17:27      | It's just like they humanise the language of these programming components even more                   |
| 17:32      | this year.                                                                                            |
| 17:33      | Like there, I remember in the prior version, you can have like, if you have a variable,               |
| 17:40      | you can either input the variable as part of your shortcut, or you can put in to ask                  |
| 17:44      | when run.                                                                                             |
| 17:46      | But now they remove the term ask when run.                                                            |
| 17:49      | And they put something, I forget what it says now, Rose may be able to look it up.                    |
| 17:53      | She's got it installed on hers.                                                                       |
| 17:54      | But the, they made it just easier for normal people to understand what they're saying.                |
| 18:00      | And they removed kind of the programming slant to the language.                                       |
| 18:05      | The other thing that they did that's interesting is they, you're looking at me.                       |
| 18:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 18:10      | So they, it's called ask each time now, but this ties into conversational theory, which               |
| 18:15      | we're going to get to in a moment.                                                                    |
| 18:17      | So keep going, David.                                                                                 |
| 18:18      | And then the other thing they did is so often, and you would, in order to run a shortcut,             |
| 18:22      | you've got a couple things you need to do.                                                            |
| 18:24      | First you need to get information, then you need to pass that information to the next                 |
| 18:28      | step.                                                                                                 |
| 18:29      | And those were two steps.                                                                             |
| 18:30      | And for a lot of folks, you don't know, well, what kind of information, how do I get the              |
| 18:34      | information to pass along?                                                                            |
| 18:36      | And a lot of these new shortcuts from what I've seen is combined into one step.                       |
| 18:42      | So when you want to do something, it collects the information and processes or acts on it             |
| 18:47      | in the very same step.                                                                                |
| 18:49      | So people don't have to figure out how to connect those two things.                                   |
| 18:52      | It's just done for you now.                                                                           |
| 18:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 18:55      | Which is really useful.                                                                               |
| 18:56      | And also it's just, so it's set variable for is gone.                                                 |
| 19:02      | So some people are going to be going, oh my God, set variables gone.                                  |
| 19:04      | Don't worry.                                                                                          |
| 19:05      | There is a migration assistant, of course, because I'm me and I installed this on day                 |
| 19:09      | one.                                                                                                  |
| 19:10      | And my migration system didn't run and the shortcuts team have already looked at it.                  |
| 19:14      | And I'm pretty certain they're working on a fix and that will be done momentarily.                    |
| 19:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 19:18      | I say momentarily, probably, hopefully in the next iOS beta, because of course shortcuts              |
| 19:23      | is part of iOS now.                                                                                   |
| 19:24      | So it can update whenever iOS updates, including whenever there's a beta.                             |
| 19:28      | But you know, this is going to be easier for everybody because you just use magic variables           |
| 19:35      | now.                                                                                                  |
| 19:36      | You just use set variables and when you are doing an if something, then you know that                 |
| 19:41      | you have to select the right thing because this is something I see very frequently.                   |
| 19:46      | People try and do a set name on something, but they got the file earlier and they've                  |
| 19:50      | gone through and they picked a bunch of other things.                                                 |
| 19:53      | And so they're trying to set the name actually of a piece of text that's come out of a choose         |
| 19:56      | from list rather than the file.                                                                       |
| 19:58      | And if you look at the set name action right now, she says trying to pull it up in front              |
| 20:03      | of her.                                                                                               |
| 20:04      | Then you set the name of what something in particular.                                                |
| 20:08      | So it's giving me the option in this particular shortcut that I'm looking at.                         |
| 20:11      | There's text, there's Trello cards, and there's an if.                                                |
| 20:14      | But I can pick different ones, but it explicitly shows you which one it is so that you know           |
| 20:20      | what you're doing.                                                                                    |
| 20:22      | It's like magic variables to the next generation.                                                     |
| 20:26      | Yes, it is because they're built into every single action.                                            |
| 20:30      | And of course, with the condensed actions as well, so for example, the speak text action,             |
| 20:35      | you can set the language of the voice that should speak it.                                           |
| 20:39      | So you can, for example, have somebody with an Arabic accent speaking English or something            |
| 20:44      | like that.                                                                                            |
| 20:45      | These are of course computerised, so they're not hugely accurate.                                     |
| 20:48      | You can pick the different voices.                                                                    |
| 20:49      | You can say what until finished, the rate and the pitch.                                              |
| 20:52      | I've been having some great fun playing with that.                                                    |
| 20:54      | It tells me very excited, I'm going to Disney.                                                        |
| 20:58      | Very high voice.                                                                                      |
| 20:59      | Hilarious, because, you know, I went to Disney.                                                       |
| 21:03      | So yeah, it's much more user friendly, but it doesn't mean that it's not power user                   |
| 21:10      | friendly either, which is something that of course I'm sure some people have been worried             |
| 21:13      | about.                                                                                                |
| 21:14      | If we're making it more user friendly, what are we losing is power users, and the answer              |
| 21:19      | is nothing.                                                                                           |
| 21:20      | We're gaining so much.                                                                                |
| 21:21      | Yeah, from what I've seen, you've lost no functionality, but if anything, it's only                   |
| 21:24      | improved.                                                                                             |
| 21:25      | Yes, because there are so many new actions as well.                                                   |
| 21:28      | And it's more discoverable, so even new power users are going to find uses for actions that           |
| 21:33      | never occurred to you before, because it was up to us before to go through and set parameters         |
| 21:39      | and find them and just kind of come up with them in our head where now the application                |
| 21:44      | lays them out for you, everything it can do for every action.                                         |
| 21:47      | And it's just, you know, it's the obvious way it should have been done in hindsight.                  |
| 21:53      | As so often these things can be.                                                                      |
| 21:55      | When you see it, you mean like, like, yeah, okay, that makes sense.                                   |
| 21:58      | And I can see a lot of people who would have been intimidated by the old system, feeling              |
| 22:03      | more comfortable with this and people who understood the old system are going to appreciate           |
| 22:07      | this.                                                                                                 |
| 22:08      | It makes it easier in a lot of ways to build shortcuts.                                               |
| 22:10      | So I mean, it's just a win all the way around.                                                        |
| 22:13      | Now, you had said earlier that it's now as the fact that as a result of the fact that                 |
| 22:18      | shortcuts is now part of the operating system, we have got to deal with updates.                      |
| 22:23      | Now, I really liked, frankly, in that first year that we could get updates to serious                 |
| 22:28      | shortcuts independent of operating system updates, because [[Apple]] doesn't do that many                 |
| 22:33      | of those, you know, they'll do a couple point updates over the course of the year.                    |
| 22:36      | And then we have to wait, you know, every year for the big update.                                    |
| 22:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 22:40      | Well, we're on that schedule now.                                                                     |
| 22:41      | I mean, that is shortcuts is no longer going to be independent.                                       |
| 22:44      | But if at the same time, I went back and I did a little review of this, like, when did                |
| 22:49      | iOS update versus when did shortcuts update, and they only did two updates out of sync                |
| 22:54      | with iOS last year.                                                                                   |
| 22:56      | So but it was still the same number pretty much.                                                      |
| 22:59      | I think there was one very small bug fix that snuck in there somewhere.                               |
| 23:03      | So it's not like we're actually going to be losing something.                                         |
| 23:06      | We're not going to be going from 52 updates a year to five updates a year.                            |
| 23:10      | We're going from, you know, five updates a year to five updates a year at the same time               |
| 23:14      | as iOS, which is good, because this is very much integrated in the operating system.                  |
| 23:19      | So it'd be very disappointing for everybody if shortcuts released an update and then iOS              |
| 23:22      | came out three days later and was like, oh, yep, broke it all.                                        |
| 23:26      | You know, we don't we don't want that.                                                                |
| 23:27      | And the shortcuts team doesn't want that either.                                                      |
| 23:28      | The iOS team, I'm sure it doesn't want it.                                                            |
| 23:31      | So it's good that they're in lockstep.                                                                |
| 23:33      | One of the nice things is Rose and I have both been able to spend some time with the shortcuts        |
| 23:37      | team this week.                                                                                       |
| 23:38      | And a couple of things that I want to report.                                                         |
| 23:39      | First of all, we don't ask them much because I don't want them to get fired.                          |
| 23:43      | No, no, we want them to stay available working on this stuff because it's amazing.                    |
| 23:47      | An observation you can make is number one, there is a shortcuts team.                                 |
| 23:52      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 23:53      | Number two, it's quite large.                                                                         |
| 23:55      | It is.                                                                                                |
| 23:56      | And every person I met in it is pretty smart.                                                         |
| 23:59      | I mean, they they all seem like they, you know, their elevators go to floors higher                   |
| 24:03      | than mine does.                                                                                       |
| 24:05      | And that's good because you want those folks working on it and and they're all passionate             |
| 24:09      | about it.                                                                                             |
| 24:10      | So, you know, sometimes [[Apple]] makes products and they release it and they say, hey, this              |
| 24:14      | is the greatest thing in the world and then you don't see much from it for years.                     |
| 24:18      | We already saw in the first year shortcuts, isn't that product?                                       |
| 24:21      | They've already been updating it, but it looks to me like into the at least immediate future          |
| 24:26      | [[Apple]] continues to be funding and pressing this.                                                      |
| 24:30      | And I'm really happy to see that I'm that was one of the most encouraging things I saw                |
| 24:33      | today.                                                                                                |
| 24:34      | It's just the number of people that are working on shortcuts and how passionate they are about        |
| 24:38      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 24:39      | Yeah, they're so excited about this as well.                                                          |
| 24:40      | Like obviously, you know, everybody who works at [[Apple]] is disappointed when their product             |
| 24:44      | doesn't get keynote time, but these people were still so excited and so happy.                        |
| 24:48      | And you know, saying like, you know, have you seen this feature?                                      |
| 24:50      | Have you seen that feature?                                                                           |
| 24:52      | It's great.                                                                                           |
| 24:53      | Yeah, it's awesome.                                                                                   |
| 24:54      | And just great, nice people behind this.                                                              |
| 24:57      | I am very encouraged by that.                                                                         |
| 24:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 25:00      | And for the developers I've talked to who've been to the shortcuts labs as well, you know,            |
| 25:03      | they've been really, really helpful there.                                                            |
| 25:05      | Of course.                                                                                            |
| 25:06      | I mean, this is [[WWDC]], [[Apple|Apple's]] not there going, oh, no, no, no, we won't tell you how to do            |
| 25:10      | this.                                                                                                 |
| 25:11      | They're showing developers how to do everything, but you know, they're showing developers             |
| 25:14      | in the nicest way and being excited about it, which is great for everyone.                            |
| 25:18      | Okay, we're going to get in a few minutes, we're going to talk about just the on the                  |
| 25:21      | ground improvements to Siri shortcuts, how you can use it, making your scripts, and maybe             |
| 25:26      | before we do that, you want to talk a little bit about the developer angle of what's changed          |
| 25:30      | in Siri shortcuts.                                                                                    |
| 25:31      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 25:32      | So specifically, there are two big things that have changed.                                          |
| 25:37      | And I'm going to start with the smaller one, and then you're going to see how, how wide               |
| 25:41      | reaching that is with the second one.                                                                 |
| 25:43      | So the first one is conversational Siri.                                                              |
| 25:45      | And this, first of all, can I say, I love that this is the smaller one that just makes                |
| 25:50      | me laugh.                                                                                             |
| 25:51      | I know, because this is huge.                                                                         |
| 25:52      | So it is no longer that you just like you, you say, hello device, please run my shortcut              |
| 25:58      | called ABC.                                                                                           |
| 26:00      | It is that there is back and forth and Siri understands this and you don't have to build              |
| 26:05      | this with dictation and then transcribing dictation and picking things out and so on.                 |
| 26:10      | This is built in by the shortcuts team into shortcuts.                                                |
| 26:14      | So you can ask for input and send things in backwards and forwards with talking, which                |
| 26:20      | is amazing.                                                                                           |
| 26:22      | And the way that you're going to see how far reaching this is, is we also now have parameterised      |
| 26:27      | donated shortcuts, which means that for example, all of these shortcuts that were built into          |
| 26:33      | the system before, and I'm going to use the only focus one as a great example, the adding             |
| 26:37      | a task to OmniFocus, that was created by the shortcuts team.                                          |
| 26:41      | So you had your task name, you had your project name and things like that, which meant that           |
| 26:45      | whenever OmniFocus updated, they had to file a radar with [[Apple]] or whatever it is that                |
| 26:50      | they had to do.                                                                                       |
| 26:51      | And they had to wait for the shortcuts team to update this.                                           |
| 26:54      | Now there are billions of apps on the app store.                                                      |
| 26:57      | So this is not maintainable.                                                                          |
| 26:59      | This is not something that you can keep doing long term.                                              |
| 27:02      | So they've now done this so that any developer for any application can donate an action like          |
| 27:08      | that, which provides output.                                                                          |
| 27:12      | And I just saw that on a keynote slide and melted into a little ball of excitement.                   |
| 27:18      | I think there's a little video of me somewhere going, yee, because I was so excited because           |
| 27:22      | we're obviously that a lot of developers were doing dances with clipboard.                            |
| 27:25      | So they would get the clipboard set the clipboard, which meant the shortcuts for us were looked       |
| 27:30      | pretty unwieldy because it was just a massive clipboard.                                              |
| 27:33      | And then at the end, you've got some dictionaries from carrot weather on your clipboard, rather       |
| 27:37      | than whatever it is you have before.                                                                  |
| 27:39      | Well, they don't need to do that anymore.                                                             |
| 27:41      | And this is just this combined with conversational Siri.                                              |
| 27:44      | So Siri can ask me, okay, what do you want your task to be called?                                    |
| 27:47      | What project do you want to add this to?                                                              |
| 27:49      | And it's just amazing.                                                                                |
| 27:51      | So wide reaching.                                                                                     |
| 27:52      | Yeah, I feel like the result of this is we're going to see a ton of new actions in the                |
| 27:58      | Siri shortcuts for those of us that like to build shortcuts.                                          |
| 28:01      | Our favourite app developers and the ones that are kind of woke on this are going to be adding         |
| 28:06      | a ton of custom actions to their applications.                                                        |
| 28:11      | So you're going to be able to do more with automation with these applications than ever               |
| 28:14      | before because the tools already built for you.                                                       |
| 28:17      | You don't have to figure out some way to, you know, jury rig it together.                             |
| 28:21      | It's just done.                                                                                       |
| 28:22      | Like the OmniFocus is a good example.                                                                 |
| 28:24      | I am sure there's probably right now at the Omni Group, a group of folks that work on OmniFocus        |
| 28:30      | figuring out, okay, now we've got the ability to create our own actions.                              |
| 28:34      | In addition to that one that we had, let's add six more.                                              |
| 28:37      | What are the six things?                                                                              |
| 28:38      | So let's add once great projects and folders and things like that and perspectives even               |
| 28:43      | is a possibility.                                                                                     |
| 28:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:45      | Review.                                                                                               |
| 28:46      | I mean, just the whole thing.                                                                         |
| 28:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:48      | I was talking to a developer last night and one of the nice things about being at WWCs,               |
| 28:49      | there's so many developers here that you get to talk to about this stuff and he's writing             |
| 28:53      | an app for a company that it's like Airbnb for RVs, you know, and he's like, he's already             |
| 28:59      | got Siri Shortcuts ideas where he wants it to be where a renter can automatically get                 |
| 29:08      | a frequently asked questions for the device there, you know, for the RV they're renting               |
| 29:11      | and then he wants to combine that with NFC, which we're going to talk about in a minute.              |
| 29:15      | And it's like, there's all these things you can do together now.                                      |
| 29:18      | That's like the our tinker toy bucket just got a bunch of new pieces dumped in it.                    |
| 29:25      | So we're going to have a lot of fun figuring out how to connect all this stuff.                       |
| 29:29      | And the, I guess the net result of what Rose just explained to you is that we're not done             |
| 29:34      | filling the bucket with new toys because now the app developers can start throwing toys               |
| 29:39      | in there too.                                                                                         |
| 29:40      | So I expect that we're going to have a massive influx of new actions and Siri Shortcuts for           |
| 29:46      | the apps you download.                                                                                |
| 29:47      | And it's not going to like flood your app or flood your Siri Shortcuts, it's just going               |
| 29:51      | to relate to the apps that you download.                                                              |
| 29:53      | And it's going to be awesome.                                                                         |
| 29:55      | It is.                                                                                                |
| 29:56      | So we've got content scheduled for the next five years now, thanks for this.                          |
| 29:59      | There's going to be a lot to cover because, you know, it's going to be very app specific              |
| 30:04      | some stuff.                                                                                           |
| 30:05      | And, and you app developers listening, I know you're out there.                                       |
| 30:08      | If you guys make really amazing Siri Shortcuts stuff, let us know.                                    |
| 30:11      | We want to help spread the word, but, but, you know, we want you to do it too.                        |
| 30:15      | I feel like that's going to become a selling point for apps even more than it was before              |
| 30:19      | when they get better automation support because Siri Shortcuts is now on every device.                |
| 30:24      | If you can simplify automation for your users, there's going to be a lot of people interested         |
| 30:28      | in that.                                                                                              |
| 30:29      | Oh yeah, definitely.                                                                                  |
| 30:30      | So that was the little announcement.                                                                  |
| 30:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 30:32      | So that's the small stuff.                                                                            |
| 30:34      | Let's get to the big stuff now.                                                                       |
| 30:36      | So there's a new tab in the Shortcuts app called Automations.                                         |
| 30:42      | And this is the one I've just been wallowing in this going, yay, every single time I play             |
| 30:46      | with one of these because there are so many automations.                                              |
| 30:50      | Now to start with, if you, once you finally get this, and I'm going to say this a few                 |
| 30:55      | times, if you are not a developer, please do not install the developer beta.                          |
| 31:00      | It is buggy.                                                                                          |
| 31:01      | My iPad keeps crashing.                                                                               |
| 31:02      | I get notifications.                                                                                  |
| 31:03      | I tap on it.                                                                                          |
| 31:04      | It's springboards or it just locks up for a while.                                                    |
| 31:06      | This is not good.                                                                                     |
| 31:07      | And I'm using this to record a podcast on.                                                            |
| 31:08      | So David keeps giving me looks every now and then because it's like, wait, is your iPad               |
| 31:12      | broken again?                                                                                         |
| 31:13      | I also have my iPhone right with me.                                                                  |
| 31:16      | But inside the Automation tab, you have all of your home kit automations as well.                     |
| 31:23      | So everything that was in a home, still in home, but it's been imported because there                 |
| 31:28      | are two kinds of automations that you can create.                                                     |
| 31:30      | You can create a personal automation or a home automation.                                            |
| 31:33      | And home automations are shared with people who you share your home with.                             |
| 31:38      | Personal automations are for you.                                                                     |
| 31:39      | So they're on all of your devices, but they're just on your devices.                                  |
| 31:42      | And this ties in with the HomePod.                                                                    |
| 31:44      | So it means that if you talk to the HomePod and say, hey, you know, and run my good morning           |
| 31:49      | shortcut, it will run your good morning shortcut.                                                     |
| 31:53      | But if your partner talks to the HomePod and asks it to run their good morning shortcut,              |
| 31:57      | it runs their good morning shortcut and talks to their calendars.                                     |
| 32:00      | And this is huge.                                                                                     |
| 32:03      | I finally get that thing I want, Rose, where as I walk in the front door, the opening Star            |
| 32:10      | Wars theme just starts blasting throughout my house.                                                  |
| 32:13      | Because it can do stuff when you arrive at places now.                                                |
| 32:16      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 32:17      | My wife is going to go crazy.                                                                         |
| 32:18      | She's going to be so mad.                                                                             |
| 32:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 32:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 32:22      | Well, the good news is the Shooter Wars is you have got a really comfy sofa that you                  |
| 32:24      | can car.                                                                                              |
| 32:25      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 32:26      | And man, we're going to have so much fun with this stuff and I'm teasing stuff.                       |
| 32:31      | So one of the things you can do with this automation is they've added a whole bunch                   |
| 32:35      | of triggers.                                                                                          |
| 32:36      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 32:37      | So it's funny because just weeks ago I was finishing up the [[Keyboard Maestro]] Field Guide              |
| 32:42      | and [[Keyboard Maestro]] has, it's a Mac-based application, it's got an amazing number of                 |
| 32:49      | triggers in it where you can start automations, not only by pushing a button, but by automatically    |
| 32:55      | having things happen.                                                                                 |
| 32:57      | And I was thinking at the time, I'm like, man, wouldn't it be nice if we had these things             |
| 33:01      | in [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]]?                                                                                  |
| 33:02      | And as the thought occurred to me, I immediately dismissed it.                                        |
| 33:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:07      | This isn't going to happen for years.                                                                 |
| 33:10      | I mean, we're never, if ever, right?                                                                  |
| 33:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 33:14      | And the cool thing about this is because historically [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] have been amazing, but they've |
| 33:18      | required you to open an app and push a button or do you have to do something on your phone            |
| 33:23      | to make it happen?                                                                                    |
| 33:25      | And that's not true automation.                                                                       |
| 33:27      | Well, guess what?                                                                                     |
| 33:29      | We got it.                                                                                            |
| 33:30      | And I thought, okay, well, if they give us automatic triggers for your shortcuts, they're             |
| 33:37      | just going to give us the most basic, like it'll be like on Tuesday at 2pm, like time                 |
| 33:41      | of day, you know, and they did that one, but they didn't stop there, did they?                        |
| 33:46      | No, no.                                                                                               |
| 33:47      | The shortcuts team, I get the impression that they got very excited with the possibilities            |
| 33:51      | and they just went with it and they did all of them.                                                  |
| 33:54      | So you can have on Tuesday at 2pm, but you can also have sunrise and sunset, just like                |
| 34:00      | it's been imported from the home application, but you can also have like an alarm.                    |
| 34:05      | So when an existing alarm or your wake-up alarm gets snoozed or when it gets stopped.                 |
| 34:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:11      | So just think about this.                                                                             |
| 34:13      | You could have, if you're having trouble waking up, when you hit your snooze button, it starts        |
| 34:18      | playing a song through your HomePod.                                                                 |
| 34:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:21      | Or you could buy one of these, these vibration alarms and whenever you hit the snooze button,         |
| 34:27      | you could just like vibrate that, turn that on with whether it's smart plugs or something.            |
| 34:31      | And so you get like a little jolting around in bed.                                                   |
| 34:33      | I'm not suggesting you do like electric shocks or anything that seems a little extreme, but           |
| 34:38      | you could do so many things.                                                                          |
| 34:39      | I once saw a really cool alarm clock that had a propeller on it.                                      |
| 34:42      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 34:43      | So you have to run and find it.                                                                       |
| 34:44      | And it would like take off.                                                                           |
| 34:45      | Just shut it up.                                                                                      |
| 34:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:48      | Those are smart.                                                                                      |
| 34:49      | I was thinking about a game for my kids, but I realised they're probably just going to                |
| 34:50      | throw the alarm clock through the window.                                                             |
| 34:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:53      | Before they find the propeller.                                                                       |
| 34:54      | Yeah, and I think, I don't know, but I think I'm quite unlikely to throw my HomePod out              |
| 34:59      | the window.                                                                                           |
| 35:00      | I'm fairly attached to it.                                                                            |
| 35:01      | And it's heavy too.                                                                                   |
| 35:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:03      | And you're tired.                                                                                     |
| 35:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:05      | And also the power cord doesn't just like come out, which means that you need to unplug               |
| 35:07      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 35:08      | But this is really cool when you start thinking all those automations, you can start automatically    |
| 35:13      | tying to nighttime and bedtime routines.                                                              |
| 35:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:17      | I love that.                                                                                          |
| 35:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:19      | And you can also do it based on location as well.                                                     |
| 35:21      | So like when I get somewhere, when I leave somewhere, but you can also do like when I                 |
| 35:26      | get somewhere within a time range.                                                                    |
| 35:28      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 35:29      | So when I get to work between eight and 10, Monday to Friday, then do this.                           |
| 35:34      | But if I just go past on Saturday and don't bother, which is so good.                                 |
| 35:38      | Or even every time you leave work, send a text message to your significant other saying,              |
| 35:44      | hey, I just left work.                                                                                |
| 35:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:46      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 35:47      | And we've always had something similar to that, but you always had to push the button.                |
| 35:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 35:52      | Where in this case, now that this is automatically triggered by you leaving a location, this          |
| 35:57      | just happens.                                                                                         |
| 35:58      | You don't even think about it.                                                                        |
| 35:59      | That's, that's the automation that gets me excited.                                                   |
| 36:02      | And I should add a little caveat to this and it is a reasonable caveat.                               |
| 36:07      | I feel that I should say in that if your shortcut does not require input, it can run entirely         |
| 36:13      | in the background.                                                                                    |
| 36:15      | Dude, you don't need to do anything.                                                                  |
| 36:17      | So you just walk out of work, you get on your public transport or get in your car or whatever         |
| 36:21      | and you drive home.                                                                                   |
| 36:22      | And as you get home, because you got there, the, the garage door opens or whatever it                 |
| 36:25      | is that you set up and you walk into your house and then it starts playing the Star                   |
| 36:29      | Wars theme.                                                                                           |
| 36:30      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 36:31      | And if you don't need to select what song it is or input the text that you're sending                 |
| 36:36      | to your partner and things like that, it will just do it.                                             |
| 36:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:40      | It's finally like internal to the operating system.                                                   |
| 36:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:43      | And you can also connect this to before I leave.                                                      |
| 36:48      | So this is using the Siri predictions.                                                                |
| 36:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:51      | So, you know, sometimes it pops up and it's like, oh, hey, like, you know, like if you                |
| 36:55      | better leave for work so that you get there on time, but you don't actually have work                 |
| 36:58      | in your calendar.                                                                                     |
| 36:59      | Siri just knows that you go to work at about the same time every day.                                 |
| 37:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:03      | Well, you can hook into that.                                                                         |
| 37:04      | And you can do stuff at the predicted time, five minutes before 10, 15, 30, 16 minutes                |
| 37:10      | before and the options that it's showing me here is predict when I will leave for home                |
| 37:16      | and for work.                                                                                         |
| 37:17      | I don't know if it's got any more than those for other people.                                        |
| 37:20      | I'm guessing I'm a very boring person and I kind of go to two places and that's it.                   |
| 37:24      | I think it's really just any event base.                                                              |
| 37:26      | I mean, I don't think it's going to matter.                                                           |
| 37:28      | And just, I was just thinking, well, you know, maybe like I always brush my teeth before              |
| 37:33      | I leave the house, you know, and so I could set up the brush teeth timer.                             |
| 37:38      | But I mean, it's like you could do a whole bunch of stuff.                                            |
| 37:41      | Rose is like, I've got, I've got a look that I'm giving David right now.                              |
| 37:44      | I've never seen that look before.                                                                     |
| 37:46      | It's very excited look because you know that there are some toothbrushes that are Bluetooth           |
| 37:50      | connected, right?                                                                                     |
| 37:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:52      | Well, you can also trigger a shortcut when a Bluetooth device connects to your device.                |
| 37:58      | Oh my goodness.                                                                                       |
| 37:59      | So when your Bluetooth toothbrush connects to your iPhone, it can just start the timer                |
| 38:05      | for you.                                                                                              |
| 38:06      | I mean, of course, most of the, if it's a Bluetooth connected toothbrush, it's probably               |
| 38:08      | got that.                                                                                             |
| 38:09      | But maybe it starts playing the news on your HomePod and like reading out the headlines              |
| 38:12      | of the day.                                                                                           |
| 38:13      | Oh, your toothbrushing song.                                                                          |
| 38:14      | I know.                                                                                               |
| 38:15      | What would your toothbrushing song be, Rose?                                                          |
| 38:16      | Oh gosh.                                                                                              |
| 38:17      | That is a good question.                                                                              |
| 38:18      | Can I take a rain check on that?                                                                      |
| 38:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:21      | I think mine would be some kind of like rock ability, something, something like with a                |
| 38:24      | good rhythm.                                                                                          |
| 38:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:27      | It's got to have a good rhythm.                                                                       |
| 38:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:29      | Definitely.                                                                                           |
| 38:30      | So yeah.                                                                                              |
| 38:31      | So I mentioned Bluetooth devices.                                                                     |
| 38:32      | When a Bluetooth device connects to your iOS device, you can trigger something.                       |
| 38:35      | So for example, if I connect these headphones, start playing my podcast playlist in overcast.         |
| 38:39      | But if I connect those headphones and start playing my work playlist, but if I connect                |
| 38:44      | the other headphones and start playing this music playlist or whatever, this is so good.              |
| 38:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:51      | The whole Bluetooth connection thing runs really deep.                                                |
| 38:55      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 38:56      | You can.                                                                                              |
| 38:57      | We haven't, should we talk about this, Rose?                                                          |
| 39:00      | I think we should.                                                                                    |
| 39:01      | I think we should.                                                                                    |
| 39:02      | We should do some folks that know things and apparently, so now with iOS, you can now connect         |
| 39:07      | a mouse through accessibility and if the mouse has buttons on it, those buttons are registered        |
| 39:14      | under accessibility, but also addressable in Siri shortcuts.                                          |
| 39:18      | So then we started talking with folks that know things about, well, what if you bought                |
| 39:22      | one of those little Bluetooth like gaming keypads where it's got like 30 buttons on                   |
| 39:27      | it and, and we haven't tested this yet.                                                               |
| 39:31      | We're still on the ground.                                                                            |
| 39:32      | Well, yes, because my, my, I didn't, I really didn't think that the assistive touch for               |
| 39:37      | pointing devices was going to happen.                                                                 |
| 39:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 39:40      | So I left my mice and trackpad and everything at home, which means that I've had no way to            |
| 39:43      | test this, but the, the, the things that I have seen and reports that I've heard from                 |
| 39:51      | other people who have tested this is that if you like mice and you happen to have a mouse             |
| 39:57      | with a lot of buttons, you can use those buttons to trigger shortcuts, but maybe you can even         |
| 40:02      | use anything with buttons that connects via Bluetooth.                                                |
| 40:05      | I'm not sure about that because it is specifically like mice that have the accessibility things.      |
| 40:12      | We'll have to figure it out.                                                                          |
| 40:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:14      | This is something we're going to have to test.                                                        |
| 40:15      | And of course, this is beta one right now.                                                            |
| 40:17      | We're literally recording this four days after the keynote one day before this episode                |
| 40:20      | releases, which is the Friday after the keynote was on the Monday and, and I'm just a little          |
| 40:24      | giddy right now.                                                                                      |
| 40:25      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 40:26      | I want to, I want this to go farther.                                                                 |
| 40:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:30      | So anyway, but that's just, you know, in addition to Bluetooth, you can trigger shortcuts based       |
| 40:36      | on connecting to Carplay or disconnecting.                                                            |
| 40:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:39      | And Wi-Fi as well.                                                                                    |
| 40:41      | So for example, if I get to my parents place and I connected their Wi-Fi, then I can actually         |
| 40:45      | have it go, Hey, you got all these things that you wanted to do when you visit your parents.          |
| 40:50      | Or when you enable or disable, do not disturb or low power mode and an airplane mode of               |
| 40:58      | course is part of that.                                                                               |
| 41:00      | But there's a couple of other ones, which it took me a moment to wrap my head around                  |
| 41:05      | the possibilities here.                                                                               |
| 41:07      | So we have NFC tags.                                                                                  |
| 41:08      | Now some of you have probably played with NFC tags on iOS before, but NFC tags can immediately        |
| 41:14      | run a specific shortcut.                                                                              |
| 41:15      | That's just it.                                                                                       |
| 41:16      | You tap it and it does it.                                                                            |
| 41:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 41:18      | NFC tags.                                                                                             |
| 41:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 41:21      | And it uses from what I understand from reading through the documentation.                            |
| 41:25      | I will note, I did read this very quickly.                                                            |
| 41:28      | It would use the unique ID of the NFC tag to figure this out.                                         |
| 41:31      | Which would make sense.                                                                               |
| 41:32      | It would.                                                                                             |
| 41:33      | So you walk in the front door, you tap your phone against the wall where you get a sticker            |
| 41:39      | and things just happen.                                                                               |
| 41:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 41:41      | Which is cool.                                                                                        |
| 41:42      | You go in your car.                                                                                   |
| 41:43      | I mean, we talked about this in relation to.                                                          |
| 41:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 41:49      | Launch Center Pro.                                                                                    |
| 41:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 41:51      | Recently.                                                                                             |
| 41:52      | But I mean, just like now we're adding all, not just Launch Center Pro, but the power of              |
| 41:55      | all shortcuts.                                                                                        |
| 41:56      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 41:57      | You know, and all the built-in automation.                                                            |
| 41:58      | And it runs entirely in the background, which is massive.                                             |
| 42:01      | I mean, if you sit at your desk, you put a sticker on your desk and you can tap your                  |
| 42:05      | phone or your iPad there and you can trigger all your automation.                                     |
| 42:09      | It's, I'm giddy just thinking about what I could do with this.                                        |
| 42:14      | And also, I'm thinking about the other people in my life because I could write scripts for            |
| 42:19      | my wife's phone that are different than mine.                                                         |
| 42:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 42:23      | I mean, she's not necessarily going to figure all this stuff out, but she would love to               |
| 42:26      | be able to walk in the front door and also hit that tag with her phone and have her things            |
| 42:31      | happen automatically.                                                                                 |
| 42:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 42:33      | And.                                                                                                  |
| 42:34      | There is one thing that I should note with this.                                                      |
| 42:36      | Of course, I can have an NFC tag program to do my thing, but when you tap that NFC tag,               |
| 42:41      | you're going to have to program that yourself.                                                        |
| 42:42      | And this is a security feature, so I can't program an NFC tag that's going to download,               |
| 42:47      | say a shortcut from the cloud, it's going to grab all of your contact data, it's going                |
| 42:51      | to zip it up, save it to my [[Dropbox]], it's going to go through, find your most frequently              |
| 42:55      | visited locations.                                                                                    |
| 42:56      | None of that is possible because, I mean, iOS is iOS.                                                 |
| 43:02      | It's a fairly locked down operating system.                                                           |
| 43:04      | They have opened it up massively, but they've not opened it up so wide that we get security           |
| 43:08      | issues where I create, I've got an NFC tag and David accidentally puts his phone on the               |
| 43:13      | table and boom, I've got all this information.                                                        |
| 43:16      | That is not possible.                                                                                 |
| 43:17      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 43:18      | It's an on-device.                                                                                    |
| 43:19      | But the benefit of this is if you're in a family and there's multiple people, each person's           |
| 43:25      | phone is going to see that NFC tag and do something different with it or nothing with                 |
| 43:29      | it, whether or not you've programmed it.                                                              |
| 43:32      | So you don't have to have four tags for four people, you can have one tag and each person             |
| 43:37      | tapping it is going to get different.                                                                 |
| 43:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:40      | You just have to set it up on each person's device and don't forget, NFC tags, that is                |
| 43:44      | iPhone only.                                                                                          |
| 43:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:46      | So there's one big one that we didn't get to yet.                                                     |
| 43:48      | Are you ready for it?                                                                                 |
| 43:49      | I'm ready.                                                                                            |
| 43:50      | When you open an app, now this is the one, it took me a while to wrap my head around.                 |
| 43:55      | I was thinking, what am I going to want to do every time I open an app?                               |
| 43:59      | And then I was there talking to a lovely person.                                                      |
| 44:03      | His name is Joe.                                                                                      |
| 44:04      | You may have heard of Joe.                                                                            |
| 44:06      | Joe created an app called Timery, a toggle timer.                                                     |
| 44:10      | And then I realised, this is what this is made for.                                                   |
| 44:14      | This is made for Joe.                                                                                 |
| 44:16      | I'm pretty much, I'm thinking of this as the Joe feature.                                             |
| 44:18      | I'm sure there are many, many other implementations.                                                  |
| 44:21      | But for example, when I open this application, start my timer for that.                               |
| 44:26      | So when I open Quip, start my automators timer, just do it.                                          |
| 44:30      | And that is where I just melted into a very excited ball of happiness.                                |
| 44:35      | Can you run these as well when you close an app?                                                      |
| 44:39      | It does not offer the option of when you close an app.                                                |
| 44:43      | So you can do things, there's some little bugs.                                                       |
| 44:46      | I'm seeing a lot of things in this app list that I should not be seeing.                              |
| 44:50      | But you can run things when you open specific applications, or you can run things when you            |
| 44:54      | open any application.                                                                                 |
| 44:55      | So you could potentially have a shortcut for any application that stops your timer, and               |
| 45:01      | then have shortcuts for specific applications that start specific timers.                             |
| 45:05      | It's just, all of this stuff is amazing.                                                              |
| 45:08      | We just glanced over Wi-Fi as a trigger.                                                              |
| 45:12      | But even when I was doing the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide, that is one of my very favourite            |
| 45:16      | triggers because it's so useful.                                                                      |
| 45:18      | Everybody goes to different places where they connect to Wi-Fi.                                       |
| 45:22      | Work versus home is a great example.                                                                  |
| 45:25      | And you just connect to the work Wi-Fi and suddenly maybe it closes out all your personal             |
| 45:30      | stuff.                                                                                                |
| 45:31      | I mean, it's tough to wrap my imagination around all the things I want to do with this                |
| 45:39      | as this gets out.                                                                                     |
| 45:40      | So we got some real fun ahead of us with Siri Shortcuts.                                              |
| 45:45      | I want to talk a little bit about conversational Siri because this is another thing that everybody    |
| 45:51      | wanted myself included.                                                                               |
| 45:52      | I want to be able to pass variables to Siri, and now you can.                                         |
| 45:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 45:58      | It is very exciting.                                                                                  |
| 45:59      | But before that, I think we should thank our second sponsor for the day.                              |

| 46:59      | Our thanks to PDF-Pen 11 for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                          |
| 47:04      | You know, passing variables to Siri.                                                                  |
| 47:07      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 47:08      | That's something we've always wanted, right?                                                          |
| 47:10      | It is.                                                                                                |
| 47:11      | And, you know, we could work around this a little last time, but it was a lot of work                 |
| 47:14      | to work around it, because you had to do the listen for dictation, then you had to do                 |
| 47:19      | probably regular expressions to try and match whether or not somebody said left or right.             |
| 47:23      | I mean, you could just try and do if it contained, but that didn't always work.                       |
| 47:28      | It was inconsistent and difficult.                                                                    |
| 47:30      | And now, Shortcuts is built to do all of this for us.                                                 |
| 47:36      | And I feel that I should mention [[Adam Tow\|Adam]], because we both met Adam this week.                            |
| 47:40      | Adam is the person behind Prompt Kit, Crown iOS, lots of these very long shortcuts that               |
| 47:48      | are great utilities.                                                                                  |
| 47:49      | So you can do things like watch notes and things like that or reminders for things.                   |
| 47:55      | And Adam's stuff is still excellent.                                                                  |
| 47:57      | If you haven't checked it out, he's got lots of it in our forums.                                     |
| 48:00      | I would highly recommend going in and looking for all of this, because it is amazing.                 |
| 48:05      | And also, if you're not a developer, please don't install the beta yet.                               |
| 48:09      | Wait for public beta, at least one.                                                                   |
| 48:12      | But conversational Siri, in some ways, eliminates the need for this, because also it can be           |
| 48:19      | very easily used by app developers.                                                                   |
| 48:22      | My concern always with requiring another shortcut to do the thing that you're doing is if somebody    |
| 48:27      | downloads one shortcut, then they've got one piece of the puzzle.                                     |
| 48:30      | But they're missing the other six or seven pieces, which is a little sad for those people.            |
| 48:35      | No, it's great.                                                                                       |
| 48:36      | I mean, it just opens up the world, again, with things you can do with Siri Shortcuts,                |
| 48:43      | because everything was one dimensional before.                                                        |
| 48:47      | It was the Siri Shortcut you ran had a beginning and an ending, and that was it.                      |
| 48:52      | You couldn't change tracks with the train.                                                            |
| 48:55      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 48:56      | I'm going to just screw this up, but I keep talking about analogies.                                  |
| 48:59      | But we've opened it up much wider now, so we can do a lot more than we used to be able                |
| 49:05      | to by being able to pass data back and forth with Siri.                                               |
| 49:11      | It can ask for input.                                                                                 |
| 49:12      | You can now talk to it.                                                                               |
| 49:14      | Let's just go on to ask for input for a moment.                                                       |
| 49:16      | So this was on my personal wish list.                                                                 |
| 49:18      | The ask for input would just, if you run it through Siri, let you talk to it.                         |
| 49:23      | And it does.                                                                                          |
| 49:25      | And that means that you don't have to rewrite all of your shortcuts.                                  |
| 49:28      | So if you just run it in the Shortcuts app, you can type, type, type as you would.                    |
| 49:32      | But if you run it through Siri, you can talk to it, and that is great.                                |
| 49:36      | One of the things I'm really looking forward to is once things get a little further along             |
| 49:40      | in the beta process, seeing if it improves on my HomePod.                                             |
| 49:44      | That is something that I've struggled with, honestly, in the first years that the HomePod,            |
| 49:50      | although it will accept Siri for me every time I ask it to do something with Siri, it                 |
| 49:55      | will start playing music, or it just doesn't seem to compute that I want it to do a Siri              |
| 50:00      | shortcut.                                                                                             |
| 50:01      | It's not, it does once in a while, but it's not nearly enough of a hit rate to make it                |
| 50:06      | consistent or something I can rely on.                                                                |
| 50:08      | Yeah, which is unfortunate, but I think we're going to get there with this.                           |
| 50:12      | I mean, when you can do this type of thing, I would assume that it probably is better,                |
| 50:18      | because that's the only way you can make it work.                                                     |
| 50:20      | Definitely.                                                                                           |
| 50:21      | So a lot of stuff we've been talking about, structure, all these triggers, I think, are               |
| 50:25      | just key.                                                                                             |
| 50:27      | We also got some new actions.                                                                         |
| 50:28      | Yeah, and I've just put a couple of my favourite ones in the show document, because we say             |
| 50:32      | here, talking about all of the new actions, and then we talk about all the ones that people           |
| 50:36      | like Culture Code and Omni Group and so on are going to add, like, we're going to be                  |
| 50:40      | here for the rest of our lives, but two ones that, for me, are very nice.                             |
| 50:46      | Set wallpaper.                                                                                        |
| 50:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 50:48      | So at 9 a.m. every day, you can have it grab the latest NASA image or whatever it is and              |
| 50:52      | set your wallpaper to that.                                                                           |
| 50:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 50:54      | Or at sunset every day, you could have it set your wallpaper to a dark wallpaper and                  |
| 50:57      | it summarised to a light wallpaper.                                                                   |
| 50:59      | Or if you work with a bunch of bozos that are, like, really serious and they don't want your          |
| 51:03      | personal stuff, you get to work, you connect to your Wi-Fi, you set your work wallpaper,              |
| 51:09      | you leave your work Wi-Fi, then you put your family back on the screen.                               |
| 51:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 51:13      | You know, it's like, it's just like whatever your needs are, now you can do that.                     |
| 51:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 51:17      | And the other one, which I love, love, love, love, love, love, set playback destination.              |
| 51:22      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 51:23      | Can we have a little round of applause for set playback destination?                                  |
| 51:25      | Oh, man, I wanted this one so bad.                                                                    |
| 51:27      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 51:28      | So now you can, like, grab music or can you use some of the new podcast actions that                  |
| 51:32      | have been added for the native podcast app?                                                           |
| 51:35      | And you can grab that and you can say play it on HomePod number four, because if you                  |
| 51:39      | have HomePods, they breed, like triples.                                                              |
| 51:40      | We remember this, right?                                                                              |
| 51:42      | You've been to my house, Rose.                                                                        |
| 51:43      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 51:44      | There are HomePods.                                                                                   |
| 51:45      | There are HomePods.                                                                                   |
| 51:46      | Lots of HomePods.                                                                                     |
| 51:47      | I like the HomePods.                                                                                  |
| 51:48      | There's now, I now have two downstairs.                                                               |
| 51:49      | A matched pair, which will be perfect to play my theme song as I walk through the front               |
| 51:53      | door.                                                                                                 |
| 51:54      | Though you may need an extra one next to the front door, just for security purposes, right?           |
| 51:59      | Next year.                                                                                            |
| 52:00      | Next year.                                                                                            |
| 52:01      | I think that might have to happen.                                                                    |
| 52:02      | But, you know, it's cool because before you would want to create shortcuts to play music,             |
| 52:08      | like for me, it's in my office.                                                                       |
| 52:09      | I'm in my office all day.                                                                             |
| 52:11      | I want to play music to the HomePod.                                                                  |
| 52:13      | And so it's not easy.                                                                                 |
| 52:15      | You had to do automation outside of the, well, it wasn't even automation.                             |
| 52:20      | You just had to manually set the location in addition to your automation.                             |
| 52:24      | But now you can just do it.                                                                           |
| 52:25      | Yep.                                                                                                  |
| 52:26      | And it's awesome.                                                                                     |
| 52:29      | And I mean, I'm sure there are lots of people listening.                                              |
| 52:32      | They really want to play with this.                                                                   |
| 52:33      | [[Apple]] does say it on the developer website.                                                           |
| 52:35      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 52:36      | Do not download this for thrill seekers.                                                              |
| 52:39      | Please wait till public beta one.                                                                     |
| 52:41      | I broke that rule and installed it on one device, but I'm very happy it's only on one                 |
| 52:45      | device because it's buggy.                                                                            |
| 52:47      | Basis are not kind to battery life.                                                                   |
| 52:48      | They will cause weird issues.                                                                         |
| 52:50      | I'm seeing in lots of applications, the text is so tiny.                                              |
| 52:53      | I literally have to touch the screen with my nose to be able to read it.                              |
| 52:57      | And I've tried changing, you know, like sizes of text and things like that.                           |
| 53:00      | And it's an iOS bug and it will be fixed, but it's not fixed yet.                                     |
| 53:04      | So don't install the developer beta unless you have a very, very, very good reason to                 |
| 53:09      | wait for the public beta.                                                                             |
| 53:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:11      | I played with roses and some other friends that have also installed it.                               |
| 53:14      | And it looks like this one has a lot of pain and suffering installed involved.                        |
| 53:19      | In fact, it's interesting.                                                                            |
| 53:21      | This is the first time in years that [[Apple|Apple's]] made it to put the beta on your iPhone or iPad.          |
| 53:26      | You literally have to download the restore image.                                                     |
| 53:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:29      | You have to wipe your device for this and then restoring it messes a bunch of stuff up.               |
| 53:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:34      | I think they intentionally wanted to make it hard because they want people to just casually           |
| 53:38      | push a button and then find out that they lost a bunch of data or something.                          |
| 53:42      | It will get better.                                                                                   |
| 53:43      | There's going to be a public beta later.                                                              |
| 53:44      | I'm going to probably get in before the public data, but I just want to give it...                    |
| 53:48      | I'm probably going to wait till second or third.                                                      |
| 53:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 53:51      | I would highly recommend that.                                                                        |
| 53:53      | Even if you're a developer and you're not yet ready to do all this stuff, you know, you               |
| 53:57      | don't need to worry usually about missing out because the developer betas do release                  |
| 54:01      | pretty quickly.                                                                                       |
| 54:02      | I mean, by the time you're listening to this, there may already be another developer beta,            |
| 54:06      | which is more stable.                                                                                 |
| 54:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 54:08      | Usually it's a week after, but either way, it's going to get better.                                  |
| 54:12      | And the other thing that happens, if you're not a developer, but you're just curious about            |
| 54:16      | this stuff, is I often find because of the features and because all the [[Apple]] ecosystem               |
| 54:21      | is so tied together, it's like once you download the beta somewhere, then one place, then things      |
| 54:27      | start breaking.                                                                                       |
| 54:28      | It's almost encourages you to just download the betas everywhere to kind of keep everything           |
| 54:32      | on the same thing.                                                                                    |
| 54:33      | Well, I mean, there's a lot of features that don't work unless you're on the beta on everything       |
| 54:37      | or you have to disconnect devices.                                                                    |
| 54:39      | So the new [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] features, we haven't talked about [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] at all.                              |
| 54:42      | It's more of a Mac Perry uses topic than an Automator's topic, but there's some amazing               |
| 54:46      | new features in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], but when I opened [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], it was like, hey, you have seven              |
| 54:51      | devices connected that do not support this version of [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                      |
| 54:55      | Just push this button and let me convert your database so it doesn't work anywhere else.              |
| 54:58      | Yeah, which I did not click the button.                                                               |
| 55:01      | I did not click that button.                                                                          |
| 55:04      | And that's why you get like, I know in my case, I get like this weird feeling and within              |
| 55:10      | a week of me downloading a beta and one device, I have it everywhere.                                 |
| 55:14      | So just stay clear that even if in the past you've been brave, hold off for a while.                  |
| 55:20      | I assume when they get to the public beta, things are going to be more stable if you                  |
| 55:23      | really want to go out in the limb, but you know, everybody says that Rose, I think it's               |
| 55:27      | funny.                                                                                                |
| 55:28      | All of us podcasters keep telling people don't download the beta, do what I say, not what             |
| 55:32      | I do.                                                                                                 |
| 55:33      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 55:34      | All of us end up downloading.                                                                         |
| 55:35      | We can't help ourselves.                                                                              |
| 55:36      | But we're doing it for you.                                                                           |
| 55:37      | For our favourite listeners.                                                                           |
| 55:38      | At least that's what we tell ourselves.                                                               |
| 55:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 55:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 55:41      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 55:42      | Let's just talk a little bit about being here in San Jose.                                            |
| 55:44      | The meet up was amazing.                                                                               |
| 55:46      | Well, let's start with our Orange County meet up because we had two meetings since our last            |
| 55:49      | episode.                                                                                              |
| 55:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 55:51      | That was amazing.                                                                                     |
| 55:52      | We were in Orange County at the Irvine Spectrum.                                                      |
| 55:54      | I bought an iPad.                                                                                     |
| 55:55      | I bought that before everybody got there, so people didn't have to wait for me to pick                |
| 55:58      | up my iPad.                                                                                           |
| 55:59      | But yeah, it was amazing.                                                                             |
| 56:01      | We had so many people come.                                                                           |
| 56:02      | Lots of folks showed up.                                                                              |
| 56:03      | We had somebody there from Florida and our friend JF came in from Las Vegas and I don't               |
| 56:09      | know what was it about?                                                                               |
| 56:11      | 30, 35 people.                                                                                        |
| 56:12      | About 30-ish people and all walks of life.                                                            |
| 56:15      | We had several musicians there.                                                                       |
| 56:18      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 56:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 56:20      | We had a soccer player.                                                                               |
| 56:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 56:22      | And it was really great talking to automators, listeners, and hearing how you guys are using          |
| 56:25      | automation and also just hanging out together.                                                        |
| 56:28      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 56:29      | And then of course we all went to the cool Apple store they have down there, which is                 |
| 56:32      | kind of amazing.                                                                                      |
| 56:34      | And then we had the meet up here in San Jose.                                                          |
| 56:39      | That was the day we did, [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] and I did the interview with the [[Apple]] guy.                          |
| 56:41      | So we actually had to push the thing back to two o'clock.                                             |
| 56:46      | But when I got there, it's kind of funny because I got there at two, the time it was designated.      |
| 56:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 56:51      | So I got there early because, as you may have heard at the beginning of the episode, I sprained       |
| 56:56      | my ankle, which means I'm not super mobile, I'm on crutches right now.                                |
| 56:59      | So I got there at 12 because I was concerned that originally the meet up had been at 12,               |
| 57:03      | so people would be showing up at 12.                                                                  |
| 57:06      | And I didn't want anybody to feel like they were completely lost.                                     |
| 57:10      | So I thought, well, I'll get there at 12 and see who shows up.                                        |
| 57:14      | And a couple of people showed up pretty early, which was fun.                                         |
| 57:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 57:18      | So I got there too.                                                                                   |
| 57:19      | And the location we were at is like a lot of outdoor seating.                                         |
| 57:23      | And I just walked through and I saw this table, this big set of tables with a whole bunch             |
| 57:28      | of people.                                                                                            |
| 57:29      | I'm like, oh, that must be some company meet up because it's two o'clock, this is the start            |
| 57:32      | timer.                                                                                                |
| 57:33      | That can't be us.                                                                                     |
| 57:34      | And I literally walked right past it.                                                                 |
| 57:35      | Oh, you probably didn't see me.                                                                       |
| 57:36      | I walked past it and I walked all the way around the circuit.                                         |
| 57:39      | The whole thing was a big outdoor area.                                                               |
| 57:40      | And then finally I said, where is everybody?                                                          |
| 57:42      | I was going to text rows and I went back.                                                             |
| 57:45      | I looked at that big table full of people again.                                                      |
| 57:47      | And I realised, hey, there's a lady there with crutches.                                              |
| 57:50      | That must be us.                                                                                      |
| 57:51      | You know?                                                                                             |
| 57:52      | So I went over and it was like, it was the meeting place.                                             |
| 57:56      | It was like, it was like the round table of automation.                                               |
| 58:00      | The Siri shortcut scene was there.                                                                    |
| 58:02      | There was a bunch of guys from the [[Automator\|Apple Automator]]/[[AppleScript]] stuff.                          |
| 58:07      | There were a bunch of users and power users.                                                          |
| 58:09      | [[Adam Tow\|Adam]] was there.                                                                                       |
| 58:11      | [[Sal Soghoian]] was there.                                                                              |
| 58:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 58:13      | Joe from [[Timery]] was there.                                                                            |
| 58:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 58:15      | I mean, it was like, it was, I mean.                                                                  |
| 58:17      | It was the automation meet up of [[WWDC]].                                                                  |
| 58:20      | I'm really proud of the fact that all those people not only listened to the show, but                 |
| 58:24      | they took their time to come.                                                                         |
| 58:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 58:26      | It was so nice.                                                                                       |
| 58:28      | And for all of the regular listeners that came, I don't mean this in a negative way.                  |
| 58:32      | I mean, you don't happen to work for [[Apple]] or develop an app that we use every day.                   |
| 58:38      | It was amazing to see everybody there and it went that everybody could talk to each                   |
| 58:41      | other.                                                                                                |
| 58:42      | And from what I saw, everyone was having an amazing time.                                             |
| 58:44      | So I'm so glad that everybody came.                                                                   |
| 58:46      | Because it was great fun.                                                                             |
| 58:47      | And you know, just normal users also were super useful to the developers there because                |
| 58:52      | they could talk about what their priorities were.                                                     |
| 58:55      | And it just looked to me like everyone was having a really good time and it was such                  |
| 58:59      | a joy to be a little part of putting that together.                                                   |
| 59:02      | It was.                                                                                               |
| 59:03      | And a thank you to everybody that came.                                                               |
| 59:05      | For those of you who couldn't come, who wanted to come, my plan is, I have an exciting plan           |
| 59:11      | for [[WWDC]] next year.                                                                                   |
| 59:13      | It involves no sprained ankles, but also probably no scooters, but it does involve another            |
| 59:19      | automator's meet up or two.                                                                            |
| 59:20      | 100% less scooter next year.                                                                          |
| 59:22      | Oh yeah.                                                                                              |
| 59:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 59:24      | There was only one scooter ride this year.                                                            |
| 59:25      | And so 100% less next year.                                                                           |
| 59:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 59:27      | We want to build on the meetup, though.                                                               |
| 59:28      | We're going to do something cool next year.                                                           |
| 59:29      | We have no idea what it is as we say here, but we've got ideas.                                       |
| 59:34      | So we will figure that out.                                                                           |
| 59:36      | The also just the [[WWDC]] experience has always been amazing.                                            |
| 59:40      | This year seems very positive and optimistic.                                                         |
| 59:44      | I think a lot of people are happy with a new hardware, even though none of us can afford              |
| 59:48      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 59:49      | And the and really just I just wrote a post to MacSparky this morning.                               |
| 59:54      | I feel like there is a renewed focus on Mac and iPad that we haven't really seen.                     |
| 59:59      | I mean, that we've we've heard through the grapevine that is coming for whatever reason,              |
| 01:00:05   | [[Apple]] has turned a lot of its attention back towards products other than the iPhone.                  |
| 01:00:10   | And for people like us that make our livings working on iPads and Macs, I think that's                |
| 01:00:15   | great news.                                                                                           |
| 01:00:16   | It is.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:17   | It is.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:18   | It's such great news.                                                                                 |
| 01:00:19   | And I mean, it's just fun being here and looking at all this stuff and trying to think                |
| 01:00:25   | of the possibilities.                                                                                 |
| 01:00:26   | My brain is excited.                                                                                  |
| 01:00:28   | And so it's probably missed 8 billion of the things that you can do.                                  |
| 01:00:32   | And it's just focusing on the five things that my brain thinks is awesome right now.                  |
| 01:00:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:36   | It's good fun.                                                                                        |
| 01:00:37   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:38   | And when we're unpacking this, we're going to discover even more goodness in all this.                |
| 01:00:42   | But anyway, so I guess the story from San Jose in 2019 from Rose and Dave is, hey, guys,              |
| 01:00:49   | we got we got great toys coming for Siri shortcuts and it's going to be more accessible               |
| 01:00:54   | than ever.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:55   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:00:56   | And everybody's going to get this in September, you know, when we when we get those new iPhones,      |
| 01:01:00   | this iOS is going to roll out to everybody from experience.                                           |
| 01:01:03   | It will probably just start installing at some point for those people who don't like                  |
| 01:01:07   | to tap the update button and then everybody's got everything.                                         |
| 01:01:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:11   | So you can drop a shortcut on your grandma's grandma's iPad and just have it do that thing            |
| 01:01:15   | that needs to be done whenever she opens this application.                                            |
| 01:01:19   | Let us know in the forums what you're most excited about, maybe some of your automation               |
| 01:01:23   | ideas that were sparked through the stuff we talked about today.                                      |
| 01:01:26   | And we we will see you in a couple of weeks.                                                          |
| 01:01:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:31   | Thank you for listening and we will talk to you in two weeks.                                         |
| 01:01:34   | Bye.                                                                                                  |

| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators,                                                                  |
| 00:04      | the show where we talk about making your devices do your work for you.                            |
| 00:07      | Hello, David.                                                                                     |
| 00:08      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                                                  |
| 00:10      | How are you?                                                                                      |
| 00:11      | I'm great. I'm looking forward to talking about Siri Shortcuts.                                   |
| 00:14      | It's always a fun topic and Ground Zero for Automation and the Automators.                        |
| 00:19      | I don't know if we ever told the show the story about the origin of the show.                     |
| 00:23      | When we had planned it,                                                                           |
| 00:24      | we had recorded shows and we went to                                                              |
| 00:26      | [[WWDC]] and [[Apple]] announced Siri Shortcuts and we had to throw                                       |
| 00:29      | a bunch of episodes in the trash and start over again.                                            |
| 00:31      | Yeah. I mean, they're not completely gone just for the really curious.                            |
| 00:35      | They're sitting on a hard drive in my desk.                                                       |
| 00:38      | But they were all about workflow and things like that,                                            |
| 00:42      | so not great concept when Shortcuts was just being released.                                      |
| 00:46      | Yeah. Well, we're talking today about updates to Siri Shortcuts and it's not June.                |
| 00:51      | I know.                                                                                           |
| 00:52      | What's up with that?                                                                              |
| 00:52      | Well, it's March.                                                                                 |
| 00:54      | I mean, there's an [[Apple]] event probably coming shortly after this episode releases.               |
| 00:57      | It hasn't been announced as we record,                                                            |
| 00:59      | but I mean, we don't have crystal balls.                                                          |
| 01:03      | I mean, I don't have a crystal ball at the very least, David.                                     |
| 01:05      | I'm not sure about you.                                                                           |
| 01:06      | So we don't know if Shortcuts is going to make it onto the stage,                                 |
| 01:08      | but yeah, there are updates and this is unusual for [[Apple]].                                        |
| 01:14      | Yeah. I mean, I think normally we can count on.                                                   |
| 01:16      | I mean, Siri Shortcuts is really considered in a lot of ways,                                     |
| 01:19      | a feature of the operating system.                                                                |
| 01:21      | Usually, you only see updates to the operating system in June.                                    |
| 01:25      | You know, when they announced at [[WWDC]] and they shipped sometime in September.                     |
| 01:29      | For instance, [[Apple Mail]], the app that we like to beat up on because it never gets updates.       |
| 01:34      | There's no chance that we're going to see an update to [[Apple Mail]] anytime other than June.        |
| 01:40      | But for whatever reason,                                                                          |
| 01:42      | Siri Shortcuts, partly because it's a separate download I would presume,                          |
| 01:46      | has been getting regular updates since it originally shipped                                      |
| 01:49      | and it's very encouraging to see an Apple product,                                                |
| 01:52      | especially an automation-themed product,                                                          |
| 01:54      | where they just keep putting the gas down.                                                        |
| 01:57      | Yeah, it is.                                                                                      |
| 01:58      | And this is one of the very few [[Apple]] apps                                                        |
| 02:01      | rather than operating system that you can get a beta invite for.                                  |
| 02:05      | Now, I will grant you, you have to be a developer for this.                                       |
| 02:08      | That's not just having one of the free developer accounts,                                        |
| 02:10      | that's having one of the $99 a year developer accounts.                                           |
| 02:13      | And you have to sign up for it and you may or may not get a spot.                                 |
| 02:17      | Now, I have heard from a lot of people, and I'm pretty certain this is the case,                  |
| 02:21      | a lot of the people who were on the workflow beta have been invited to the Shortcuts beta,        |
| 02:26      | but that ship has long since sailed, the workflow beta no longer exists.                          |
| 02:30      | So the only way that you can get onto it now is if you're a developer,                            |
| 02:34      | if you're not already on it.                                                                      |
| 02:36      | But that's another thing that's unusual for [[Apple]].                                                |
| 02:40      | They don't usually offer betas of their apps.                                                     |
| 02:42      | iMovie doesn't have a beta.                                                                       |
| 02:44      | Shortcuts does, Classroom app, which is a very niche project does,                                |
| 02:48      | but this is quite unusual.                                                                        |
| 02:51      | Yeah, and since they, since we first covered Siri Shortcuts,                                      |
| 02:55      | one that originally released, [[Apple]] has released an update.                                       |
| 02:58      | They want the 2.1 update came out in late 2019.                                                   |
| 03:02      | And right now as we sit here, both of us are on the beta for the 2.2 update.                      |
| 03:07      | And these are not just bug fixes.                                                                 |
| 03:09      | They've added new features and new app integrations.                                              |
| 03:12      | And we thought it was time to catch up with that.                                                 |
| 03:14      | And kind of on that theme, I'm, as this course publishes,                                         |
| 03:18      | I'm releasing the 1.1 update of the MacSparky Siri Shortcuts field guide.                        |
| 03:25      | I've already added, as we record six videos,                                                      |
| 03:27      | they'll probably be at least about another five or six.                                           |
| 03:30      | I've got a bunch that I've recorded.                                                              |
| 03:31      | I'm still editing.                                                                                |
| 03:33      | If you are, if you are already a customer, just go in there and you'll see                        |
| 03:37      | that all the courses, all the individual courses have either 1.0 or 1.1 in the name now.          |
| 03:43      | If it has a 1.1, obviously that's a new one.                                                      |
| 03:47      | As this course, as this publishes, I'm still getting all the closed captioning done.              |
| 03:51      | So on the 1.1, the closed caption isn't there yet.                                                |
| 03:54      | But if you need that, it'll be there soon.                                                        |
| 03:56      | And also just for giggles, I'm going to put out a discount code just for automators,              |
| 04:01      | listeners, we're not going to write this down anywhere.                                           |
| 04:04      | It's auto-siri, one word, A-U-T-O-S-I-R-I, that'll get you $10 off.                               |
| 04:09      | But it's only going to be good for one week after the show publishes.                             |
| 04:12      | So go to learn.macsparky.com.                                                                     |
| 04:15      | You can download videos for a bunch of the stuff we're going to talk about today.                 |
| 04:20      | And also, I'm going to include a couple of the videos in the feed for the show.                   |
| 04:25      | So you can go ahead and just watch those for free.                                                |
| 04:28      | Enough marketing there, enough talking about my stuff.                                            |
| 04:31      | Well, I mean, it's very useful content.                                                           |
| 04:33      | And even if you're not in a position where you can afford a course,                               |
| 04:37      | or you think you already know everything about shortcuts,                                         |
| 04:39      | it's not when nobody knows everything about shortcuts,                                            |
| 04:41      | except perhaps the developers.                                                                    |
| 04:42      | But David's got some really great ideas and the free videos that he's sharing are excellent.      |
| 04:47      | So please do watch those.                                                                         |
| 04:49      | Very enjoyable.                                                                                   |
| 04:50      | Yeah, I really, it's like every time I open the app, I do figure out new things.                  |
| 04:53      | It's interesting how, because it's such a different programming paradigm.                         |
| 04:58      | I mean, recently we had John Siracusa on who's coming at it from the traditional                  |
| 05:02      | programmer model, whereas I'm not, I did my fair share of programming back in the day,            |
| 05:09      | but I certainly don't pay for my shoes doing it.                                                  |
| 05:12      | And I do like the visual interface of programming, and it is kind of fun,                         |
| 05:17      | kind of up with new ways to figure this stuff out every time you open the app.                    |
| 05:21      | Agreed.                                                                                           |
| 05:23      | So there have been updates.                                                                       |
| 05:25      | We should probably talk about what happened in these updates, didn't we?                          |
| 05:28      | Yeah, let's start with the 2.1 update.                                                            |
| 05:31      | Since that one is already out, we're hoping that by the time you get this show,                   |
| 05:35      | the 2.2 update will be out, but we know the 2.1 update is out.                                    |
| 05:40      | So the tools we're about to talk about are already in your pocket.                                |
| 05:44      | Yes.                                                                                              |
| 05:44      | And let's start with weather, because everybody loves talking about the weather, don't they?      |
| 05:49      | Or is that just me being British?                                                                 |
| 05:52      | I don't really care about the weather, because I'm in California.                                 |
| 05:54      | Well, you have been California, so you're just showing off.                                       |
| 05:56      | It's always the same there, unless it's on fire.                                                  |
| 05:59      | Yeah, that's true, and that's a whole different thing.                                            |
| 06:02      | But actually, we've had a lot of rain this year,                                                  |
| 06:05      | so I have been suddenly watching the weather for a little bit, but that won't last long.          |
| 06:11      | Well, with the weather, shortcuts has added direct weather integration.                           |
| 06:17      | So previously, you were pretty much stuck with something like                                     |
| 06:21      | Carrot or DarkSky API and doing all sorts of weird and complicated things,                         |
| 06:27      | which, depending on your level of expertise with shortcuts,                                       |
| 06:30      | may not have actually been weird or complicated.                                                  |
| 06:33      | But now, they are built in weather features.                                                      |
| 06:36      | So you can get the weather forecast, and you can choose to get it at your current location        |
| 06:40      | or a specific location.                                                                           |
| 06:42      | And then you can get details of this, and you can get all sorts of wonderful information.         |
| 06:49      | So you can get the high temperature, the low temperature, the fields like temperature,            |
| 06:53      | the visibility, dew point, UV index, sunrise and sunset times.                                    |
| 06:58      | And you don't need to calculate any of these.                                                     |
| 07:00      | You don't need to translate it.                                                                   |
| 07:02      | So if I get the sunrise time, then I'm getting that as a time time.                               |
| 07:08      | It's not seconds since epoch or anything like that,                                               |
| 07:12      | where I need to go and figure it out.                                                             |
| 07:13      | It is the time.                                                                                   |
| 07:15      | Yeah, I mean, I can't understate how much easier working with time is now in Siri Shortcuts.      |
| 07:22      | Before, what you had to do is there was no access to it in the general Siri Shortcuts system.     |
| 07:28      | So the way we were doing it was with API calls.                                                   |
| 07:31      | I mean, that was always the one example of an API call that everybody could relate to,            |
| 07:37      | because everybody at some point wants to try and automate something around weather.               |
| 07:42      | And now it is just tons and tons better.                                                          |
| 07:46      | Number one is you don't have to do goofy API calls.                                               |
| 07:48      | Go get an account with Dark Sky and do all that.                                                  |
| 07:51      | And then number two is the data they are giving you is pretty much everything that the iPhone has |
| 07:57      | in terms of the current weather.                                                                  |
| 07:58      | And not only the current weather, but also forecast weather.                                      |
| 08:02      | So you can look into the future with what you can forecast data out of it as well.                |
| 08:06      | And like Rose was saying, the big hang up once you got the API call was you had to convert        |
| 08:14      | some universal weather, you know, basic to what you, the information you wanted,                  |
| 08:20      | which was never easy and always complicated.                                                      |
| 08:23      | And I guess I'd say the whole thing runs faster now too,                                          |
| 08:25      | because whenever you do an API call, Siri Shortcuts has to go to the internet.                    |
| 08:30      | You got to have an internet connection.                                                           |
| 08:31      | It's got to get the information.                                                                  |
| 08:33      | It's got to pull it back.                                                                         |
| 08:34      | Whereas the weather data, at least in my experience,                                              |
| 08:37      | my weather shortcuts are much faster now.                                                         |
| 08:39      | Yeah. I mean, one of the other advantages to this is you can do a lot of this with the            |
| 08:44      | Carrot Shortcuts, which the developer of the Carrot Weather app,                                  |
| 08:47      | which is the homicidal weather app, the threatens to kill me every second day.                    |
| 08:51      | It does, is he also provides all of this information, which is amazing.                           |
| 08:57      | But you have to use the clipboard because unfortunately,                                          |
| 08:59      | Shortcuts doesn't let him provide that information directly back to the shortcut.                 |
| 09:04      | So he has to put it on the clipboard because there's no other way of doing that.                  |
| 09:08      | But because this is a built-in action, it provides output.                                        |
| 09:12      | And it provides this in a way so that if you then under, say, for example,                        |
| 09:15      | get current weather, add a text block,                                                            |
| 09:18      | then what you can do is you can tap to insert the magic variable weather conditions.              |
| 09:24      | And then you've got all of the options.                                                           |
| 09:26      | So you can specify that from weather conditions, you want the pressure.                           |
| 09:29      | So you can write a little thing that Siri would read to you.                                      |
| 09:34      | That would probably be better in the results action.                                              |
| 09:37      | And then you can have all of this information without set variable,                               |
| 09:41      | get variable, get details of weather conditions, et cetera.                                       |
| 09:46      | You can actually just condense this all down into one very small little shortcut,                 |
| 09:52      | which gives you exactly the information you need.                                                 |
| 09:54      | So if, for example, you have a good morning shortcut,                                             |
| 09:58      | which walks you through what's happening today.                                                   |
| 10:01      | And if you live in California like David does,                                                    |
| 10:03      | and you really only care if it's going to rain today and when it's going to rain,                 |
| 10:06      | you can tell it to get the precipitation, for example, for the day.                               |
| 10:11      | The precipitation amount or precipitation chance.                                                 |
| 10:14      | And it'll only tell you if it's above a 5% chance of precipitation, for example.                  |
| 10:18      | So as an example, the shortcut I'm going to share from today's show allows you,                   |
| 10:24      | it's a shortcut that gives you today's weather or tomorrow's weather                              |
| 10:29      | and just gives me the information I want.                                                         |
| 10:31      | You can go in and customise this.                                                                 |
| 10:32      | So when you open it up, it first gets the location of where your phone is.                        |
| 10:37      | So because it's going to need that to get the weather later.                                      |
| 10:39      | And then it just has a list and it says, do you want today or tomorrow?                           |
| 10:43      | And then you could do more of these, but I mean, it's simple.                                     |
| 10:47      | And then you input from that, whether it's today or tomorrow.                                     |
| 10:50      | And if it's today, it gets your current location, which you've already drawn.                     |
| 10:55      | And then it goes and it chooses from the list because what it's doing on the                      |
| 10:59      | weather end is it's got a list of forecasts over the next, I believe, 10 days.                    |
| 11:03      | So you get to choose which one of those you want.                                                 |
| 11:05      | If you wanted it three days from now,                                                             |
| 11:07      | you'd pick the third item as opposed to the first item.                                           |
| 11:12      | Actually, that'd be the fourth item because today is the first item.                              |
| 11:15      | Anyway, so it pulls all that weather and then it gets all of that as one data dump.               |
| 11:20      | And then I made just a show result field where you could have done                                |
| 11:25      | some of the text box too, where I just write some text.                                           |
| 11:28      | And the ones that were important to me was I wanted to know the first I said                      |
| 11:32      | the weather today in the current location city.                                                   |
| 11:35      | So it's just telling me the city that I'm in rather than the address I'm at.                      |
| 11:38      | And then it has some text that's the high and low.                                                |
| 11:41      | So I'm going to know the high temperature and the low temperature,                                |
| 11:43      | which frankly is the most important thing for me most of the year.                                |
| 11:47      | And then the chance of rain percentage.                                                           |
| 11:50      | You could have had it tell the amount of rain if we know it's raining.                            |
| 11:54      | You could have told you what the forecasted amount of rain.                                       |
| 11:58      | But here, once again, I just want to know if it's going to rain.                                  |
| 12:01      | And then I also have to give me the sunrise and sunset times                                      |
| 12:04      | because I, you know, sometimes I want to go work out in the garden                                |
| 12:07      | or maybe go do some exercise.                                                                     |
| 12:08      | I'd like to do that before it gets dark.                                                          |
| 12:10      | So I just have those are the bits of data I have.                                                 |
| 12:15      | And then I put that in an if statement.                                                           |
| 12:17      | And then the otherwise half of that statement pulls the forecast for tomorrow.                    |
| 12:22      | So instead of looking from the list, the the first item,                                          |
| 12:26      | I pull item number two in the index, which would be tomorrow.                                     |
| 12:29      | If I wanted to do that for three more days, I could add more statements.                          |
| 12:34      | And pull index three, four and five.                                                              |
| 12:36      | And I could get the forecast over five days.                                                      |
| 12:39      | It's not super complicated.                                                                       |
| 12:41      | Once you look at this, like I said, I'll put the shortcut in the in the show notes                |
| 12:46      | so you can just download it and play with it.                                                     |
| 12:48      | And I'll also upload a video demonstrating how I use it.                                          |
| 12:52      | But it's really nice to be able to create that on your own.                                       |
| 12:55      | So I know there's weather apps out there, but getting the customised weather you want.            |
| 13:01      | Just the information you want.                                                                    |
| 13:03      | There probably isn't an app that makes it just the way you want it.                               |
| 13:07      | Yes. And of course, the advantage of this is you can use it by Siri.                              |
| 13:11      | And if you're using the show result, then it would show that text in Siri.                        |
| 13:14      | And that does mean that you can activate this on something like a HomePod.                        |
| 13:18      | So you can be talking, you can just walk around your home and you can say,                        |
| 13:21      | you know, hello HomePod, good morning.                                                            |
| 13:24      | And your HomePod will then go, oh, right.                                                         |
| 13:27      | Yes, that's the trigger.                                                                          |
| 13:28      | I need to run the good morning shortcut and it will do whatever that entails,                     |
| 13:32      | including getting all the weather.                                                                |
| 13:33      | And it can do that easily because that's built into shortcuts                                     |
| 13:36      | and it has access to all of this information.                                                     |
| 13:39      | When Siri Shortcuts first launched,                                                               |
| 13:41      | everybody made their own version of the daily status report shortcut.                             |
| 13:46      | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| 13:46      | You know, where you have a shortcut that says, you know, hello, Rosemary.                         |
| 13:51      | Today you have three appointments.                                                                |
| 13:52      | Your first appointment is blah, blah, blah.                                                       |
| 13:54      | And the weather is blah, blah, blah.                                                              |
| 13:56      | This is a great, these tools make that much easier.                                               |
| 14:00      | Where before you had to go to API calls and do put yourself                                       |
| 14:04      | through all sorts of contortions to get that data.                                                |
| 14:06      | If you want to make your own daily status shortcut,                                               |
| 14:09      | and I would recommend putting that in the show results as well                                    |
| 14:12      | for the exact same reason Rose just explained.                                                    |
| 14:14      | You know, you could put your appointments,                                                        |
| 14:16      | you could put, you know, the time, the weather, you know, whatever.                               |
| 14:21      | And it's kind of nice making your own little status update.                                       |
| 14:24      | It feels a little Star Trek to me.                                                                |
| 14:26      | I kind of like that.                                                                              |
| 14:29      | Okay. Well, it's time for our first sponsor break.                                                |
| 14:31      | And I would like to thank Creative Next for being the sponsor                                     |
| 14:34      | of this podcast, Automators.                                                                      |
| 14:37      | So this episode of Automators is brought to you by Creative Next.                                 |
| 14:40      | Creative Next is a new podcast focusing on future-proofing creators                               |
| 14:44      | from AI Automation.                                                                               |
| 14:47      | They believe the future of automation is about people like you and me,                            |
| 14:50      | because work automation isn't all about industrial robots.                                        |
| 14:54      | Automation driven by artificial intelligence                                                      |
| 14:57      | is already doing remarkable things,                                                               |
| 14:59      | like impacting research, writing, marketing, art, design,                                         |
| 15:03      | engineering, and entrepreneurship.                                                                |
| 15:05      | And this kind of thing is likely to accelerate in years to come.                                  |
| 15:09      | So this is what Creative Next covers.                                                             |
| 15:12      | The first season is about learning, learning about AI and automation,                             |
| 15:17      | understanding how machines learn with early automation successes                                  |
| 15:21      | and how people will look at these in years to come.                                               |
| 15:25      | Creative Next is available from Apple Podcasts,                                                   |
| 15:27      | Google Podcasts, Spotify,                                                                         |
| 15:29      | and wherever else you'd like to listen to your podcast.                                           |
| 15:32      | Plus, they have a companion article series on Medium                                              |
| 15:34      | that's in partnership with Towards Data Science.                                                  |

| 15:45      | Our thanks to Creative Next for their support of this show                                        |
| 15:48      | and all of Relay FM.                                                                              |
| 15:50      | Okay, that wasn't just the weather that we got updates for in the 2.1, though.                    |
| 15:55      | We also got updates for the clock.                                                                |
| 15:56      | And this was one of the things that used to kind of make me nuts                                  |
| 15:59      | about Siri Shortcuts was when it shipped,                                                         |
| 16:02      | you could add clock functions like alarms and timers.                                             |
| 16:06      | But there was no way to just set them in Siri Shortcuts                                           |
| 16:10      | and said you had to go create them on your phone                                                  |
| 16:13      | and sometimes create them multiple times.                                                         |
| 16:15      | And I had this whole thing I would go through.                                                    |
| 16:17      | I'd create an alarm and then I would force quit Siri Shortcuts                                    |
| 16:21      | and reopen Siri Shortcuts.                                                                        |
| 16:22      | And usually that would be enough to get it to say,                                                |
| 16:24      | oh, yeah, he made an alarm, you want to add that?                                                 |
| 16:27      | Yeah, yeah, that was like one of the most annoying things ever                                    |
| 16:32      | because I have an alarm set for 7.15 every day                                                    |
| 16:36      | because if I don't wake up when my first alarm goes off,                                          |
| 16:38      | I need to be up at 7.15,                                                                          |
| 16:41      | otherwise my day is just going to go horribly.                                                    |
| 16:43      | So I always have this alarm, but it's not always enabled                                          |
| 16:47      | just because various different things happen.                                                     |
| 16:49      | It might be that I need to actually be up by 7 for some things                                    |
| 16:51      | depending on what day of the week it is                                                           |
| 16:53      | if we're recording automators earlier or later in my day                                          |
| 16:57      | and things like that.                                                                             |
| 16:58      | But 7.15 is an alarm that I regularly set                                                         |
| 17:01      | and I set this via Siri and it would not show up.                                                 |
| 17:05      | I don't know what was happening,                                                                  |
| 17:06      | but this one particular alarm,                                                                    |
| 17:08      | the one that I need most frequently would not show up.                                            |
| 17:12      | And so now I don't have to worry about that                                                       |
| 17:14      | because I can, if I search for alarm,                                                             |
| 17:17      | then I've got two options.                                                                        |
| 17:18      | I can create an alarm or I can toggle an alarm                                                    |
| 17:20      | and I can create one and I can give it a name                                                     |
| 17:23      | and then I can set the time                                                                       |
| 17:24      | and whether or not I would like it to repeat,                                                     |
| 17:27      | which is a very useful feature                                                                    |
| 17:29      | because you can say, for example,                                                                 |
| 17:31      | if you are going to be, for example,                                                              |
| 17:34      | teaching somewhere for a week                                                                     |
| 17:36      | or you're going to be on a work trip,                                                             |
| 17:38      | then you can set an alarm                                                                         |
| 17:40      | and you can have it repeat Monday to Friday                                                       |
| 17:41      | and you can say, okay, well, this is work trip two                                                |
| 17:45      | out of the four different work trips that I regularly do.                                         |
| 17:48      | So I need to set my alarm to this                                                                 |
| 17:50      | for this particular work trip and turn it on                                                      |
| 17:52      | and then you can have a return from work trip one                                                 |
| 17:54      | which toggles that alarm and turns it off for you.                                                |
| 17:58      | So I like that a lot.                                                                             |
| 18:01      | Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that you can not only create them                                  |
| 18:03      | but you can turn them off                                                                         |
| 18:04      | so that opens up a whole bunch of options.                                                        |
| 18:07      | You can also add multiple alarms with a single shortcut.                                          |
| 18:11      | So let's say we'll talk about the work trip                                                       |
| 18:14      | and on the work trip,                                                                             |
| 18:15      | you've got a couple of things like number,                                                        |
| 18:17      | you've got to wake up at a different time every day,                                              |
| 18:19      | you've got to maybe you want to set an alarm                                                      |
| 18:23      | for a lunch break or a nap break.                                                                 |
| 18:26      | And then let's say you need to get back to check your email                                       |
| 18:30      | and kind of check things back at the office.                                                      |
| 18:32      | So you want to, whatever you're doing                                                             |
| 18:34      | while you're in your work trip at 4 p.m.,                                                         |
| 18:36      | you want to go find time to kind of like do the daily update.                                     |
| 18:40      | So you've got these different alarms                                                              |
| 18:42      | for a short period of time.                                                                       |
| 18:43      | You could create all three of those alarms                                                        |
| 18:45      | in a single shortcut.                                                                             |
| 18:46      | You could trigger it through the shortcuts app                                                    |
| 18:49      | or with your voice or whatever.                                                                   |
| 18:51      | And then like you said,                                                                           |
| 18:51      | when you finish trip, turn it off,                                                                |
| 18:53      | but then you've still got that shortcut available to you.                                         |
| 18:55      | So the next time you take a trip, you do the same thing.                                          |
| 18:58      | I think if you traveled a lot,                                                                    |
| 18:59      | I think this could be really useful.                                                              |
| 19:00      | Oh yeah.                                                                                          |
| 19:01      | I mean, that's one of the things that I use it for a lot                                          |
| 19:03      | because when I'm traveling,                                                                       |
| 19:05      | I can get up much later usually than I can get up here                                            |
| 19:08      | because I don't usually have to commute to work.                                                  |
| 19:11      | And if I do have to commute to work                                                               |
| 19:12      | from somewhere like Chicago,                                                                      |
| 19:13      | it's gonna take me a very long time                                                               |
| 19:14      | and I'm gonna have to set a very early alarm.                                                     |
| 19:17      | Let's just say really quick how much I appreciate                                                 |
| 19:20      | what you did.                                                                                     |
| 19:21      | For those of you listening who don't know,                                                        |
| 19:22      | Rose came all the way to Chicago a few weeks ago                                                  |
| 19:25      | and joined us on Mac Power users life.                                                            |
| 19:27      | It was great.                                                                                     |
| 19:28      | It was excellent fun.                                                                             |
| 19:29      | And if you haven't heard the episode of my power users,                                           |
| 19:31      | I'd highly recommend you go back and listen to it.                                                |
| 19:33      | I got a new MacBook Air and I'm all in love with it.                                              |
| 19:36      | Still in love with it?                                                                            |
| 19:37      | Oh, it's so pretty.                                                                               |
| 19:38      | Of course I'm in love with it.                                                                    |
| 19:40      | Good, good.                                                                                       |
| 19:41      | We had her on a social media lock down.                                                            |
| 19:43      | So when she came to Chicago,                                                                      |
| 19:44      | she wasn't allowed to tweet or anything.                                                          |
| 19:47      | Yes.                                                                                              |
| 19:48      | Anyway, another use for these alarms I think                                                      |
| 19:51      | is the people who occasionally wake up early,                                                     |
| 19:53      | but not if you wake up early all the time,                                                        |
| 19:56      | you can just set a repeating alarm and be done with it.                                           |
| 19:59      | But if you just occasionally wake up early,                                                       |
| 20:02      | that's hard because a repeating alarm just causes havoc.                                          |
| 20:08      | And maybe because you only occasionally wake up early,                                            |
| 20:11      | it's harder to get up early                                                                       |
| 20:12      | and your body isn't really ready for it.                                                          |
| 20:15      | I think [[Myke Hurley]] was telling me                                                                |
| 20:17      | he sets multiple alarms like six or seven                                                         |
| 20:20      | to get himself up.                                                                                |
| 20:22      | But if that was you,                                                                              |
| 20:23      | you could create a Siri shortcut set of six alarms,                                               |
| 20:27      | five minutes apart, starting at six a.m.                                                          |
| 20:30      | And at some point, presumably, you'll wake up.                                                    |
| 20:36      | But you could do that through automation,                                                         |
| 20:38      | which is kind of nice.                                                                            |
| 20:39      | And like I said, if you only do it infrequently,                                                  |
| 20:41      | I think it's a lot faster to do it through a Siri shortcut                                        |
| 20:44      | than to go in and manually turn those off and on.                                                 |
| 20:47      | Yeah, for somebody, this would be really great                                                    |
| 20:49      | for somebody who does shift work.                                                                 |
| 20:50      | So for example, they've got one week of night shifts,                                             |
| 20:52      | one week of evening shifts, one week of day shifts,                                               |
| 20:54      | and one week of early morning shifts or something.                                                |
| 20:57      | And if you switch between multiple different kinds                                                |
| 21:01      | of start times and finish times,                                                                  |
| 21:02      | you and I probably had this when we worked for Disney.                                            |
| 21:04      | I know my start and end times were all over the place,                                            |
| 21:06      | depending on what week I was in.                                                                  |
| 21:09      | Then it's great because then you can be like,                                                     |
| 21:12      | okay, well, this is week pattern one,                                                             |
| 21:14      | which means that I need reminders in my reminders                                                 |
| 21:16      | to pack my lunch at this time,                                                                    |
| 21:18      | and I need alarms set for this time,                                                              |
| 21:20      | but it will turn off all of the other ones as well.                                               |
| 21:24      | And granted, there is no,                                                                         |
| 21:27      | very least as far as I'm aware,                                                                   |
| 21:28      | there is no turn off all of the alarms.                                                           |
| 21:30      | So unfortunately, you can't start a shortcut                                                      |
| 21:32      | by turning off all the alarms                                                                     |
| 21:34      | and just enabling the ones that you want                                                          |
| 21:36      | or creating the ones that you want.                                                               |
| 21:38      | But you can toggle every single alarm that you have off.                                          |
| 21:43      | You'll have to add one toggle item for each alarm,                                                |
| 21:46      | which for some of us is a very good motivation                                                    |
| 21:49      | to actually go in and clear out the 500 alarms                                                    |
| 21:52      | that may or may not have been sitting                                                             |
| 21:53      | in my clock application for a few years.                                                          |
| 21:56      | Yeah, they do multiply, don't they?                                                               |
| 21:58      | Yeah, they do, they do,                                                                           |
| 22:00      | especially when you're just talking to it.                                                        |
| 22:02      | Yeah, I use Siri all the time to create them.                                                     |
| 22:03      | I create them for all sorts of dumb things.                                                       |
| 22:06      | Like a lot of times I have alarms attached to appointments,                                       |
| 22:08      | but if I don't have an appointment attached,                                                      |
| 22:10      | I'll just use Siri or my voice to create an alarm.                                                |
| 22:14      | And then all of a sudden I'll look in my alarm app                                                |
| 22:16      | and there are like 30 alarms in there.                                                            |
| 22:18      | You know, one for 2.38 PM.                                                                        |
| 22:21      | I have no idea why I put that there one day, but it's there.                                      |
| 22:24      | Yep, yep, that's one of these things.                                                             |
| 22:27      | And don't forget that there are separate alarms                                                   |
| 22:30      | on your [[Apple Watch\|Apple Watches]] to the ones on your iPhone as well.                                         |
| 22:33      | So you may want to pop in and check on that                                                       |
| 22:35      | if you're having a clear route.                                                                   |
| 22:37      | Those are more tedious to get rid of too,                                                         |
| 22:39      | a little bit at least.                                                                            |
| 22:40      | Oh yes, they are.                                                                                 |
| 22:42      | When I used to work at Disney,                                                                    |
| 22:43      | they had a boy they called canoe races in the summer.                                             |
| 22:48      | If you go to Disneyland, there's a river there                                                    |
| 22:50      | in the rivers of America, I believe they called.                                                  |
| 22:52      | And the employees would have these races                                                          |
| 22:55      | and you would have informed teams.                                                                |
| 22:57      | It was like a intramural competition,                                                             |
| 23:00      | but it was at like 4.30 to 5.00 AM                                                                |
| 23:02      | in the morning in the summer.                                                                     |
| 23:03      | So I would just work the night shift                                                              |
| 23:05      | and get off at like 1 or 1.30                                                                     |
| 23:08      | and then we'd go to breakfast.                                                                    |
| 23:10      | I mean, we just didn't even go to bed.                                                            |
| 23:12      | And then we'd show up and do the canoe race                                                       |
| 23:13      | and then go home and crash.                                                                       |
| 23:14      | It was just like a totally different life.                                                        |
| 23:17      | That was so easy for me back then.                                                                |
| 23:19      | I'm not sure how well I would do that today.                                                      |
| 23:22      | I'm not sure that I would really work.                                                            |
| 23:24      | I'd probably fall in the river or something.                                                      |
| 23:26      | I have days when I think I can do that really well.                                               |
| 23:28      | And then it sort of gets to the point                                                             |
| 23:30      | where I'm part of the way through the rest of my day                                              |
| 23:33      | on the other side of crashing,                                                                    |
| 23:34      | going, why did I do this to myself?                                                               |
| 23:36      | It never works that well for me.                                                                  |
| 23:37      | I'm just at the point where I accept                                                              |
| 23:39      | that I cannot do that well anymore.                                                               |
| 23:41      | All right.                                                                                        |
| 23:43      | So creating a calendar, I'm sorry,                                                                |
| 23:46      | timing events is nice with automation.                                                            |
| 23:49      | It's a lot easier than it used to be.                                                             |
| 23:51      | I don't think this is, it's super complicated.                                                    |
| 23:53      | You just literally go in and you set a timer.                                                     |
| 23:56      | But you can do fun stuff with it.                                                                 |
| 24:00      | One of the things I did was I created a Pomodoro timer                                            |
| 24:03      | that's in the new update to the Siri Shortcuts field guide.                                       |
| 24:06      | And I cleverly use do not disturb with it as well.                                                |
| 24:09      | So like you want to get into a Pomodoro timing,                                                   |
| 24:12      | turn on do not disturb,                                                                           |
| 24:13      | you can like combine things together.                                                             |
| 24:15      | So when you start thinking, okay, I have timer skills                                             |
| 24:18      | and I also have a bunch of control over the things                                                |
| 24:20      | I can do with my phone, see what you can do.                                                      |
| 24:23      | A meditation timer would be interesting                                                           |
| 24:26      | where you can just throw a button                                                                 |
| 24:27      | and let's say you're using time tracking,                                                         |
| 24:29      | you could run in, you use an API call                                                             |
| 24:31      | to run your time tracker, set your meditation timer                                               |
| 24:34      | or maybe turn your phone on do not disturb.                                                       |
| 24:37      | All of a sudden you can like create in essence little apps                                        |
| 24:40      | for yourself that do exactly things                                                               |
| 24:43      | the way you want them done.                                                                       |
| 24:44      | Yes, and this is one of the things I've done.                                                     |
| 24:46      | So I've got a series of shortcuts actually                                                        |
| 24:48      | for tracking my time at work.                                                                     |
| 24:49      | But when I start my lunch time,                                                                   |
| 24:51      | it starts a 30 minute timer                                                                       |
| 24:52      | because I get 30 minutes for lunch.                                                               |
| 24:54      | And usually I'm sitting at my desk anyway,                                                        |
| 24:57      | so if the phone rings or a very urgent email comes in,                                            |
| 25:00      | then I may stop eating and respond to it                                                          |
| 25:02      | or stop relaxing and respond to it.                                                               |
| 25:05      | But I need to be prompted to promptly change my timer back                                        |
| 25:09      | after lunch finishes.                                                                             |
| 25:10      | And so when I start specifically my lunch timer,                                                  |
| 25:13      | it starts a 30 minute timer, which is really useful                                               |
| 25:16      | because then my phone rings afterwards.                                                           |
| 25:17      | It's like, well, okay, right back into work mode.                                                 |
| 25:20      | Lunch is over.                                                                                    |
| 25:22      | Yeah, that's very useful.                                                                         |
| 25:23      | That's really nice.                                                                               |
| 25:25      | Also in the 1.1 update, they added conversions,                                                   |
| 25:28      | which was a new function.                                                                         |
| 25:31      | Forever there's been apps on your phone                                                           |
| 25:32      | that will convert like kilograms to stone.                                                        |
| 25:38      | I love stone as a unit measure, by the way.                                                       |
| 25:42      | Thank you, Rose.                                                                                  |
| 25:43      | Don't ask me what that translates to.                                                             |
| 25:44      | I have no idea.                                                                                   |
| 25:46      | I thought every British person                                                                    |
| 25:48      | was supposed to do all weights in stones.                                                         |
| 25:50      | Isn't that a law for there or something?                                                          |
| 25:53      | Oh, apparently, but I live in mainland Europe.                                                    |
| 25:57      | And I don't know, I can't envision what a stone looks like.                                       |
| 26:00      | But ask me what a kilogram of flour looks like                                                    |
| 26:02      | and I'll let you know.                                                                            |
| 26:03      | I don't feel like I'm as heavy                                                                    |
| 26:05      | when I look at my weight in stone.                                                                |
| 26:06      | So I guess that's why I like it.                                                                  |
| 26:08      | Well, there you go.                                                                               |
| 26:09      | That's a good reason to check it then.                                                            |
| 26:10      | And I didn't even look if you can convert to stone.                                               |
| 26:13      | I'm gonna have to check that after we finish recording.                                           |
| 26:15      | But you can do all sorts of unit conversions.                                                     |
| 26:18      | Like one of the things I made in the 1.1 update                                                   |
| 26:21      | is I made a temperature conversion.                                                               |
| 26:23      | Like you can go between Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.                                           |
| 26:27      | And it's just simple calculations,                                                                |
| 26:29      | but it's nice being able to now incorporate that                                                  |
| 26:32      | into your shortcuts.                                                                              |
| 26:35      | And the conversions are on all sorts of different units.                                          |
| 26:39      | And it's really nice to now be able,                                                              |
| 26:41      | once again, do that without API calls                                                             |
| 26:43      | and making it more complicated.                                                                   |
| 26:45      | I guess the overall theme of all of these updates                                                 |
| 26:47      | is they're looking at a lot of the friction points                                                |
| 26:50      | and trying to sand those down a bit.                                                              |
| 26:51      | Definitely, yes.                                                                                  |
| 26:52      | And real-time feedback,                                                                           |
| 26:54      | you can indeed convert your weight.                                                               |
| 26:55      | It's under mass, not weight.                                                                      |
| 26:57      | So if you're looking to convert measurement,                                                      |
| 26:59      | you're looking for mass,                                                                          |
| 27:00      | and you can convert from pounds to stone,                                                         |
| 27:02      | or if you really wanna make yourself feel like David,                                             |
| 27:05      | how about tons?                                                                                   |
| 27:06      | Yeah, there you go.                                                                               |
| 27:08      | There you go.                                                                                     |
| 27:08      | You can be a very small weight of a ton.                                                          |
| 27:11      | And that's a very small number.                                                                   |
| 27:14      | There we go.                                                                                      |
| 27:14      | I feel better.                                                                                    |
| 27:15      | I already feel better.                                                                            |
| 27:16      | Hey, that's what it's all about.                                                                  |
| 27:19      | So that's one update that's already out.                                                          |
| 27:22      | There's more, there's more.                                                                       |
| 27:24      | Yeah, okay.                                                                                       |
| 27:25      | There's a loud sharing of shortcuts which we've been doing                                        |
| 27:27      | off the show for a while now.                                                                     |
| 27:28      | Oh, yes, of course.                                                                               |
| 27:29      | That came out with the 1.1.                                                                       |
| 27:32      | And then I wanna talk quickly about shortcut syncing.                                             |
| 27:35      | Oh, yes.                                                                                          |
| 27:36      | As the app launched, it was horrible.                                                             |
| 27:38      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                         |
| 27:39      | For me, it has,                                                                                   |
| 27:40      | and I believe this was with the 1.1 update,                                                       |
| 27:42      | it has really sorted itself out.                                                                  |
| 27:44      | I've got an iPad and an iPhone and my shortcuts just sync.                                        |
| 27:49      | I've not had a critical failure on that.                                                          |
| 27:52      | I'm knocking on wood as I record this.                                                            |
| 27:55      | I had initially in the [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] field guide a video                                       |
| 27:58      | where I did nothing but make fun of syncing                                                       |
| 28:00      | because it was so bad.                                                                            |
| 28:01      | And now I had to replace that with one                                                            |
| 28:03      | where I show you how it works now because it works.                                               |
| 28:05      | But then I hear stories.                                                                          |
| 28:07      | I think Rose, you told me in Chicago                                                              |
| 28:08      | that you lost all your shortcuts.                                                                 |
| 28:11      | I didn't lose all of my shortcuts.                                                                |
| 28:12      | I lost 493 shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 28:15      | How what?                                                                                         |
| 28:17      | How did that happen?                                                                              |
| 28:18      | So essentially my syncing was broken.                                                             |
| 28:21      | Now I should highlight to all of our listeners,                                                   |
| 28:24      | I use beta software.                                                                              |
| 28:25      | I use beta operating systems.                                                                     |
| 28:27      | My life is a beta.                                                                                |
| 28:29      | And this means instability.                                                                       |
| 28:32      | And I am very aware of this.                                                                      |
| 28:33      | And I am pretty certain that all of my problems came down                                         |
| 28:36      | to the number of betas that were running                                                          |
| 28:38      | and the fact that nothing was quite working                                                       |
| 28:40      | as it was supposed to.                                                                            |
| 28:42      | So I took a nuclear approach, not completely nuclear,                                             |
| 28:46      | but I turned off iCloud syncing in the settings.                                                  |
| 28:50      | So in settings under shortcuts,                                                                   |
| 28:51      | you can disable and enable the syncing                                                            |
| 28:54      | of the order of shortcuts                                                                         |
| 28:56      | and the syncing of shortcuts themselves.                                                          |
| 28:58      | So I turned this off on all of my devices.                                                        |
| 29:00      | I uninstalled shortcuts from all of my devices                                                    |
| 29:03      | and I reinstalled shortcuts on all of my devices.                                                 |
| 29:06      | Now, before I uninstalled, I backed up my shortcuts.                                              |
| 29:09      | And if you're going to do this,                                                                   |
| 29:10      | please, please, please, please, please                                                            |
| 29:12      | back up your shortcuts.                                                                           |
| 29:13      | Because the last thing you want to do                                                             |
| 29:14      | is lose something that you spent time working on                                                  |
| 29:17      | or just which version of this shortcut                                                            |
| 29:19      | was it that I was using.                                                                          |
| 29:20      | In some cases, that's very hard to find out,                                                      |
| 29:23      | especially with something like a toggle time tracking shortcut,                                   |
| 29:26      | which of the eight billion ones was it?                                                           |
| 29:28      | So I backed everything up and I ran a,                                                            |
| 29:31      | I'll include my backup shortcut in the show notes.                                                |
| 29:36      | And so I backed everything up and it told me of that I had,                                       |
| 29:40      | I can't even remember how many shortcuts I had now.                                               |
| 29:42      | I think it was 1,016 on my iPhone                                                                 |
| 29:44      | and I had less on my iPad and I already knew this.                                                |
| 29:48      | And then I reinstalled it and I had zero shortcuts,                                               |
| 29:54      | which was slightly terrifying to start with.                                                      |
| 29:56      | And then I thought, you know what, I'm just gonna go away,                                        |
| 29:59      | gonna go eat some chocolate,                                                                      |
| 30:00      | gonna watch an episode of Star Trek and I'll come back.                                           |
| 30:03      | And after my episode of Star Trek,                                                                |
| 30:05      | I'm very pleased to report                                                                        |
| 30:06      | that 50% of my shortcuts are pretend.                                                             |
| 30:09      | And for the other 50%, I know which ones they are                                                 |
| 30:12      | because again, I did a backup                                                                     |
| 30:15      | and I created a shortcut, which is called                                                         |
| 30:18      | install missing shortcut.                                                                         |
| 30:20      | I didn't just panic replace everything that was missing                                           |
| 30:23      | because I know I need to clean out my shortcuts.                                                  |
| 30:26      | I still have about 800, I think,                                                                  |
| 30:29      | because there was stuff wasn't syncing properly                                                   |
| 30:31      | and it wasn't lining up between devices.                                                          |
| 30:34      | And there was an equal risk there                                                                 |
| 30:36      | that you were gonna end up with two of every shortcut,                                            |
| 30:38      | you know, right?                                                                                  |
| 30:39      | Exactly, it could have been terrible.                                                             |
| 30:40      | So I'm quite glad that I ended up with less than planned.                                         |
| 30:43      | And then as I've got this install missing shortcut                                                |
| 30:45      | and it just gives me the option to search                                                         |
| 30:48      | and I do, I make myself search                                                                    |
| 30:50      | that I don't just scroll through a list                                                           |
| 30:52      | of all of the shortcuts that I previously had on my phone,                                        |
| 30:54      | I have to type in a keyword to search for it.                                                     |
| 30:58      | And then it will present me with the option                                                       |
| 30:59      | to install that shortcut.                                                                         |
| 31:01      | I have to choose one                                                                              |
| 31:01      | and then I'll install the shortcut,                                                               |
| 31:03      | install the missing shortcut.                                                                     |
| 31:04      | And I can provide all of these in the show notes.                                                 |
| 31:07      | And that's worked quite well                                                                      |
| 31:08      | because I have got less shortcuts                                                                 |
| 31:10      | than I started with, not by many,                                                                 |
| 31:12      | but my sync is working perfectly.                                                                 |
| 31:15      | So the payoff was 110% worth it.                                                                  |
| 31:19      | Just for being out there,                                                                         |
| 31:20      | how do you back up your shortcuts?                                                                |
| 31:23      | Very simple.                                                                                      |
| 31:24      | I had a shortcut which had,                                                                       |
| 31:26      | the first action was get shortcuts                                                                |
| 31:28      | and then the second action was save files.                                                        |
| 31:32      | So I just saved them and I put,                                                                   |
| 31:34      | so I did one different folder per device                                                          |
| 31:37      | that I had the shortcuts on.                                                                      |
| 31:39      | So I had backup slash iPhone XS Max                                                               |
| 31:43      | and backup slash iPhone 11-inch iPad Pro.                                                         |
| 31:48      | So I knew which ones had come from which devices                                                  |
| 31:50      | because also I knew all my iPads,                                                                 |
| 31:52      | some of them were out of date                                                                     |
| 31:53      | because they had synced                                                                           |
| 31:55      | and then they stopped syncing for whatever reason,                                                |
| 31:58      | which is why I took the approach that I did                                                       |
| 32:00      | of uninstalling everything and reinstalling everything                                            |
| 32:02      | and crossing my fingers and hoping for the best.                                                  |
| 32:04      | And it did work out.                                                                              |
| 32:05      | And you can just save them to your iCloud account.                                                |
| 32:07      | It's not difficult.                                                                               |
| 32:08      | Exactly.                                                                                          |
| 32:09      | I saved them into iCloud.                                                                         |
| 32:11      | These are not big files.                                                                          |
| 32:12      | They don't take up masses of space.                                                               |
| 32:15      | And they're all backed up.                                                                        |
| 32:17      | And whenever I find that I'm missing one,                                                         |
| 32:19      | then I restore it.                                                                                |
| 32:20      | In some cases, I found that I had ancient versions                                                |
| 32:23      | of them lying around.                                                                             |
| 32:24      | So clearly when things got stuck,                                                                 |
| 32:25      | the state that they were in on my iPad                                                            |
| 32:28      | was the state that the iCloud thought that they were in,                                          |
| 32:32      | but reinstalling has fixed all of my syncing woes.                                                |
| 32:35      | So if you have got the latest updates                                                             |
| 32:37      | and you're having syncing issues,                                                                 |
| 32:39      | I will write up my entire backup process                                                          |
| 32:42      | and how I did everything in the posts                                                             |
| 32:44      | that accompanies this show so that you can,                                                       |
| 32:47      | as you can also hopefully restore your syncing                                                    |
| 32:52      | to the state it should be in.                                                                     |
| 32:53      | Yeah, and that's probably not a bad idea.                                                         |
| 32:55      | No matter how many shortcuts you have,                                                            |
| 32:56      | if you spent any time making them,                                                                |
| 32:57      | just go ahead and run a backup occasionally                                                       |
| 33:00      | and put them in there.                                                                            |
| 33:02      | I've got like about 200.                                                                          |
| 33:04      | I think I have, I prune my shortcuts more often than you.                                         |
| 33:09      | I'll make them and kill them often.                                                               |
| 33:11      | And if I'm not using them, I just don't keep them around.                                         |
| 33:14      | But I think maybe part of the reason                                                              |
| 33:16      | was just the number you had,                                                                      |
| 33:18      | but also you've been running betas and,                                                           |
| 33:19      | but I mean, so have I.                                                                            |
| 33:20      | And it was a mess for a while.                                                                    |
| 33:24      | So I'm sure there was just some craft leftover.                                                   |
| 33:26      | Yeah, I think it's one of these things.                                                           |
| 33:28      | At one point in the beta,                                                                         |
| 33:29      | like to start with when shortcuts beta launched,                                                  |
| 33:32      | they did not have the syncing turned on                                                           |
| 33:37      | and then it was turned on.                                                                        |
| 33:39      | But I think at that point,                                                                        |
| 33:40      | I was away from one of my iPads that I had then.                                                  |
| 33:42      | So that confused things                                                                           |
| 33:44      | and it made everything get a little bit messed up.                                                |
| 33:47      | And yes, that's just what happens when you run betas,                                             |
| 33:50      | but I accepted that risk when I joined the beta, so.                                              |
| 33:54      | All right, well, there you have it.                                                               |
| 33:56      | Back up your stuff, gang.                                                                         |
| 33:57      | But overall, I would say that it's much more stable now                                           |
| 34:00      | and it is actually works.                                                                         |
| 34:02      | Like for instance, I keep a lot of, you know,                                                     |
| 34:04      | a lot of my, we're going to talk later                                                            |
| 34:06      | about what we'd like in the future,                                                               |
| 34:07      | but for now there's no folder structure.                                                          |
| 34:09      | So I use colour coding to keep like, you know,                                                     |
| 34:12      | the OmniFocus stuff is purple                                                                     |
| 34:14      | and the time tracking stuff is orange.                                                            |
| 34:16      | And you know, I just got away.                                                                    |
| 34:17      | So when I scroll through it,                                                                      |
| 34:18      | I can get to what I want quickly.                                                                 |
| 34:20      | And all those orders now are being honoured across the system,                                     |
| 34:25      | but I'm not an extreme case.                                                                      |
| 34:27      | You know, I only have two devices, a phone and an iPad.                                           |
| 34:29      | And while I have a lot of shortcuts,                                                              |
| 34:32      | I don't have a Rosemary Orchard level.                                                            |
| 34:34      | I'm not into four digits.                                                                         |
| 34:37      | Well, I just double checked.                                                                      |
| 34:38      | And according to my iPhone, I have 493 shortcuts.                                                 |
| 34:43      | And I just deleted 10 untitled shortcuts                                                          |
| 34:46      | because I frequently don't name them,                                                             |
| 34:48      | which is my way of knowing that I should go back                                                  |
| 34:50      | and delete it later,                                                                              |
| 34:51      | which is something I like to do on the tram.                                                      |
| 34:53      | Yeah, it's when you're testing things, right?                                                     |
| 34:54      | I did the same thing. Yeah, exactly.                                                              |
| 34:56      | Or sometimes I do these to do one-off actions                                                     |
| 34:58      | because I don't need to keep this.                                                                |
| 35:01      | But at the time that I'm doing it,                                                                |
| 35:03      | the easiest way to result my issue is via shortcuts.                                              |
| 35:06      | So I just get on with it.                                                                         |
| 35:09      | All right, well, before we continue,                                                              |
| 35:10      | I want to talk about our sponsor.                                                                 |
| 35:11      | And that's our friends over at ExpressVPN.                                                        |

| 35:21      | So this episode is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                                  |
| 35:25      | We can probably all hold our hands up                                                             |
| 35:27      | and admit cybercrime is something we think happens                                                |
| 35:29      | to other people because who would want your data, right?                                          |
| 35:34      | You know, it's like, I don't have anything to lose.                                               |
| 35:36      | But the bad news is stealing data from people                                                     |
| 35:39      | like you and me using public Wi-Fi                                                                |
| 35:41      | is one of the simplest ways for hackers to make money.                                            |
| 35:44      | And the way they do that is they go into Starbucks                                                |
| 35:47      | and they set up some kind of fake Wi-Fi signal,                                                   |
| 35:51      | where you can use their Wi-Fi and they're detecting                                               |
| 35:54      | your traffic as it goes through.                                                                  |
| 35:55      | They get all the ones and zeros.                                                                  |
| 35:56      | They get your data out of your email.                                                             |
| 35:58      | And once they get into your email, then that's game over.                                         |
| 36:01      | So if you leave your internet connection unencrypted,                                             |
| 36:03      | your passwords and credit card numbers are vulnerable.                                            |
| 36:06      | But there's something you can do to protect yourself                                              |
| 36:08      | from cybercriminals and that's to start using a VPN.                                              |
| 36:12      | And ExpressVPN is the one we recommend.                                                           |
| 36:15      | ExpressVPN works by securing and anonymising                                                      |
| 36:18      | your internet browsing.                                                                           |
| 36:19      | It encrypts your data and hides your public IP address                                            |
| 36:23      | with easy to use apps that run seamlessly                                                         |
| 36:25      | in the background of your device.                                                                 |
| 36:27      | I was in Chicago for several days,                                                                |
| 36:29      | spent a lot of time and places that had public Wi-Fi.                                             |
| 36:32      | All I had to do with ExpressVPN is open the app                                                   |
| 36:35      | and press one button.                                                                             |
| 36:36      | You just press one button and then you're safe and secure.                                        |
| 36:41      | So you can turn on ExpressVPN with the click                                                      |
| 36:44      | and then you're free to safely surf on public Wi-Fi                                               |
| 36:47      | without being snooped on or having your personal data stolen.                                     |
| 36:50      | ExpressVPN is rated the number one VPN service                                                    |
| 36:53      | by tech radar.                                                                                    |
| 36:55      | It even comes with a 30 day money back guarantee.                                                 |
| 36:59      | Like I said, when I was in Chicago,                                                               |
| 37:00      | this was just super useful to me,                                                                 |
| 37:02      | but I have had a VPN service for a long time                                                      |
| 37:05      | and I love having ExpressVPN all the time                                                         |
| 37:07      | when I go to places that have open Wi-Fi.                                                         |
| 37:10      | Starbucks is a good example.                                                                      |
| 37:12      | A lot of mornings I spend there getting some work done.                                           |
| 37:15      | I never connect to their Wi-Fi                                                                    |
| 37:16      | without having ExpressVPN turned on.                                                              |
| 37:20      | So for less than $7 a month,                                                                      |
| 37:22      | you can get the same ExpressVPN protection that I have.                                           |
| 37:26      | If you ever use public Wi-Fi                                                                      |
| 37:28      | and want to keep the bad guys away from your data,                                                |
| 37:30      | you need ExpressVPN.                                                                              |

| 38:01      | So we've got some new stuff coming, Rose.                                                         |
| 38:03      | Both of us are on the beta                                                                        |
| 38:04      | and we're hoping that by the time the show airs,                                                  |
| 38:07      | it'll be out.                                                                                     |
| 38:08      | But if not, I'm sure it's not far off.                                                            |
| 38:09      | Let's talk about the goodies that are coming.                                                     |
| 38:12      | Oh, yes, and boy, oh boy, these are good ones.                                                    |
| 38:16      | So people who've listened to my power users                                                       |
| 38:18      | may or may not be aware of David's love                                                           |
| 38:21      | of note-taking applications.                                                                      |
| 38:24      | Well, did this cause you to switch?                                                               |
| 38:26      | Love is one word.                                                                                 |
| 38:28      | Did this shortcuts beta cause you to switch again, David?                                         |
| 38:31      | Yeah, well, you know, I just can never seem to be,                                                |
| 38:33      | I just can't get settled on a note-taking app.                                                    |
| 38:36      | You know, I want an app that I can just drop text into.                                           |
| 38:39      | And then when [[Apple]], and for the longest time, you know,                                          |
| 38:42      | I was using plain text apps for that, you know?                                                   |
| 38:44      | And, but when [[Apple]] did release the update to [[Apple]],                                              |
| 38:48      | notes, I have to admit, I like the ability to add photos                                          |
| 38:52      | and other sorts of metadata to the notes app.                                                     |
| 38:55      | It's kind of like a simplified version of Evernote,                                               |
| 38:59      | if that makes any sense, local to me on my system.                                                |
| 39:02      | So I used it that way for several years.                                                          |
| 39:05      | Last year, I did an extended experiment with Bear,                                                |
| 39:10      | which is another note-taking app out there,                                                       |
| 39:12      | very markdown friendly.                                                                           |
| 39:15      | It does allow you to put metadata in                                                              |
| 39:17      | and it is super automation friendly.                                                              |
| 39:19      | It, I mean, there's so much you can do                                                            |
| 39:22      | through Siri shortcuts with Bear                                                                  |
| 39:24      | that you cannot do with [[Apple Notes]].                                                              |
| 39:26      | But frankly, I found that I wasn't really doing                                                   |
| 39:28      | much of that automation.                                                                          |
| 39:29      | And I don't really like the way Bear displays the text                                            |
| 39:34      | cause it puts all the markdown like syntax on the page                                            |
| 39:39      | where I don't really need it.                                                                     |
| 39:40      | I understand Markdown, I wrote a book about it.                                                   |
| 39:42      | I don't need to see like the hashes for the headings                                              |
| 39:45      | and things like that.                                                                             |
| 39:46      | So ultimately I've decided I'm just gonna stick                                                   |
| 39:49      | with notes for now.                                                                               |
| 39:50      | And as I was making that decision, I got this beta                                                |
| 39:53      | and they said, oh, by the way,                                                                    |
| 39:54      | Siri shortcuts now supports [[Apple Notes]].                                                          |
| 39:56      | So it's kind of like a couple of things happening at once,                                        |
| 39:59      | but yay, we get Apple Note,                                                                       |
| 40:01      | or at least a basic level of Apple Note support                                                   |
| 40:03      | through Siri shortcuts now.                                                                       |
| 40:05      | Yeah, I mean, we always had the ability                                                           |
| 40:06      | to create notes in [[Apple Notes]], but that was kind of it.                                          |
| 40:09      | It was this one way entry into a black hole                                                       |
| 40:13      | and you were stuck with it.                                                                       |
| 40:15      | But now you can find notes and then once you found it,                                            |
| 40:19      | you can append to it or you can show it,                                                          |
| 40:22      | which is really actually surprisingly useful.                                                     |
| 40:25      | So for example, we have a shared note for the show                                                |
| 40:27      | where we store topic ideas.                                                                       |
| 40:30      | We do the individual show notes in Quip                                                           |
| 40:32      | where we do all of our planning and everything                                                    |
| 40:33      | because that's very good for collaboration                                                        |
| 40:36      | and tends to support iOS faster than Google does                                                  |
| 40:40      | when it comes to new devices and new operating system features.                                   |
| 40:44      | But this means that we can now use shortcuts                                                      |
| 40:48      | to just append an idea to our topic ideas note,                                                   |
| 40:53      | which is fabulous and I'm very excited by that.                                                   |
| 40:56      | Yeah, the appended text is,                                                                       |
| 40:57      | I think, the most interesting new feature.                                                        |
| 40:59      | So if you have any sort of running list note,                                                     |
| 41:02      | you can use it for this.                                                                          |
| 41:04      | I've got a couple things I've been doing with it.                                                 |
| 41:07      | And if you want to try dictation,                                                                 |
| 41:10      | I think this is a fun one to do it.                                                               |
| 41:11      | I created a shortcut where it prompts me to dictate text                                          |
| 41:15      | and then it just depends it to an Apple note.                                                     |
| 41:18      | So on some of my running things                                                                   |
| 41:19      | where I get off the phone with a person                                                           |
| 41:20      | and I've got a note where I'm tracking the stuff                                                  |
| 41:23      | we're working on that project,                                                                    |
| 41:25      | I can just quickly create an entry                                                                |
| 41:27      | without even going on [[Apple Notes]] and just using my voice.                                        |
| 41:29      | And that kind of stuff, I think, is really a nice addition.                                       |
| 41:33      | Yes, and I would make a point here.                                                               |
| 41:37      | There are some people who are used to using things                                                |
| 41:39      | like [[Drafts]] or bear will know                                                                     |
| 41:42      | that usually you can just use the ID of the note                                                  |
| 41:44      | to append to it and you can get that ID                                                           |
| 41:46      | from bear or from [[Drafts]] or from Ulysses.                                                         |
| 41:51      | Shortcuts and notes don't have that kind of relationship.                                         |
| 41:55      | Notes is a little bit more closed off about things like this.                                     |
| 41:59      | It's a little more British, perhaps.                                                              |
| 42:00      | And instead, it makes you search and say,                                                         |
| 42:03      | you need to use the find notes where                                                              |
| 42:06      | application to then get the note that you want                                                    |
| 42:10      | so that you can append to that note.                                                              |
| 42:13      | Also, you can show that note,                                                                     |
| 42:15      | which is a minor limitation,                                                                      |
| 42:17      | which I'm very happy with                                                                         |
| 42:18      | because it just adds one extra action                                                             |
| 42:20      | because you can actually specify, for example,                                                    |
| 42:23      | name contains or name matches, and then you can limit it.                                         |
| 42:27      | So I have, for example, exactly one note                                                          |
| 42:32      | with automated show notes ideas, or show ideas, sorry.                                            |
| 42:36      | And I know that I've only got one,                                                                |
| 42:39      | so I've limited that to one,                                                                      |
| 42:41      | so I only ever get one note back from that search.                                                |
| 42:43      | Yeah, I do feel like it's a little bit of a let down, though,                                     |
| 42:47      | because the way Ulysses and Bear does it                                                          |
| 42:49      | is there's actually a specific ID attached                                                        |
| 42:52      | to every record that you create, and that is certainty, right?                                    |
| 42:56      | The way you get around it with this new thing,                                                    |
| 42:59      | with shortcuts, with notes, is you search for it,                                                 |
| 43:02      | but what if, for whatever reason,                                                                 |
| 43:04      | what if you accidentally duplicate that note,                                                     |
| 43:06      | and you have two with the same name?                                                              |
| 43:08      | Yes.                                                                                              |
| 43:09      | All of a sudden, you added uncertainty to the process,                                            |
| 43:12      | and I do like the idea of a specific ID                                                           |
| 43:15      | for specific locations, but what are you going to do?                                             |
| 43:18      | I will note, if you add choose from list                                                          |
| 43:21      | under the find notes where action,                                                                |
| 43:23      | then you can, of course, choose,                                                                  |
| 43:25      | and you can, of course, make this a little bit more complicated                                   |
| 43:28      | by doing a count.                                                                                 |
| 43:29      | If count equals one, then just get that item,                                                     |
| 43:33      | otherwise, get items choose from list.                                                            |
| 43:35      | Oh, that's clever, Rose.                                                                          |
| 43:37      | That was a good one.                                                                              |
| 43:38      | I didn't think of that, so the idea there is,                                                     |
| 43:40      | if the results get you just one result,                                                           |
| 43:43      | then, okay, just go ahead and drop it in,                                                         |
| 43:45      | but if it gets you two, let the user choose.                                                      |
| 43:47      | More than one, yeah.                                                                              |
| 43:48      | Yeah, make you choose, yeah.                                                                      |
| 43:50      | Which is a way around it, but then you're adding,                                                 |
| 43:52      | well, at least on my iPhone XS Max,                                                               |
| 43:54      | that's the screen's worth of actions.                                                             |
| 43:56      | However, because this is shortcuts,                                                               |
| 43:59      | what you can, of course, do is you can put that                                                   |
| 44:02      | in a shortcut, which is, and just call it something                                               |
| 44:05      | like handle multiple notes,                                                                       |
| 44:07      | and then just add, after the find notes where,                                                    |
| 44:10      | add, run, shortcut, handle multiple notes,                                                        |
| 44:13      | and then if there are multiples, it will make you choose,                                         |
| 44:17      | otherwise, it will just send the one back,                                                        |
| 44:19      | and you only ever have to add that one action,                                                    |
| 44:21      | and then you can handle that in multiple places as well.                                          |
| 44:23      | Yeah, and that's something we haven't talked about much here,                                     |
| 44:25      | but you can certainly create subroutines of [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]],                                     |
| 44:29      | and we're getting very programmary at this point,                                                 |
| 44:31      | but if you do something repeatedly and you have,                                                  |
| 44:34      | like, that workflow of choosing between multiples                                                 |
| 44:37      | and you're gonna make a bunch of different shortcuts                                              |
| 44:39      | that relate to [[Apple Notes]],                                                                       |
| 44:41      | why not make it a subroutine that you just drop in                                                |
| 44:44      | with the run shortcut command,                                                                    |
| 44:46      | rather than having to create it from scratch every time?                                          |
| 44:48      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                 |
| 44:50      | And, I mean, we did talk about subroutines a little                                               |
| 44:52      | on the Shortcuts Home Screen episode,                                                             |
| 44:54      | which we will, of course, link to in the show notes                                               |
| 44:56      | for more details.                                                                                 |
| 44:58      | All right, so we've got more notes. That's great.                                                 |
| 45:01      | Also, maps and directions are gonna get better with 2.2.                                          |
| 45:06      | Yeah, and so if you are in China, I believe,                                                      |
| 45:09      | then Show Directions now supports Baidu Maps,                                                     |
| 45:11      | which I have probably said correctly,                                                             |
| 45:13      | and it's probably not even China,                                                                 |
| 45:15      | because I'm having one of those days.                                                             |
| 45:17      | But yes, so there's support for an extra provider.                                                |
| 45:20      | But my favourite one here is the travel time.                                                      |
| 45:23      | So get travel time turns so much more information now.                                            |
| 45:27      | So you no longer have to get the amount of time                                                   |
| 45:29      | that your travel time is going to take                                                            |
| 45:31      | and get the current date and time and calculate                                                   |
| 45:33      | and adjust that.                                                                                  |
| 45:35      | You can just get the arrival time,                                                                |
| 45:37      | which saves so many actions when you need it.                                                     |
| 45:41      | So I'm a big fan of that.                                                                         |
| 45:43      | Well, I think they probably saw how many people                                                   |
| 45:46      | were running subroutines like that with the numbers                                               |
| 45:49      | and realised, let's make this easier.                                                             |
| 45:51      | And let me just say, I had to look up Baidu Maps.                                                 |
| 45:55      | It is super cool.                                                                                 |
| 45:57      | I wish we had those in the United States.                                                         |
| 45:59      | It's like a SimCity render of your city.                                                          |
| 46:03      | It's cool.                                                                                        |
| 46:05      | I wish we had those.                                                                              |
| 46:07      | But yeah, so Maps and Directions are going to get easier.                                         |
| 46:10      | Not only does it give you a arrival time,                                                         |
| 46:12      | it gives you distance and route name.                                                             |
| 46:14      | So it's like, you can give a much more detail.                                                    |
| 46:17      | You know, everybody has that series shortcut                                                      |
| 46:19      | that tells their spouse what time they'll be home.                                                |
| 46:21      | That just got a lot easier.                                                                       |
| 46:23      | Yes, and if you don't have one,                                                                   |
| 46:25      | yes, it's your homework challenge.                                                                |
| 46:27      | Make one. Make one to tell yourself                                                               |
| 46:29      | when you're going to get home as well,                                                            |
| 46:31      | because on my way home from work,                                                                 |
| 46:33      | I'm there going, so when am I going to get home                                                   |
| 46:35      | trying to plan things out?                                                                        |
| 46:37      | And if I miscalculate when I'm going to be home,                                                  |
| 46:39      | that throws off my entire routine.                                                                |
| 46:41      | Because I'll get home 10 minutes later than I thought                                             |
| 46:43      | and go, oh, well, now I don't have time to do the laundry.                                        |
| 46:46      | Or I get home 10 minutes earlier.                                                                 |
| 46:48      | That's the worst.                                                                                 |
| 46:50      | If you get home earlier than you think                                                            |
| 46:52      | and you've said, boy, I've got 10 minutes to sit on the sofa.                                     |
| 46:55      | That's the most dangerous 10 minutes                                                              |
| 46:57      | you can possibly have in your take.                                                               |
| 46:59      | So it derails me every single time.                                                               |
| 47:01      | I can sit on the sofa for 10 minutes                                                              |
| 47:03      | and four hours later, I haven't moved,                                                            |
| 47:05      | but I have watched four episodes of elementary.                                                   |
| 47:07      | I've got this image of you standing outside your house,                                           |
| 47:09      | just looking at your watch.                                                                       |
| 47:11      | No, I'm not going in early. This isn't going to work.                                             |
| 47:13      | Take a walk.                                                                                      |
| 47:15      | I should do that, actually,                                                                       |
| 47:17      | if I get home earlier than planned.                                                               |
| 47:19      | But I don't need to do that anymore,                                                              |
| 47:21      | so I'm going to get home, which is usually off by a few minutes                                   |
| 47:23      | because I take public transport and walk,                                                         |
| 47:25      | and there's no public transit spot for Vienna.                                                    |
| 47:27      | But that's such a point.                                                                          |
| 47:30      | The dictionary values is another thing that I think                                               |
| 47:33      | it's kind of like an intermediate level                                                           |
| 47:35      | series shortcut skill that a lot of people start to pick up.                                      |
| 47:38      | Now you can go into the dictionary                                                                |
| 47:41      | and they've just made everything easier                                                           |
| 47:43      | and more accessible with this.                                                                    |
| 47:45      | This is probably my favourite part of the 2.2 update, really.                                      |
| 47:48      | Yes.                                                                                              |
| 47:50      | Well, this is possibly my second favourite part.                                                   |
| 47:52      | So essentially, the get dictionary value,                                                         |
| 47:54      | you can now get nested values.                                                                    |
| 47:57      | So you can go down four or five levels                                                            |
| 47:59      | without having to do get dictionary value                                                         |
| 48:01      | four or five times,                                                                               |
| 48:03      | and you just combine these with a single dot.                                                     |
| 48:06      | So this is a full stop or a period,                                                               |
| 48:08      | as the Americans call it.                                                                         |
| 48:10      | And you just do, so,                                                                              |
| 48:12      | key.key.key,                                                                                      |
| 48:14      | and then you've got whatever is under                                                             |
| 48:16      | key.key.key,                                                                                      |
| 48:18      | which makes getting deep down into                                                                |
| 48:21      | some of these things much faster,                                                                 |
| 48:23      | because I know, for example,                                                                      |
| 48:25      | my work time tracking shortcut,                                                                   |
| 48:27      | I have to go five levels down into a dictionary,                                                  |
| 48:30      | which is five actions.                                                                            |
| 48:33      | But I only need one act of one value                                                              |
| 48:36      | right at the bottom of that.                                                                      |
| 48:38      | So guess what? I've just condensed all of that into one.                                          |
| 48:40      | And boy, oh boy, does that make my life easier.                                                   |
| 48:43      | Rose, at what point do you feel like                                                              |
| 48:46      | it makes sense to add a dictionary to a shortcut?                                                 |
| 48:50      | Well, so this is where the difference between lists                                               |
| 48:53      | and menus and dictionaries comes into play.                                                       |
| 48:55      | And I've got a blog post on this. I'll make sure to link it.                                      |
| 48:57      | It was written for workflow,                                                                      |
| 48:59      | but the theory behind it has not changed at all.                                                  |
| 49:02      | So a list gives you what you choose.                                                              |
| 49:05      | Okay, so if you've got a list of carrots,                                                         |
| 49:08      | tomatoes, and bananas,                                                                            |
| 49:10      | and you choose bananas, you get bananas.                                                          |
| 49:12      | Or like the one I did earlier today                                                               |
| 49:14      | or want the weather for today or tomorrow.                                                        |
| 49:16      | Exactly.                                                                                          |
| 49:18      | Yes, so assuming that's a list, then yes.                                                         |
| 49:21      | Choose today, get today, choose tomorrow, get tomorrow.                                           |
| 49:24      | And lists in shortcuts are words.                                                                 |
| 49:27      | A dictionary is, if I say bananas,                                                                |
| 49:31      | give me fruit.                                                                                    |
| 49:33      | If I say tomatoes,                                                                                |
| 49:35      | give me fruits that people think are vegetables.                                                  |
| 49:38      | And if I say carrots, give me vegetables,                                                         |
| 49:40      | or root vegetables, if I'm being very precise.                                                    |
| 49:43      | And then a menu is, if I say today,                                                               |
| 49:47      | give me today's weather.                                                                          |
| 49:49      | Because I don't really want the word today.                                                       |
| 49:51      | I want today's weather.                                                                           |
| 49:52      | And if I say tomorrow, give me tomorrow's weather.                                                |
| 49:55      | And so a list gives you text.                                                                     |
| 49:57      | And a dictionary can give you text                                                                |
| 49:59      | or it can give you a list of items.                                                               |
| 50:01      | It can give you all sorts of things back.                                                         |
| 50:03      | That's where dictionaries can get quite complicated.                                              |
| 50:05      | And a menu gives you actions.                                                                     |
| 50:07      | And it does not give you the text that you've chosen.                                             |
| 50:09      | So you can call it whatever you like.                                                             |
| 50:11      | You can call it the summarised emoji if you want.                                                 |
| 50:13      | But it gives you whatever is inside that menu item.                                               |
| 50:16      | Because for starters, confession here,                                                            |
| 50:19      | when I was first using workflow,                                                                  |
| 50:21      | I didn't realise that lists existed.                                                              |
| 50:23      | So I had this really complicated system of a very long menu.                                      |
| 50:26      | And inside of every menu entry was a text box                                                     |
| 50:29      | with the same text as was in the menu.                                                            |
| 50:32      | Which was perhaps one of the least efficient shortcuts                                            |
| 50:36      | I've ever created.                                                                                |
| 50:37      | But it was great fun and a really good way to learn.                                              |
| 50:39      | And honestly, when they first started,                                                            |
| 50:41      | that stuff was dropping in like every week.                                                       |
| 50:43      | So it's a possible when you started, they didn't have a list.                                     |
| 50:46      | Quite possibly. I don't know.                                                                     |
| 50:48      | I have a feeling at that point I wasn't really paying attention.                                  |
| 50:51      | I was just there going, well, this seems really cool.                                             |
| 50:53      | I should play with it.                                                                            |
| 50:54      | Why am I not getting the text back that I've chosen from my menu?                                 |
| 50:57      | Oh, this is complicated.                                                                          |
| 50:58      | I'll just put text boxes in.                                                                      |
| 51:00      | And here we are today, running automators.                                                        |
| 51:03      | I think it's very useful.                                                                         |
| 51:05      | And it's something that as you get further down                                                   |
| 51:07      | the series shortcut stack, you need to understand that                                            |
| 51:10      | and start putting those dictionaries into effect.                                                 |
| 51:12      | It's nice for more detailed shortcuts.                                                            |
| 51:16      | Some additional changes we've got coming up with 2.2.                                             |
| 51:19      | When you adjust date, you can get the start date of a week,                                       |
| 51:23      | which is kind of fun.                                                                             |
| 51:26      | What are some of the other things that are coming in 2.2?                                         |
| 51:29      | You can get numbers from input.                                                                   |
| 51:31      | Now, I'm just going to give you a little background                                               |
| 51:34      | on the get something from input.                                                                  |
| 51:36      | Because there are several.                                                                        |
| 51:37      | There's get text from input.                                                                      |
| 51:38      | There's get numbers from input.                                                                   |
| 51:39      | But essentially what this does,                                                                   |
| 51:41      | so if I have a sentence that says, buy 42 carats.                                                 |
| 51:46      | Don't ask me why I'm buying 42 carats                                                             |
| 51:48      | because I don't have a good reason.                                                               |
| 51:50      | But the 42 are numbers.                                                                           |
| 51:51      | That's good though.                                                                               |
| 51:52      | I like carats.                                                                                    |
| 51:53      | 42 is a good number.                                                                              |
| 51:54      | Maybe it should be spicy carats.                                                                  |
| 51:56      | But then if I get numbers from input,                                                             |
| 51:58      | if the 42 are in numbers,                                                                         |
| 52:00      | so the symbol for form 2,                                                                         |
| 52:03      | then it will get 42 out of this.                                                                  |
| 52:06      | And that's very useful                                                                            |
| 52:08      | because this will then just get those numbers.                                                    |
| 52:10      | Where as say for example,                                                                         |
| 52:12      | if I've got a web page and I do get text from input,                                              |
| 52:15      | it's going to get the text out of the web page for me.                                            |
| 52:18      | And text also includes numbers.                                                                   |
| 52:21      | These are not the kinds of variables                                                              |
| 52:24      | that we are used to as programmers perhaps.                                                       |
| 52:27      | But these are very useful for just getting                                                        |
| 52:29      | that specific information that you need from something.                                           |
| 52:32      | So for example, say if you are talking to an API                                                  |
| 52:36      | and it gives you the temperature with C or F at the end                                           |
| 52:41      | for Celsius and Fahrenheit.                                                                       |
| 52:43      | But you know that you're getting it back in Celsius                                               |
| 52:46      | and you actually want to do something and convert it somehow                                      |
| 52:50      | or I don't know, make a picture out of it,                                                        |
| 52:52      | which is of course possible in shortcuts                                                          |
| 52:53      | because you can do any of this.                                                                   |
| 52:55      | And you just want that 42.                                                                        |
| 52:59      | Then you can get the number from the input                                                        |
| 53:01      | and then it will just get that for you.                                                           |
| 53:03      | Yeah, and you know, just this is a programmery thing,                                              |
| 53:06      | but there's a string of text,                                                                     |
| 53:09      | which is just text like typing on your keyboard.                                                  |
| 53:13      | And there are numbers,                                                                            |
| 53:14      | which are numbers you can perform calculations on.                                                |
| 53:16      | You can have the number 42                                                                        |
| 53:19      | or you can have a text string that has a four and a two in it.                                    |
| 53:22      | And the computer or the phone might treat those differently                                       |
| 53:25      | and now you can actually grab them as a number.                                                   |
| 53:28      | Yeah, and that's very useful                                                                      |
| 53:30      | because it also means,                                                                            |
| 53:32      | and this is something that people find occasionally.                                              |
| 53:35      | So say for example, you've got an email with your work times                                      |
| 53:39      | and you just will get the times out of it.                                                        |
| 53:41      | Well, now you don't have to use regular expressions                                               |
| 53:43      | to try and match the numbers                                                                      |
| 53:45      | because you can get numbers from input                                                            |
| 53:47      | and that gives you all the numbers.                                                               |
| 53:49      | You'll have to figure out how to pair those up, of course.                                        |
| 53:51      | But you can get the numbers from input                                                            |
| 53:54      | and that will do exactly what you need.                                                           |
| 53:56      | Yeah, the other thing that's nice about this,                                                     |
| 53:58      | and I think this is the feature that Rose probably likes,                                         |
| 54:00      | just as much as I do, probably more.                                                              |
| 54:03      | I use the bottom of my shortcuts.                                                                 |
| 54:05      | This is like my lab area.                                                                         |
| 54:07      | I've always got a couple I'm working on down there                                                |
| 54:09      | and then I don't like drag them into the order until they're,                                     |
| 54:12      | you know, I'm happy with them and they made the team, I guess.                                    |
| 54:16      | But when you've got hundreds of these things                                                      |
| 54:19      | scrolling to the bottom text forever,                                                             |
| 54:21      | with this update, if you just tap the library button,                                             |
| 54:23      | it just jumps to the bottom.                                                                      |
| 54:25      | And that is a great feature.                                                                      |
| 54:27      | It's kind of silly, but it's a great feature.                                                     |
| 54:30      | Yes, this is apparently a day for Rose's confessions.                                             |
| 54:33      | When this feature was first announced,                                                            |
| 54:35      | I thought it wasn't working for me                                                                |
| 54:36      | because I kept tapping the library text at the top                                                |
| 54:39      | because I was expecting it to be near the clock icon                                              |
| 54:42      | because if you tap on the clock for people that don't know,                                       |
| 54:44      | you will scroll to the top.                                                                       |
| 54:46      | And this works in [[Safari]], this works in shortcuts,                                                |
| 54:49      | this works in pages, news, everything.                                                            |
| 54:52      | It's the library button at the bottom next to the gallery button.                                 |
| 54:55      | Yes. That's the one that you need to tap                                                          |
| 54:57      | to scroll to the bottom.                                                                          |
| 54:58      | And then, funnily enough, that is working for me.                                                 |
| 55:00      | It says library at the top, but that's not what you tap on.                                       |
| 55:03      | You tap on the little button with the four squares at the bottom.                                 |
| 55:07      | Which kind of makes sense because the top button                                                  |
| 55:09      | is so close to the go to the top button                                                           |
| 55:11      | that I could see some problems.                                                                   |
| 55:13      | That's the other thing because I thought that maybe                                               |
| 55:16      | the touch target was a little off on my phone,                                                    |
| 55:18      | so I was scrolling up a little bit.                                                               |
| 55:19      | And then, you know, when you scroll up,                                                           |
| 55:21      | it takes from the title from being the top left                                                   |
| 55:23      | to the top middle and makes it a bit smaller.                                                     |
| 55:25      | And I was tapping on that and scrolling back to the top                                           |
| 55:27      | and going, this is not working at all how it's supposed to.                                       |
| 55:30      | Do I need to file a radar on this or am I being very silly?                                       |
| 55:34      | And it turns out I was being very silly.                                                          |
| 55:36      | But that's okay. Everybody has silly days.                                                        |
| 55:38      | All right. Well, we've gone along, but I don't care.                                              |
| 55:40      | Let's talk a little bit about iOS 13                                                              |
| 55:43      | and the things we'd like to see show up with Siri shortcut.                                       |
| 55:46      | Since we're talking about updates,                                                                |
| 55:47      | I imagine 2.2 is going to be the last update                                                      |
| 55:50      | or we get what would presumably be 3.0 in June.                                                   |
| 55:55      | So there are a lot of things that I think, I mean, personally,                                    |
| 55:58      | I would classify these as a small enhancement.                                                    |
| 56:01      | That's from an end user perspective.                                                              |
| 56:03      | I know from a programming perspective,                                                            |
| 56:04      | these would not necessarily be small features                                                     |
| 56:06      | that they could do to still bring shortcuts                                                       |
| 56:09      | a lot further this year,                                                                          |
| 56:10      | but they wouldn't necessarily be 3.0 features                                                     |
| 56:14      | or gatekeepers as it were.                                                                        |
| 56:17      | And I'm sure you've got some of these as well, David.                                             |
| 56:19      | But I'm just going to go with some of them.                                                       |
| 56:22      | Because for example, the ask for input,                                                           |
| 56:24      | this is something I use all the time.                                                             |
| 56:26      | But every so often, not most of the time,                                                         |
| 56:28      | but every so often I want to run these shortcuts via Siri.                                        |
| 56:30      | Now, wouldn't it be great if ask for input would go,                                              |
| 56:33      | hey, I'm being run by Siri, I'm going to wait for dictation                                       |
| 56:36      | and I'm going to pause,                                                                           |
| 56:37      | I'm going to stop automatically when they pause                                                   |
| 56:39      | so that the shortcut continue.                                                                    |
| 56:41      | That for me would be killer feature.                                                              |
| 56:43      | Yeah, that opens up so many options                                                               |
| 56:45      | because there's so many shortcuts                                                                 |
| 56:47      | that do require some sort of input.                                                               |
| 56:49      | And even just like,                                                                               |
| 56:51      | if I could hang up the phone with a client                                                        |
| 56:53      | and say magic word Siri,                                                                          |
| 56:57      | set up new corporation project.                                                                   |
| 57:00      | And then suddenly as a lawyer,                                                                    |
| 57:02      | that's like one of the things I do and then say,                                                  |
| 57:04      | okay, what's the name of the company?                                                             |
| 57:06      | Who's the whatever,                                                                               |
| 57:07      | maybe just give me one input,                                                                     |
| 57:08      | even that would open up a bunch,                                                                  |
| 57:10      | but I'd like it if I could do two or three.                                                       |
| 57:12      | And then suddenly that just is in my OmniFocus database,                                          |
| 57:15      | the project is set up with the proper variables.                                                  |
| 57:18      | Just collection of variables through voice                                                        |
| 57:21      | is something that I think is obvious                                                              |
| 57:24      | and would make things work.                                                                       |
| 57:26      | I also think that honestly though,                                                                |
| 57:27      | just the HomePod experience needs to improve anyway.                                             |
| 57:31      | That's the one piece of Siri shortcuts                                                            |
| 57:33      | that still isn't entirely stable for me.                                                          |
| 57:35      | So maybe they need to nail that down.                                                             |
| 57:37      | Now I know, Rose,                                                                                 |
| 57:38      | you've got an article coming out                                                                  |
| 57:40      | with some of the things you wanted to do with iOS 13.                                             |
| 57:42      | So we'll, if that's out, we'll put that in the show notes                                         |
| 57:45      | and you dropped this on me just as we were starting to show.                                      |
| 57:48      | So I haven't really thought it through as much as you,                                            |
| 57:50      | but I can tell you some things I would like                                                       |
| 57:52      | with iOS 13 and Siri shortcuts                                                                    |
| 57:54      | is just to simplify the organisation and programming process.                                     |
| 57:58      | Oh yeah.                                                                                          |
| 57:59      | That would be key.                                                                                |
| 58:01      | Yeah, folders for the shortcuts would be nice.                                                    |
| 58:04      | And also just the fact that like when you do something that's tedious,                            |
| 58:08      | like in, like I think about something like [[Keyboard Maestro]],                                      |
| 58:11      | which is a similar paradigm,                                                                      |
| 58:13      | but it's very easy and [[Keyboard Maestro]] to select multiple items,                                 |
| 58:17      | you know, and copy and paste them.                                                                |
| 58:19      | And you can't do that on Siri shortcuts.                                                          |
| 58:21      | You have to go back to dragging every individual step in.                                         |
| 58:24      | And I think that is,                                                                              |
| 58:25      | that's a stumbling block for making longer shortcuts.                                             |
| 58:28      | Yes, it is.                                                                                       |
| 58:30      | And I mean, some of these things, you know,                                                       |
| 58:32      | it's going to be tricky.                                                                          |
| 58:34      | So I would love a Mac version of shortcuts,                                                       |
| 58:36      | but that is definitely a 3.0 feature.                                                             |
| 58:38      | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| 58:39      | Honestly, in some cases, I'd love the ability to edit this on a Mac,                              |
| 58:42      | not even run it, just view it and edit it.                                                        |
| 58:44      | Because I've got some shortcuts where even a 13 inch iPad screen                                  |
| 58:48      | is not going to cut it.                                                                           |
| 58:49      | It would be nice to plug it into a 27 inch screen                                                 |
| 58:51      | and, you know, see what my shortcut really looks like.                                            |
| 58:54      | And I know you can get the API data of a shortcut.                                                |
| 58:57      | You can edit these as XML files,                                                                  |
| 59:00      | but I don't like editing XML files.                                                               |
| 59:03      | I like pretty pictures.                                                                           |
| 59:05      | And that's what shortcuts is.                                                                     |
| 59:07      | That's a similar problem for me.                                                                  |
| 59:09      | And this goes back to like early days with workflow.                                              |
| 59:11      | I was on the beta and every time I see the guys from workflow,                                    |
| 59:15      | now Siri Shortcuts, and they always say,                                                          |
| 59:17      | well, what would you like improved?                                                               |
| 59:19      | One thing, it's just like an obvious thing for me                                                 |
| 59:21      | is the text field in Siri Shortcuts.                                                              |
| 59:24      | It's terrible.                                                                                    |
| 59:25      | It's like five or six lines.                                                                      |
| 59:27      | And, you know, if you have like,                                                                  |
| 59:29      | I have these shortcuts that run these complicated                                                 |
| 59:31      | OmniFocus creation scripts.                                                                       |
| 59:33      | And every time I go in there,                                                                     |
| 59:35      | I'm like, I'm diffusing a bomb, you know?                                                         |
| 59:37      | It's like, because if you get something wrong,                                                    |
| 59:39      | it screws up the entire shortcut                                                                  |
| 59:41      | and you can barely move in there.                                                                 |
| 59:43      | You have to have an iPad connected to a keyboard                                                  |
| 59:46      | at a minimum, but even then, there can be problems.                                               |
| 59:49      | So, like, so kind of that usability stuff                                                         |
| 59:51      | to create the more expanded uses.                                                                 |
| 59:53      | Like, if you hit the text box,                                                                    |
| 59:55      | why not just open to a full-size text window                                                      |
| 59:58      | or at least something more than a very tiny little                                                |
| 01:00:01   | text entry field that they have?                                                                  |
| 01:00:03   | Yeah, that would definitely be great.                                                             |
| 01:00:05   | I mean, if it only shows three or four lines                                                      |
| 01:00:08   | when you're scrolling through, that's fine.                                                       |
| 01:00:10   | But when I tap into it, if I've got a lot of text,                                                |
| 01:00:12   | it would be really nice if that opens up.                                                         |
| 01:00:14   | Though, I will mention, there are two ways I work around this.                                    |
| 01:00:17   | If it's text, I don't really edit that often,                                                     |
| 01:00:19   | and I just want to avoid myself messing it up.                                                    |
| 01:00:21   | I save it as a file, and then I get the file.                                                     |
| 01:00:24   | And I just store these in, I have a folder in Shortcuts                                           |
| 01:00:27   | called meta, because it's just stuff                                                              |
| 01:00:30   | that is retrieved by Shortcuts.                                                                   |
| 01:00:32   | This is also useful if I want to share information                                                |
| 01:00:34   | between multiple Shortcuts.                                                                       |
| 01:00:36   | Then the same template, for example,                                                              |
| 01:00:39   | can be called from multiple Shortcuts.                                                            |
| 01:00:41   | And in others, I use [[Drafts]].                                                                      |
| 01:00:43   | And I have a tag in [[Drafts]] called Shortcuts Text,                                                 |
| 01:00:47   | and a workspace that I can easily access this.                                                    |
| 01:00:51   | And then I get the contents of a draft,                                                           |
| 01:00:54   | because every draft has a universally unique ID.                                                  |
| 01:00:57   | And so you can just get the contents of a draft from that ID                                      |
| 01:01:00   | and then pull that into your Shortcut,                                                            |
| 01:01:02   | which means that when I want to edit,                                                             |
| 01:01:04   | I've got that lovely full-screen view                                                             |
| 01:01:06   | and all of my [[Drafts]] automations and formatting options                                           |
| 01:01:08   | right under my fingers.                                                                           |
| 01:01:09   | But when you do that, you still have to attach variables, correct?                                |
| 01:01:12   | It depends on what kind of thing I'm doing.                                                       |
| 01:01:14   | Sometimes I just need lots of text,                                                               |
| 01:01:17   | and I'm going to use it as is.                                                                    |
| 01:01:20   | But if you need the variables, it's not an ideal solution, no.                                    |
| 01:01:23   | And that's where the hang-up is for me.                                                           |
| 01:01:25   | The example of the OmniFocus project template                                                     |
| 01:01:28   | is I've got throughout that variables                                                             |
| 01:01:31   | with maybe a client name, a company name,                                                         |
| 01:01:34   | a contract name, or whatever.                                                                     |
| 01:01:36   | Sometimes four or five different variables                                                        |
| 01:01:38   | that are throughout that whole thing                                                              |
| 01:01:40   | is that process of trying to drop those variables in                                              |
| 01:01:43   | where madness ensues.                                                                             |
| 01:01:46   | Another one related to that is magic variables                                                    |
| 01:01:49   | are an amazing thing,                                                                             |
| 01:01:51   | especially for people without a lot of programming experience.                                    |
| 01:01:54   | They're not that discoverable.                                                                    |
| 01:01:56   | I feel like renaming them                                                                         |
| 01:02:00   | is really the only way to do it that makes any sense,                                             |
| 01:02:03   | but it's not obvious how to do that.                                                              |
| 01:02:05   | I would like to see them put the pedal down                                                       |
| 01:02:08   | on magic variables even more,                                                                     |
| 01:02:10   | make them easier to discover and use,                                                             |
| 01:02:12   | and maybe even have them auto-name                                                                |
| 01:02:15   | or do something better than the way they're currently run.                                        |
| 01:02:18   | Yes, that would be very useful.                                                                   |
| 01:02:20   | I'd also like the ability to unset variables                                                      |
| 01:02:22   | that I've previously set,                                                                         |
| 01:02:24   | to end up with a really long list of variables,                                                   |
| 01:02:26   | and you're there scrolling through,                                                               |
| 01:02:28   | going, okay, where's that one that was three steps back?                                          |
| 01:02:31   | Of course, then you just go to find magic variables,                                              |
| 01:02:34   | and you stop doing the horizontal scroll above the keyboard.                                      |
| 01:02:37   | But it would be really nice to sometimes,                                                         |
| 01:02:39   | you know, sometimes you need to grab something multiple times,                                    |
| 01:02:42   | but then that's it, you don't need it anymore.                                                    |
| 01:02:44   | Being able to unset that variable would be very useful.                                           |
| 01:02:47   | Going back to your discussion of the [[Apple]],                                                       |
| 01:02:50   | I would, on the Mac, I'm sorry,                                                                   |
| 01:02:52   | I would love to have [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]] on the Mac.                                                 |
| 01:02:54   | Would I love it enough to have them slow down                                                     |
| 01:02:57   | on iOS development so they could make that happen?                                                |
| 01:03:00   | That's the tricky part.                                                                           |
| 01:03:01   | That's a harder question for me, I'm not sure.                                                    |
| 01:03:03   | You know what I really want with iOS 13?                                                          |
| 01:03:06   | I want the shortcuts team to clone themselves.                                                    |
| 01:03:08   | Yes, there we go.                                                                                 |
| 01:03:09   | So that then half of them can work,                                                               |
| 01:03:11   | or one group of them can work on iOS,                                                             |
| 01:03:13   | and one group of them can work on Mac OS.                                                         |
| 01:03:15   | And they need to have full brain power,                                                           |
| 01:03:17   | so if they can get right on that,                                                                 |
| 01:03:18   | [[Apple|Apple's]] got the money, they'll be fine.                                                           |
| 01:03:20   | I feel like with the power of Apple events                                                        |
| 01:03:22   | that you probably could make it happen on the Mac,                                                |
| 01:03:24   | but I feel like at this point,                                                                    |
| 01:03:27   | it's in such an early stage for this automation,                                                  |
| 01:03:31   | and it is the only game in town on iOS.                                                           |
| 01:03:34   | I would almost prefer that they put all their effort                                              |
| 01:03:37   | into making it work better on iOS                                                                 |
| 01:03:39   | before they go to the Mac,                                                                        |
| 01:03:40   | but eventually I would like to see it on the Mac, too.                                            |
| 01:03:43   | Yes, and I will mention somebody,                                                                 |
| 01:03:45   | I'll see if I can find a link to it to put it in the show.                                        |
| 01:03:47   | Somebody has made a [[JavaScript]] editor for shortcuts, I believe,                                   |
| 01:03:51   | and it looks pretty good,                                                                         |
| 01:03:53   | but I love native solutions of the Shortcuts team.                                                |
| 01:03:56   | We're able to do this,                                                                            |
| 01:03:58   | and of course, I'm sure they've got tons of free time,                                            |
| 01:04:00   | and they love doing work in their free time as well as at work.                                   |
| 01:04:03   | That would be great, but as it is,                                                                |
| 01:04:05   | I am very happy with Shortcuts, I have to say.                                                    |
| 01:04:08   | Now, I haven't read your article yet.                                                             |
| 01:04:09   | Is there anything else that we haven't covered                                                    |
| 01:04:11   | in terms of things you'd like to see?                                                             |
| 01:04:13   | No, most of the other things are iOS and Mac OS related, though.                                  |
| 01:04:16   | I'm sure by the time I finished it,                                                               |
| 01:04:18   | there will be a few other goodies in there.                                                       |
| 01:04:20   | Yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:04:21   | All right, well, thank you, [[Apple]],                                                                |
| 01:04:23   | for continuing to update Siri Shortcuts.                                                          |
| 01:04:25   | I think that's a good sign.                                                                       |
| 01:04:27   | I still think that this is an experiment from [[Apple]] executives,                                   |
| 01:04:31   | you know, this whole thing.                                                                       |
| 01:04:33   | Every time I see the Siri Shortcuts team,                                                         |
| 01:04:35   | the one thing they always say is,                                                                 |
| 01:04:36   | thank you for talking about us,                                                                   |
| 01:04:38   | and please have people make Siri Shortcuts.                                                       |
| 01:04:40   | They haven't said to me explicitly,                                                               |
| 01:04:42   | but I do think that [[Apple]] is paying attention                                                     |
| 01:04:44   | to how many people use this,                                                                      |
| 01:04:46   | and that is going to affect how much                                                              |
| 01:04:49   | or how little love this application gets going forward.                                           |
| 01:04:51   | So, everybody try out some shortcuts.                                                             |
| 01:04:54   | And install it on your grandma's iPhone,                                                          |
| 01:04:56   | and tell it just to ignore it.                                                                    |
| 01:04:57   | It's fine.                                                                                        |
| 01:04:58   | It just needs to be installed.                                                                    |
| 01:04:59   | Oh, I like that.                                                                                  |
| 01:05:00   | That's a good one, Rose.                                                                          |
| 01:05:01   | I like that.                                                                                      |
| 01:05:02   | I'm going to do that with my kids, too,                                                           |
| 01:05:04   | because they don't use this stuff,                                                                |
| 01:05:06   | but maybe I'll just install it on their phones.                                                   |
| 01:05:08   | Anyway, and I'm really happy to see these updates coming.                                         |
| 01:05:11   | I can't wait to cover future updates together here.                                               |
| 01:05:13   | On Automators.                                                                                    |
| 01:05:15   | And if you've got some cool Siri Shortcuts stuff,                                                 |
| 01:05:18   | this would be a great time to share it over                                                       |
| 01:05:20   | in the Automators forum at talk.automators.fm.                                                    |
| 01:05:24   | Thank you to our sponsors today.                                                                  |
| 01:05:26   | That's our friends over at Creative Next and ExpressVPN.                                          |
| 01:05:29   | Did I miss anything, Rose?                                                                        |
| 01:05:31   | Note, that's everything.                                                                          |
| 01:05:33   | All right, we'll see you in a couple of weeks.                                                    |

| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined by my                    |
| 00:06      | wonderful co-host, David Sparks. And we are here to talk about how you can get your technology         |
| 00:11      | to do your work for you. And in today's episode, how it can make you fitter. Hello, David.             |
| 00:16      | Hello, Rosemary. How are you?                                                                          |
| 00:18      | I'm excited because it's a new year. Everybody likes to pretend to make health-based resolutions,      |
| 00:25      | and we're trying to find ways to automate it today.                                                    |
| 00:27      | Yeah, I know my gym. You have to make reservations to go. It's crazy now. There's so many new          |
| 00:31      | people there. That's great.                                                                            |
| 00:33      | Well, my new year's resolution was to not join a gym, and I am pleased to say that I'm                 |
| 00:37      | doing very well with this resolution so far.                                                           |
| 00:39      | You are crushing it.                                                                                   |
| 00:40      | I know. That said, I am looking at that swimming pool. There's a swimming pool about 12 minutes        |
| 00:46      | walk from me, and I'm looking at that, but it's not heated, so I'm not going there just                |
| 00:50      | yet.                                                                                                   |
| 00:51      | Yeah, of course not.                                                                                   |
| 00:53      | Well, it is pretty chilly outside, and unfortunately, you can't automate heating a non-heated swimming |
| 00:59      | pool.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00      | If only you could automate the swimming part so you could stay in bed and let the automation           |
| 01:05      | do the work for you.                                                                                   |
| 01:06      | I'm looking forward to that day. That would be good.                                                   |
| 01:09      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 01:10      | Though, I confess, I don't want to automate a robot that's going to eat my chocolate for               |
| 01:13      | me. I am quite happy to do that particular manual task all by myself.                                  |
| 01:16      | There you go. Well, we were thinking that, but it is new year, and a lot of people do                  |
| 01:22      | think about fitness this time of year.                                                                 |
| 01:25      | This is an area ripe with automation. Just like up until minutes before we started recording           |
| 01:30      | the show, both of us were coming up with new ideas and adding things to our systems.                   |
| 01:36      | I think that in particular, automation is helpful here because this is something a lot                 |
| 01:40      | of us have resistance to.                                                                              |
| 01:43      | One of the things we're going to talk about in the show today is my love-hate relationship             |
| 01:47      | with food tracking. Every time I track my food, I lose weight. It just works. It's magic.              |
| 01:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:53      | But I never can get myself to stop and track my food. I'm going to use some automation.                |
| 01:59      | We'll talk about that in the show today, but we got a bunch of automation stuff about fitness          |
| 02:03      | and health tracking, and this is going to be a fun show.                                               |
| 02:07      | Yeah. I think it might be a good idea to talk about why are you going to automate this stuff?          |
| 02:13      | As well as the options of actually getting this stuff logged, as you said with your food,              |
| 02:20      | if you don't automate these things, then it's probably going to be somewhat inaccurate.                |
| 02:24      | If you just take a guess at how far you ran, well, you're probably going to be way off.                |
| 02:29      | I don't know about you, but I'm always off with my distances when I'm estimating things.               |
| 02:33      | I'm there going, yeah, that's like 300 meters. It's like, no, no, that was 800 meters. I'm             |
| 02:39      | completely off here. That was well over double what I estimated, or you do it the other way            |
| 02:43      | around. That's definitely 800 meters, and it's only 300 meters, which are approximately                |
| 02:48      | the same in feet.                                                                                      |
| 02:50      | But a nice piece of this is, if you're willing to throw some money at this problem, technology         |
| 02:54      | exists to automate and get very accurate results with a lot of this stuff. You get an Apple            |
| 03:01      | watch and you're going to know exactly how far you ran or you swam.                                    |
| 03:06      | And similarly, you can even get toothbrushes, which are integrated with health kit to track            |
| 03:11      | your toothbrushing. Now, personally, I have not gone that far. I've looked at it, but                  |
| 03:15      | I'm very happy with my Sonic Air, which doesn't even have Bluetooth. I'm quite happy about             |
| 03:21      | that because it's probably got better battery life. But if you're struggling to keep track             |
| 03:25      | of whether or not you've brushed your teeth and things like that, then it's a great piece              |
| 03:28      | of tech.                                                                                               |
| 03:29      | That's an outrage that you don't have Bluetooth in your toothbrush.                                    |
| 03:32      | I did have Bluetooth in my toothbrush before, but the problem was I couldn't easily charge             |
| 03:35      | my toothbrush when traveling and I travel way more than I would actually track my toothbrushing        |
| 03:41      | because I know I brush my teeth twice a day and I do a decent job of it. My dentist is                 |
| 03:44      | happy. So I figured, well, I'll get the Sonic Air because the travel case, you can charge              |
| 03:50      | with mini USB, not even micro USB or USB-C charges with mini USB, but I've got a tiny                  |
| 03:55      | cable and that's great for traveling.                                                                  |
| 03:57      | Yeah, I hear about these connected toothbrushes and I really, this is even though we're about          |
| 04:03      | to do a whole show on automation, I don't get it. I don't understand. Isn't it just                    |
| 04:06      | running a two minute timer to make sure you brush your teeth long enough?                              |
| 04:10      | So the RLB that I had before with the Bluetooth, this didn't log it to the health application,         |
| 04:15      | but it had an app that it paired with and you could change the program on it and you                   |
| 04:20      | could say, hey, I'm currently having a problem. For example, I've got bad breath at the moment         |
| 04:25      | and it would put together a cleaning program and tell you which section of your mouth you              |
| 04:30      | should be cleaning between the brief pauses in the vibration or oscillation and it would               |
| 04:37      | change it and tell you exactly what you should be doing and you could also read the news               |
| 04:40      | while you are doing that. So it would show you some headlines and things and the weather               |
| 04:44      | and stuff, but the problem with that is your phone gets covered in toothpaste because you're           |
| 04:50      | there and you're suddenly distracted by the news and it's like, oh my gosh, there was                  |
| 04:53      | a bunny and it was really cute and then you've got toothpaste all over your phone, all because         |
| 04:59      | of a bunny in the news. So personally, I'm still not sold on the toothbrush automation                 |
| 05:03      | either, but the rest of it, I'm pretty interested by.                                                  |
| 05:06      | Yeah. So just to close the loop, I think that's crazy. Maybe this is an old man in the long            |
| 05:13      | moment for me, but I kind of look at brushing your teeth as one of those moments where you             |
| 05:17      | can stop and be mindful about brushing your teeth and you don't have to watch the news.                |
| 05:25      | I do have an electric toothbrush. It's an Oral-B and after two minutes, it pauses. So I just           |
| 05:32      | brush my teeth and when it does that, then I stop and I'm okay. So we're not going to                  |
| 05:38      | be selling a whole lot of connected toothbrushes today on the old Automator's podcast, but             |
| 05:44      | we do have some help for you either way. Yes, yes, we do. Sorry to go down a rabbit                    |
| 05:49      | hole, but that's interesting. Well, I mean, it's one of these things that people have                  |
| 05:53      | to consider because I remember a while ago, there was a discussion in the Mac Power users              |
| 05:57      | forum about water tracking applications and whether or not you actually need to track                  |
| 06:02      | how much you drink and so on. And there was somebody, and if I can find a link to this                 |
| 06:07      | thread, then I'll put it in the show notes. But they were saying that essentially they                 |
| 06:11      | realised that they were waking up with what felt like a hangover and it turned out that                |
| 06:14      | they were dehydrated. So well, technically, the rule should just be if you're thirsty,                 |
| 06:20      | sometimes it's good to have prompts. And I have been using WaterMinder to help me both                 |
| 06:25      | keep track of how much I drink and also to prompt me to drink throughout the day. And                  |
| 06:30      | I'm really happy with that solution because it's super easy. You set it up, it gets your               |
| 06:35      | height and weight out of the health app, asks you what kind of lifestyle you have, and then            |
| 06:40      | you can save different kinds of glasses and so on in there with different amounts of liquid            |
| 06:44      | and you can even specify that it's Coca-Cola or coffee or tea or water or sparkling water.             |
| 06:50      | And that, for me, was pretty much the gateway drug into automating my health tracking. I               |
| 06:55      | haven't yet got a connective water bottle, but I keep looking at them, so.                             |
| 07:01      | I think that's a great idea, Rose. Having something to tap you on the shoulder. I mean,                |
| 07:05      | we all need a buddy to tap us on the shoulder as we go through the day as we're trying                 |
| 07:09      | to get better at health and fitness. And unless you're like a movie star or a president,               |
| 07:13      | you don't have people following you around to tell you what to do. But you can use that                |
| 07:18      | with technology. And I think, I just think this is one of the best uses of automation                  |
| 07:24      | and using the stuff we've talked about on the show, I think anybody can implement this                 |
| 07:29      | stuff with relatively easy automation. I might as well go into it right now. So one of my,             |
| 07:36      | similar to Rose's water tracking, I'm really trying to get better at tracking my food.                 |
| 07:41      | As I said earlier, this is something I can do that always makes me healthier. If I have                |
| 07:45      | to write down, I'm going to eat the chocolate cake quite often. I don't actually eat the               |
| 07:49      | chocolate cake. It just works, you know. Yes. So the problem is, if you look at me over                |
| 07:56      | the last week, I have tracked my breakfast every day. And there's a couple of days that                |
| 08:02      | I tracked my lunch. And there are no days that I tracked my dinner, you know, because                  |
| 08:08      | I just run out of gas, I guess. So what I've done is I've created a very brief shortcut                |
| 08:13      | here and we'll end up putting this in the, a link to this in the show notes. But this                  |
| 08:19      | is a, you know, in terms of shortcuts, this is a real easy one. It, let me just get it                 |
| 08:23      | open here. So don't screw it up. The, uh, whoops, I just triggered it. It's a choose                   |
| 08:28      | from menu with two options. Do you need to log some food? Question mark, that's the prompt.            |
| 08:34      | And then it's a yes or no. And if it's a yes, then it just opens my fitness pal, which                 |
| 08:40      | is the app I use to track food in. There's others you could put whatever app you want                  |
| 08:44      | in, but I wanted to give myself a reward. If I don't, if this comes up and I've already                |
| 08:50      | tracked on my family, give myself a reward. So I showed an alert, this is good job sparky              |
| 08:54      | and has a little cute emoji. Now I would like to go deeper with this. Uh, Rose and I were              |
| 08:59      | talking before the show, maybe I'll add a random generator and add like one of like 10                 |
| 09:04      | emojis. So I get a different one every time. Um, even better, I would like to have it put              |
| 09:10      | the confetti on the screen like you get, you know, in the messages app. I'm not sure if                |
| 09:15      | I can figure out how to do that. But so, or some sort of animation. I don't want to play               |
| 09:19      | songs because I may be in a place where I can't have music come up. But anyway, so I                   |
| 09:23      | made, I made this really simple shortcut that allowed that either prompts me to go to my               |
| 09:27      | fitness pal and catch up for the last few hours or, um, or, or it gives me some positive               |
| 09:34      | feedback. Now what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to run it at a specific time.                |
| 09:40      | You know, so this is going to go at 10 a.m. And it's going to go at 2 p.m. And it's going              |
| 09:46      | to go at 7 p.m. Cause usually both, all those are, you know, within a few hours of probably            |
| 09:51      | my last meal. So, uh, I don't, I, as someone who hates notifications on my phone, uh, this             |
| 09:57      | is worth it for me because I think it's going to help me get healthier. And that's, it's               |
| 10:01      | just a silly little automation, but, and it's not actually tracking the food. I still have             |
| 10:05      | to do the work of going in my fitness pal and tracking the food, but it's, uh, hopefully               |
| 10:10      | going to keep me on track.                                                                             |
| 10:13      | That's a really smart way of doing it. And especially if you, if you're one of those                   |
| 10:17      | people that feels like you need to get tracking health and, and doing some things to try and           |
| 10:21      | improve your health, it can be kind of difficult to talk to other people and having technology         |
| 10:26      | is your friend there. Technology doesn't judge you. It just, you know, it sets, it does whatever       |
| 10:30      | you tell it to do. Um, and for me, for me, that's a great thing. Cause I don't want to                 |
| 10:35      | be judged for not going to the gym cause I never go to the gym. Um, but I'm also aware                 |
| 10:40      | that I never go to the gym. So I'm, I'm okay with that, but it's, it's nice that I've got              |
| 10:44      | my setup here that doesn't, you know, tell me, so did you go to the gym today when I                   |
| 10:48      | don't even have a gym membership and I don't even know where the nearest gym is.                       |
| 10:52      | Yeah. I mean, you just got to work on the problem that you're dealing with. It may, like you           |
| 10:55      | were talking earlier, it's maybe for you, it's tracking water for me. For me, it's keeping             |
| 11:00      | the chocolate cake out of my face. Um, but the, uh, you know, this is stuff anybody can                |
| 11:06      | implement and it can make a difference. Yes, it absolutely can. And I think that's what                |
| 11:11      | everybody should think about. You know, maybe you don't have any health problems at all                |
| 11:14      | and you, you're pretty happy and healthy. Well, you can actually keep an eye on how happy              |
| 11:18      | and healthy you are and then figure it out later.                                                      |
| 11:22      | My fitness pal is particularly good for if you want to do something like food tracking                 |
| 11:26      | because they remember prior meals you have a huge database. If you type in a restaurant                |
| 11:32      | name, there's a good chance they're going to have things in there. Um, if you eat something            |
| 11:36      | out of a box, they have a scanner there. You can scan the code on the box and it's probably            |
| 11:42      | going to have the food already in its library. So, uh, getting back to that earlier point              |
| 11:47      | about accurate data, uh, I have extremely accurate data on the food I consume if I go                  |
| 11:53      | through the steps of, of tracking the food. Yes. And this also integrates with the apple               |
| 11:57      | health application. You may have to trigger it from inside the, my fitness pal settings                |
| 12:01      | to do that. Um, but you, you can integrate with all of that information there and sink                 |
| 12:05      | your weights and everything. So if you've got, for example, health kit scales, uh, like                |
| 12:09      | the, I think it's why things scale, um, connects to the apple health app, then that data also          |
| 12:14      | ends up in my fitness pal, um, very easily, which is very useful. Um, and I, I have to                 |
| 12:20      | say I've always enjoyed my fitness pal and the fact that you can create recipes in it                  |
| 12:24      | as well because I love to kick. So being able to put my recipe in there and then say, okay,            |
| 12:27      | I made this recipe and ate a quarter of it. Uh, it's pretty good. Yeah. Agreed. Um, there              |
| 12:33      | are other apps that, that do this for you. Um, but Rose and I both use my fitness pal.                 |
| 12:38      | So I don't really, I can't really speak to the other apps, but, um, this is not the                    |
| 12:42      | only app that can do that. And, and it does a lot more. They've got a premium plan if                  |
| 12:46      | you want that, that gives you, I think additional information. I'm, I'm not a subscriber. I            |
| 12:51      | just use the basic plan and I use it to track food and it also tracks my log out, my workouts.         |
| 12:57      | So it just kind of gives me running tally as I get through the day of how I'm doing.                   |
| 13:01      | Um, something you mentioned, Rose, I'd like to kind of go in a little deeper. I don't                  |
| 13:04      | think a lot of people understand is the data sharing model with [[Apple|Apple's]] health and fitness             |
| 13:10      | data.                                                                                                  |
| 13:11      | Oh yeah, this is so good. So there are a whole host of devices, a lot of them available in             |
| 13:16      | the Apple store, but they're not exclusively available in the Apple store. There are devices           |
| 13:20      | available elsewhere that can connect directly to the health app. So you can get things like            |
| 13:24      | thermometers and scales and jump ropes that track how many times you've jumped rope. Um,               |
| 13:30      | and these connect to the health app. Um, but a lot of these just work on device. They don't            |
| 13:35      | necessarily store your data somewhere else in a server, which is pretty nice, but also                 |
| 13:40      | they can even share this with your doctor. Um, if your doctor surgery is set up to do                  |
| 13:45      | that, unfortunately mine here in Austria, when I asked about health integration, he                    |
| 13:49      | looked at me and he said, I'm still running Windows seven. So no, um, but, um, you can                 |
| 13:56      | get a lot of this data and it's really nice, you know, being able to do an ECG on your                 |
| 13:59      | watch and show it to somebody, that's pretty cool. And being able to send that as a PDF                |
| 14:04      | by email is even better.                                                                               |
| 14:06      | Yeah, I just think this is something that, uh, where [[Apple]] has really done well. I mean,               |
| 14:11      | we give [[Apple]] a hard time sometimes on the show, but, uh, the management of health data,               |
| 14:17      | first they protect your privacy, they keep it on device. Um, but they encrypt it so you                |
| 14:22      | can make a backup of it. I mean, for a while that was an issue, like you lose data if you              |
| 14:26      | had a new device because of the way the health data was stored, but also they have a completely        |
| 14:31      | user manageable way to both export data out of health to applications and import data                  |
| 14:38      | from applications. So applications that want to tie into the health system can do it. I've             |
| 14:44      | got this dumb little meditation timer that I've been using every day for, I think as                   |
| 14:49      | long as I've had my iPhone, it goes way back, but it has health integration. So my meditations         |
| 14:54      | get logged into my health app. And that's just an example of, uh, of so many apps,                     |
| 14:59      | like, you know, my fitness pal shares a ton of data back and forth. And, but you can totally           |
| 15:05      | control it as a user. So if you wake up one day and find out my fitness pal just got bought            |
| 15:09      | by somebody and you don't want your data going to them anymore, you can turn it off with,              |
| 15:14      | within seconds on your phone. I just think it's such a really, you know, it's such a                   |
| 15:18      | good implementation. In fact, I look at this and then I look at what they've done with                 |
| 15:24      | the time tracking stuff, you know, where they app tracking and how many times you pick up              |
| 15:29      | your phone and all that. Um, they don't do any of that with that data. You know, that                  |
| 15:33      | data is completely siloed in that, uh, the [[Apple]] application. I would love to see third                |
| 15:40      | party developers be able to access and use that data, but they can't. Uh, so it is an                  |
| 15:44      | interesting contrast, but for health data, you have the benefit of being able to put                   |
| 15:49      | it anywhere you want. And that that allows you to get apps like water tracking apps or                 |
| 15:55      | health apps and, and use that data to your best advantage.                                             |
| 15:59      | Yes. And that's what I really find amazing because as well as all of these apps out there,             |
| 16:04      | you also have shortcuts integration, which we'll dive into a little bit deeper later                   |
| 16:08      | in the show. Um, but you can get all of this data in and out with shortcuts, which allows              |
| 16:13      | you to do your own calculations and create your own views of results. Um, and, and summaries,          |
| 16:19      | which I, I really like. And the, the features that they recently added, especially the menstruation    |
| 16:24      | tracking, that's really useful for those people who need it. And, uh, I'm really pleased               |
| 16:28      | to see that this is continuing to grow and be better. And, uh, there's stuff's working                 |
| 16:33      | really well for me. Um, and, uh, the, the new UI is pretty. So that always helps.                      |
| 16:39      | I just feel like this is one section of [[Apple]] that's like clicking on all cylinders right              |
| 16:43      | now. They're just doing a great job.                                                                   |
| 16:45      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                       |

| 17:55      | Well, we've talked about getting data into the health application, and that's always                   |
| 18:00      | a good start. But sometimes it's nice to build the habit of actually doing the thing that              |
| 18:05      | generates the data. And this is something I've been playing a lot with recently with                   |
| 18:09      | the Streaks app, which is a habit tracking application, but it has integration with the                |
| 18:13      | health kit. And I am loving this because you can just be going around walking, you know,               |
| 18:19      | you get on with your day and it turns out you've met your exercise ring and Streaks                    |
| 18:23      | sends you a notification and says, Hey, you've met your exercise goal for the third day in             |
| 18:28      | a row. Now, of course, this is built into the activity rings and the health app in general,            |
| 18:34      | where you can track this information. But combining this with all of the other information             |
| 18:38      | is pretty nice. And you can also specify that you want to do a 10 minute workout and start             |
| 18:43      | a timer and things like that. And it connects to the health app to synchronise all of this             |
| 18:47      | data. And that's that's been really good fun for me playing with this.                                 |
| 18:51      | Hey, this is such an interesting category, because so often on this show, we have to                   |
| 18:55      | talk about building custom automations to make a lot of this stuff work. And in this                   |
| 19:00      | case, there's multiple app developers that are using this data store we've talked about                |
| 19:05      | to do the work for us. So you know, like Streaks is a good example of that.                            |
| 19:09      | Yes. And what I really like about Streaks as well is they're aware that people will                    |
| 19:14      | want to do things outside of their app. So they've built in shortcut support. So what                  |
| 19:18      | you could do is when you open an application to track your workout. So I've been using                 |
| 19:23      | an app called swim tracker recently, then logs for me that I'm doing that habit. Now,                  |
| 19:30      | I am, you know, taking myself, you know, trusting myself perhaps a little too much here, I could       |
| 19:35      | just open the swim app every day without going to the swimming pool. But I've set up my shortcuts      |
| 19:40      | automation so that when I open this application, it marks my habit as done in Streaks for me.          |
| 19:46      | And that's really handy because then you don't have to think about it and you can just integrate       |
| 19:50      | it into these other aspects of your life. Yeah, it's really awesome. And I do think                    |
| 19:55      | that in this episode, like I would recommend downloading a bunch of these apps and trying              |
| 20:00      | them out to help automate your health stuff. Yes. And especially, you know, finding a habit            |
| 20:06      | tracking application that integrates with health, I think is really good if you're looking             |
| 20:10      | to build these habits, because then you can specify that you want to work out twice a                  |
| 20:14      | week or something. And it could be any two days of the work or specifically Mondays and                |
| 20:18      | Thursdays. And these just help you build those habits and build those Streaks. And of course,          |
| 20:23      | once you've started building the habit, it's easy to keep going. So especially if you've               |
| 20:28      | got the data to prove that you're doing something and you know that you've done it.                    |
| 20:32      | I'd like to talk about accountability automation. So I have, in addition to having my watch            |
| 20:40      | tap me on the shoulder, I actually have a friend that him and I kind of keep each other.               |
| 20:46      | We share each other's data. We're like friends on my fitness pal. So like, if I stop for               |
| 20:53      | a long time or whatever, he'll call me or give me a message. And I keep an eye on him                  |
| 20:57      | too. It's just like kind of an accountability friend. But I'm not that good about like sending         |
| 21:03      | him updates. You know, I guess I'm relying on him to go look at my data, which is kind                 |
| 21:08      | of a pain in the neck. So I think it'd be fun to automate like a daily or weekly text                  |
| 21:14      | message, giving him a summary of data out of the health app. And this is one Rose where                |
| 21:20      | I came up with the idea, but I haven't solved it yet. You know, I'm assuming that I can                |
| 21:26      | like even maybe with some of these third party apps, pull data out of the health app, then             |
| 21:31      | turn that into a text file. And once I've got into a text file, then I'm golden, you                   |
| 21:35      | know, I can send a message and automate the whole process. But the trick I need to figure              |
| 21:40      | out is how to get my own report out of the health app. Is that as easy as I'm assuming                 |
| 21:45      | it is?                                                                                                 |
| 21:46      | Well, I was experimenting with exactly this today because I wanted to do an end of the                 |
| 21:50      | day summary of my activity and put it in [[Day One]]. And I wanted to do this with shortcuts               |
| 21:56      | because this is me. And if I'm not using shortcuts, then it does seem like something                   |
| 21:59      | might be going wrong with the world. And so I built this and you can get a lot of data                 |
| 22:05      | out. And more importantly, once you've got that data, so there's an action to get health               |
| 22:11      | data or health sample, it's called. But then you can use there is a another action. It's               |
| 22:18      | not the calculate action. I've forgotten the name of it. And I'm just double checking what             |
| 22:21      | it is so I don't get it wrong. Calculate statistics. That's the one. And then you can do something     |
| 22:26      | like an average, a minimum, a maximum, or for example, in the case of my steps. So I                   |
| 22:31      | get all of the steps health samples from today. And then I do a sum and adds them all up.              |
| 22:37      | So I've got 23 steps here and 48 steps over there and so on. And then it shortcuts just                |
| 22:44      | adds it all up for me. So I have it. Now, I haven't spent a lot of time formatting this                |
| 22:47      | yet. At the moment, it's still, you know, steps, colon, number of steps and weight, colon,             |
| 22:52      | my weight at the moment. And I'm considering adding emojis to that in increasing levels                |
| 22:57      | of happiness. No sad faces because I like to motivate myself. But you can do all sorts                 |
| 23:05      | with this. And I'm sure there are other apps out there that can export things in a pretty              |
| 23:09      | kind of report that you're looking for. But I haven't run into one yet. So I'm thinking                |
| 23:14      | that might be some homework for our listeners. Yeah. Another way I could do this that is               |
| 23:18      | less fancy because the person has access to my data because I've been enabled it already               |
| 23:24      | is just to create a draft message at the end of the day with a fill in snippet. You know,              |
| 23:31      | it's like today I did or did not track all my food. And today I did or did not hit my                  |
| 23:38      | rings, you know, just, I mean, there's just two or three metrics that I'm looking at.                  |
| 23:42      | And I know the answers to them. Yeah. So I could do that as well. And honestly, maybe                  |
| 23:48      | the advantage of that could because this is about personal motivation as well, forcing                 |
| 23:52      | myself to push the button to say I didn't track my food. Yeah. Before this message gets                |
| 23:56      | in every day. Well, that's some accountability right there. Yeah, it is. And I really like             |
| 24:01      | that. I'm currently trying to build. So [[Federico Viticci]] built the music bot in Shortcuts. I'm          |
| 24:07      | personally, I'm trying to build my personal health assistant bot. It's nowhere near as                 |
| 24:11      | complicated or as fancy, but I'm trying to get it to check in on me via push cut on random             |
| 24:17      | intervals and things like that so that I then have to give it more information about how               |
| 24:22      | I'm doing and what I'm doing. And if I feel like I'm doing a good job. Yeah. I mean, and               |
| 24:26      | of course there's a line with this stuff. You can, you can go crazy with it. Yes. Yeah.                |
| 24:32      | But for instance, this food tracking automation is talking about earlier. If, if I can turn            |
| 24:37      | that into a habit, you know, if I can get myself in the mindset that I'm a person that                 |
| 24:41      | tracks all my food, then maybe the notification will just be once a day at the end of the              |
| 24:46      | day instead of three times a day. But right now I am clearly suffering from a problem                  |
| 24:50      | that I can't get this habit started. So I'm going to give myself more notifications. And               |
| 24:55      | that's one of the nice things about being an automator is you can always go back and                   |
| 24:58      | change this stuff and tone it down or tone it up as you need to. Yes, exactly. And I                   |
| 25:03      | think that's, that's one of the big takeaways with the automation of aspect of this is you,            |
| 25:08      | you can, you know, tweak that until it's at what you feel is the right level for you.                  |
| 25:14      | And I know at the moment it feels like WaterMinder is bucking me a little too much with the water.     |
| 25:18      | So I need to go in and tweak those notifications. But that, that's part of the awareness that          |
| 25:23      | is necessary to building good health habits. So as I'm thinking about it, you know, I talked           |
| 25:28      | earlier, I have a seven PM, did you track your food shortcut automation? I could easily                |
| 25:35      | add to that, you know, did you hit all your rings today? And then I, then I could auto                 |
| 25:41      | generate a text message to my buddy that gives the results of that. You know, today David              |
| 25:47      | did or did not track all his food or today David did hit or did not hit all those rings                |
| 25:53      | and then then it puts the message on my screen. I could even automate where it sends it automatically. |
| 25:59      | It's easy enough with shortcuts. Yep. So yeah, it's this, this could be fun.                           |
| 26:05      | Yes, it definitely can be. And there's, there's a lot of choices that we can make out there            |
| 26:09      | to see what we can do with these things. And I know that you've, you've been experimenting             |
| 26:14      | with some, some things at the gym recently. Yeah, I mean, I just, we, the type of, of                  |
| 26:22      | gym we go to, but it's like a, the workout is like planned for you. You go in and they                 |
| 26:28      | push you around. They're like, jump on the treadmill, go lift weights, you know, whatever.             |
| 26:31      | So, so it's nice. And [[Apple]] added the high interval, what's it called, the high intense                |
| 26:37      | and interval training as a, as a potential, which is the type of work I did. Because when              |
| 26:41      | I was doing it, before they added that, I would do these workouts and I'd be on the                    |
| 26:45      | treadmill, but then I'd switch over to the weights or to the rowing machine. And I was                 |
| 26:49      | doing this constantly and it's like, you couldn't stop and reset a workout every like 10 minutes.      |
| 26:55      | It's madness. So it's nice. Yes, definitely. Getting back to good data because of the technology.      |
| 27:01      | Yes, absolutely. And I, what I've done at the moment is I've got a couple of automations               |
| 27:07      | built in. I've been trying to use the, started an Apple Watch workout automation, but the              |
| 27:14      | problem is, is that the swimming pool, I leave my phone in the locker and it's too far away            |
| 27:18      | and there's no wifi at the swimming pool, which is probably for the best because do                    |
| 27:21      | you really want to take your iPad for a swim? Probably not. But it means that I can't use              |
| 27:26      | that one. And I can't use the automation of when I stop a workout either because my, my                |
| 27:31      | phone is too far away from my watch. So I've been using notifications when I arrive and                |
| 27:37      | when I leave to help me try and track this information. And especially the one where                   |
| 27:41      | I leave, I'm working on getting the amount of time that I spent swimming and the distance              |
| 27:45      | that I swam and logging that to [[Day One]] so that I can have like a little personal health               |
| 27:50      | general with all of the data in it. Yeah. One of the tricks for me was I, I did not have               |
| 27:57      | the habit of turning the workout on when I went to the gym. I'd go because there's                     |
| 28:01      | a separate health monitor you wear there and they, they shame you, you know, if your heart's           |
| 28:06      | not going hard enough. So, so I would go in there and I get to the workout and realise                 |
| 28:10      | I forgot to turn the workout on. So I had an automation where it was a shortcut and                    |
| 28:15      | it just was location based. If I got to the gym, then it would give me the notification,               |
| 28:21      | hey, buddy, turn on your workout. And that was great because it would remind me every                  |
| 28:24      | time I'd go. Unfortunately, the round table pizza is right next door. So I took my daughter            |
| 28:31      | to pizza once and it told me to start a workout and just made me feel terrible. But yeah,              |
| 28:37      | but, but I got thinking, well, what are some better ways to solve that problem? And the                |
| 28:42      | thing you could do it like if the gym has Wi-Fi and like, you know, some of these gyms                 |
| 28:47      | you have, you know, they're very fancy places you can plug into their Wi-Fi. So you could              |
| 28:50      | use Wi-Fi as a trigger. I think that would be a closer way of getting, you know, that                  |
| 28:55      | accurate. And then, you know, based on the whole I beacon run we had last month, I was                 |
| 28:59      | thinking, if you had a locker, what if you just put an I beacon in your locker? Yeah,                  |
| 29:03      | that would be a pretty good solution. That's space you control. You can put it in there                |
| 29:07      | or if you don't have a locker, if you could find a place for it. I don't think it would                |
| 29:10      | work with my particular gym, but that would be another way if you're having trouble. Fortunately,      |
| 29:17      | you know, as habits go, I'm totally ingrained now. Once I sit down to start a workout, I               |
| 29:22      | do it on my watch and I don't need my technology to remind me, but it did take a few months            |
| 29:26      | for me to get there. Yes. And fortunately, you know, the Apple Watch is helping us there               |
| 29:30      | now with its own automation of when you when you've started doing something that it thinks             |
| 29:34      | is a workout, it prompts you to track it. And this happened to me quite a few times                    |
| 29:39      | over Christmas. So a lot of people think, oh Christmas, yes, time to sit back and relax.               |
| 29:44      | Well, I ended up walking a lot over Christmas because I didn't want to wait 20 minutes in              |
| 29:49      | the cold to take a bus. And so we would just walk home instead of standing for 20 minutes              |
| 29:54      | and then spending 10 minutes on the bus. We just walked the whole way. And that was really             |
| 29:59      | good to get those tracked because it turned out I was working out pretty hard.                         |
| 30:03      | That was back in England?                                                                              |
| 30:04      | Yeah, no, that was here in Vienna. So it's been pretty chilly and I've been doing a lot                |
| 30:09      | of walking over Christmas. So I'm a little bit tired now. But I think the cheese fondue                |
| 30:13      | probably has been worked off.                                                                          |
| 30:15      | Yeah, I've been in a lot of cold places, you know, I've been in Alaska on the glaciers.                |
| 30:21      | I've been I've been in a lot of cold places in my life. I have never been as cold as I                 |
| 30:24      | was when I was walking around where you grew up in January. That was like this, this wind              |
| 30:32      | that would come over these hills. And I've just never been so cold in my life. I don't                 |
| 30:37      | know what.                                                                                             |
| 30:38      | I mean, you went to Stonehenge as well, right? And it's so exposed that it is absolutely               |
| 30:42      | freezing. But I did grow up just down the road from Stonehenge. And it does get pretty                 |
| 30:46      | pretty nippy out there.                                                                                |
| 30:47      | Yes, I still shiver when I think about it. It wasn't like I didn't have enough jackets                 |
| 30:51      | on. I had I had many layers and scarves. And there's this picture of me and my family,                 |
| 30:56      | you know, the Southern California, you know, wimps. And we just look miserable. So cold.               |
| 31:03      | Yes. But that leads me to another automation that I've been looking at. So I've been I've              |
| 31:10      | tried running before. And unfortunately, I have a bit of a knee issue. So my knees do                  |
| 31:13      | not appreciate me going running, but I do like to go for walks. And so one thing that                  |
| 31:18      | I have been building into my morning shortcut that I run every morning that tells me, you              |
| 31:23      | know, what I've got going on for the day is when it checks the weather, it tells me if                 |
| 31:27      | it's a good day to go for a walk, or what time would be a good time to go for a walk                   |
| 31:31      | during the day if, you know, if there's rain forecast. And that's something I'm working                |
| 31:34      | on because that's an easy way to prompt you to do your habit at a good time, you know,                 |
| 31:40      | so you don't go, well, I was going to go for a walk, but now it's raining and it's going               |
| 31:43      | rain for the rest of the day. When actually you had four hours before that, you just didn't            |
| 31:47      | know it was going to start raining then. And so I'm using that. And I'm trying to extract              |
| 31:51      | the data out of carrot to do that. The Apple weather application is really good. I just                |
| 31:57      | prefer the carrot weather, because it also has snarky comments. Yeah. And going back                   |
| 32:02      | to the show we did on calendar automation, a lot of this stuff also lends into that.                   |
| 32:08      | You could automate calendar blocks like for workouts or taking walks or whatever. And                  |
| 32:16      | if you put them on the calendar, then they're more likely to happen. I mean, all this stuff            |
| 32:19      | is just allowing the computer to make it easier for the human to work. Yes, exactly. And that's        |
| 32:28      | what you need to be thinking about when you're doing these health things, because I know               |
| 32:32      | if it's too hard for me to track it and do it, then I just won't. And this is how I end                |
| 32:36      | up spending six hours watching Netflix, binging chocolate and popcorn, which is kind of the            |
| 32:41      | opposite of what I'm intending to do, but it happens much too easily because I don't                   |
| 32:47      | make it easy enough for myself to build the healthy habits. Yeah. Agreed. Agreed. Well,                |
| 32:54      | I think that this is something that all of us can get a little better at. We're going                  |
| 32:58      | to share some of the shortcuts and stuff we've talked about during the show in the show notes.         |
| 33:02      | So check that out. But we're going to talk about right after this. This episode of The                 |

| 33:15      | At three months free with a one year package. We all know how VPN protects your privacy                |
| 33:21      | and security online, but did you know it can take your TV watching to the next level by                |
| 33:27      | unlocking movies and shows that are only available in other countries? That means you can use          |
| 33:32      | ExpressVPN to binge on Doctor Who or Star Trek on the UK Netflix. It's really simple.                  |
| 33:39      | Just fire up the ExpressVPN app and change your location to the UK then refresh Netflix.               |
| 33:46      | And that's it. ExpressVPN hides your IP address so you can control where you want sites to             |
| 33:52      | think you're located and you can choose from almost 100 different countries. Just think                |
| 33:56      | about all the Netflix libraries you can go through. So if you love anime, you can use                  |
| 34:02      | ExpressVPN to access Japanese Netflix. And it's not just Netflix. ExpressVPN works with                |
| 34:07      | any streaming service. Hulu, BBC, iPlayer, YouTube, whatever you want. For instance,                   |
| 34:13      | you listeners in the UK, you did not get the Mandalorian because Disney Plus isn't there yet.          |
| 34:18      | Maybe that's what you need to do because it's awesome. Either way, there are hundreds of               |
| 34:23      | VPNs out there, but ExpressVPN is ridiculously fast, which you want when you're watching shows.        |
| 34:28      | There's no buffering, no lag, and you can stream in HD. ExpressVPN is also compatible                  |
| 34:33      | with all your devices like phones, media consoles, smart TVs, you name it, they cover it.              |
| 34:39      | So you can watch what you want wherever you want. I am an ExpressVPN subscriber. Use it all the time.  |
| 34:45      | I really like the security I get from it. I travel a lot and I just don't want the guy in              |
| 34:51      | Starbucks that's sniffing the Wi-Fi to get access to whatever I'm up to. So whenever I am not on my    |
| 34:57      | home Wi-Fi, I turn ExpressVPN on and I am happy and safe and secure. If you go to the link right       |

| 35:22      | So we still have quite a few things left to cover today, don't we, David?                              |
| 35:27      | We do.                                                                                                 |
| 35:28      | Yes. And I think the first one that I would like to mention is turning the not so smart health         |
| 35:35      | tracking devices that we have. I've got a pair of Fitbit scales and I want to get this information     |
| 35:42      | into the Apple Health app. And so I've set up a series of shortcuts and I have a shortcut whenever     |
| 35:48      | I step on the scales, I run it and it asks me how much I weigh, what my body fat percentage is,        |
| 35:52      | and then it calculates my BMI and it saves all of these three data points into shortcuts.              |
| 35:58      | And this led me down a whole rabbit hole because it turns out my dad has been testing his blood        |
| 36:03      | sugar quite a bit because he wants to make sure that he doesn't have diabetes and he's fine and        |
| 36:09      | that's a good thing. But he didn't have a great way of keeping track of the data because he just       |
| 36:13      | bought a dumb device from the chemists and it worked perfectly and was very accurate.                  |
| 36:19      | And so I created a mini shortcut for him to track this information. And then my mom's blood pressure   |
| 36:24      | device needed their information tracking. So I spent a little bit of time recently creating            |
| 36:29      | tracking information shortcuts for my whole family so that they can store this information             |
| 36:34      | in shortcuts without having to upgrade all of their devices.                                           |
| 36:37      | Okay. So I have a pretty good idea how you're capturing the information. This is probably              |
| 36:43      | asking for user input. Exactly. And collecting data. But where are you storing the data?               |
| 36:49      | In the health application. So if you look in shortcuts, then there is an action to log a               |
| 36:54      | health sample. And this can log pretty much any kind of health sample. Now a few of the things         |
| 36:59      | added at [[WWDC]] last year, so with iOS 13 are not available. So tooth brushing last I checked was        |
| 37:07      | not in here. And I'm seeing now that it's also still not here. But you've got all sorts of things      |
| 37:12      | there. So you can track your protein or potassium or the number of times you've fallen or iodine,      |
| 37:19      | heart rate variability, headphone, audio levels, all sorts of things. So if you've got a device        |
| 37:26      | that can help you get information, there's a pretty good chance you're going to be able to             |
| 37:30      | get it into the health app with shortcuts. And this then builds a whole series of data.                |
| 37:35      | And my dad's doctor, I am pleased to say it was very impressed when my dad went in                     |
| 37:39      | with his phone and was able to show him all this data. And was also very pleased to tell               |
| 37:45      | him that everything was fine. Yeah. And this may be the solution I need to look at this because        |
| 37:51      | there's also get health samples from the health data. So that may be the solution if I want to make    |
| 37:57      | like like you're saying the daily text message to the buddy, I could get details out of the app        |
| 38:02      | that way and just drop it in. Yes. And that's what I've been experimenting with with shortcuts         |
| 38:07      | as well to try and get a daily summary into [[Day One]] at the end of the day so that I can go back        |
| 38:12      | and look over at this information in the context of everything else because I like to also add my      |
| 38:17      | workouts to [[Day One]] so that I've got all of my workouts logged there and so on. So I can see           |
| 38:23      | how consistent I'm being with tracking my data. The answer has been so far not very,                   |
| 38:28      | but with automation, it's improving. There you go. I mean, that's the trick, isn't it?                 |
| 38:33      | Yes, definitely. So and then the one for your mom is just the same thing, just tracking different      |
| 38:38      | data and saving it to a different data store. Exactly. So this all goes into the health app,           |
| 38:43      | which is ideal because I'm not going to start saving somebody else's personal health information       |
| 38:47      | onto a server. You know, I do own a server and have data on it, but it's not health information.       |
| 38:52      | And quite frankly, it's most useful to my parents in the health app and it's pretty easy to run.       |
| 38:57      | They would never reset shortcuts up for themselves, but I added it to the home screen and so they      |
| 39:02      | just type on the icon on the home screen now and run the data and it works. And they're very happy     |
| 39:07      | with it. I was thinking while you were just saying that this is an excellent one to use if you've      |
| 39:12      | got a family member that has some sort of health data they need to track and they've got an iPhone.    |
| 39:17      | If you're listening to the automators, you're kind of a self-selecting pull of nerds,                  |
| 39:20      | I got to tell you, sorry, you know, but that's true. But you could create this shortcut,               |
| 39:26      | a very simple one. And we'll probably, are you willing to share that one, Rose?                        |
| 39:28      | Yeah, absolutely. I'll share a couple of them in the show notes.                                       |
| 39:32      | All right, so we'll put that one. So you can just download it and then, you know, customise it to      |
| 39:36      | whatever your family member needs. And the thing Rose did, I think, is genius is you save it as a      |
| 39:42      | home screen app because you can do that in shortcuts. You can turn a shortcut essentially into an app. |
| 39:47      | And then they just push a button on their home screen and log their daily whatever. And that           |
| 39:53      | would be really good. Yes. And it's definitely cheaper than buying the new devices. You know,          |
| 39:59      | if you don't have a blood pressure monitor and you need to start tracking your blood pressure,         |
| 40:03      | then it's of course worth considering, do I want the cheapest one I can find or do I want the one      |
| 40:08      | with health integration? But if you already own one, then I would say take that question off the       |
| 40:12      | table and find a different way of logging the data. Because if you're actively going out of            |
| 40:16      | your way to measure blood pressure, you can spend 30 seconds to log the data.                          |
| 40:20      | Or like in my case, I have a withing scale. I bought it in technology years, you know,                 |
| 40:26      | eons ago. I think I've had it like six or seven years. And I am certain that the Wi-Fi radio           |
| 40:32      | in that is dragging down my whole network. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so maybe I'll just disconnect it      |
| 40:39      | from the Wi-Fi and then I'll just run a shortcut instead. And it's not that much more work just        |
| 40:44      | to type it in myself. Yeah. And also then you can, so bearing in mind that I track my weight           |
| 40:52      | in kilograms and my height is in centimeters, you calculate BMI slightly differently compared          |
| 40:57      | to if you're tracking your weight in pounds and your height in inches and feet. But I actually,        |
| 41:03      | then because I am logging my data, I calculate my BMI as well and throw it in there. Now, of course,   |
| 41:09      | BMI is one of those things. It's not hugely accurate to actually track how healthy and fit you are,    |
| 41:15      | but it's another data point. And I get it for free because I'm using my shortcut and it wasn't a       |
| 41:20      | lot of work to add that. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. And you know, it's always interesting to have        |
| 41:26      | an extra data point even if you then don't do anything with it. In general, I tend to ignore           |
| 41:30      | it, but I like to know that it's there for me. That's about it for me and automation on health         |
| 41:36      | and fitness. You got anything else? I think that's pretty much it as well. It's one of these things.   |
| 41:42      | I've also been trying mood path, which is more for checking your mental health than your moods.        |
| 41:47      | And this is something I heard recommended on [[Cortex]]. [[Myke Hurley]] recommended it. And this,             |
| 41:53      | as far as I'm aware, doesn't integrate with the health application, but it does prompt you at          |
| 41:59      | multiple times of the day to track how you're doing with your mood. And the more data you give         |
| 42:04      | it, of course, the more accurate it is and the better recommendations it can make for you. So          |
| 42:09      | I've been trying this since about December 4th, it seems. And it's getting to the point where it       |
| 42:15      | can start to give me statistics, but I have a few days every week where I fall off the radar and       |
| 42:20      | have to get back on. So I'm working on that. And that is the thing that prompts you at the end         |
| 42:25      | of the day, I assume. It actually prompts you three times a day so you can track how your mood         |
| 42:29      | changes throughout the day. So if you're happier in the morning than the evenings or the other way     |
| 42:34      | around or at lunchtime in my case, because I'm in the middle of eating a bar of chocolate,             |
| 42:38      | I tend to be in a very good mood, whereas I'm in a good mood the rest of the time,                     |
| 42:41      | unless I'm in the middle of podcasting with you, in which case it's a very good mood. So yes,          |
| 42:47      | but I'm liking this and I'll put a link to that app in the show notes as well. And it's an interesting |
| 42:53      | way of just tracking another data point. And of course, mental health is just as important as          |
| 42:59      | physical health. So what type of data does it give you? Do you find it helpful? Well, at the           |
| 43:04      | moment, I am just basically getting a little chart that shows my mood going up and down throughout     |
| 43:09      | the day, and then from day to week, and then week goes into months. But it's the questions that it     |
| 43:17      | asks you, which I am very interested in seeing the answers for. Because after 14 days of continuous    |
| 43:24      | assessment, you get a continuous question answering, then you get an assessment of your mental health. |
| 43:30      | And in general, I think I'm going to come out pretty well, I seem to be pretty happy whenever          |
| 43:34      | I'm using this. But they also have programs built in there. So you can have there's a course on        |
| 43:40      | understanding depression. There's two courses on mindfulness. There's a course on self confidence      |
| 43:47      | and a course on sleep. I should probably do the course on sleep, because I've been struggling          |
| 43:51      | with that a little bit. So it has a journal, and then there's the results. And under the               |
| 43:57      | Discover tab, that's where they have courses that you can read and listen to. Another one,             |
| 44:02      | I guess health related. And if you listen to Focus, you've heard me yammer on about meditation, but    |
| 44:08      | I've done it for over 20 years, almost 30 years now. So it's very useful to me, but I don't have       |
| 44:14      | any automation involved. I have an app that I press as a timer because it has nice chimes.             |
| 44:20      | But I don't need an app to tell me when I know when to do it, and I do it. So it's there's really      |
| 44:25      | not a whole lot of automation involved. But that's a good example of a habit. If you're trying to      |
| 44:28      | start to get something to remind you to do it, either with just a shortcut based reminder,             |
| 44:35      | or there's a lot of app based automation. Some of the some of the more popular meditation apps         |
| 44:41      | will actually tell you once a day, Hey, I'm a meditated, you want to do that now? So                   |
| 44:45      | so you can you can do solve that problem several ways if that's something you're trying to get         |
| 44:49      | started on. Yes, that that's an interesting one. I've been trying, you know, not quite meditation,     |
| 44:56      | but definitely the breathing exercises with the Apple Watch. And that's definitely interesting.        |
| 45:02      | And I've been using streaks, actually, because the Apple Watch has a maximum number of minutes         |
| 45:06      | that you can do it for at once. And I'm finding 15 minutes is actually pretty good to help me          |
| 45:10      | go to sleep at night. But you can't actually do that with the Apple Watch. So I set the Apple Watch    |
| 45:16      | for as long as you can go. I think it was 10 minutes last time I tried. And then and then I            |
| 45:21      | set a streaks timer for 15 minutes for the habit. And then it locks it for me. Yeah,                   |
| 45:26      | if you wanted to try it, the one I would recommend for someone new to it would be headspace. I think   |
| 45:31      | they do a good job of kind of walking you through. Yes. And I've heard good things about them as       |
| 45:35      | well. And they will be linked in the show notes. This episode of Automators is brought to you by       |

| 46:51      | So Rose, you got any automation problems you've been solving lately?                                   |
| 46:55      | Yes, yes I have. So I've been driving myself insane for the last couple of months. Not                 |
| 47:00      | intentionally, but I have an automation to keep up my show macro. And whenever I plug my               |
| 47:07      | microphone setup into my MacBook Air, it pops up and it sets everything up to record automators.       |
| 47:13      | This was fabulous when I was only recording one podcast, but occasionally I record nested folders,     |
| 47:18      | another podcast that I host, or I record video and audio for screencasts online,                       |
| 47:23      | and I'm not going to go out and buy a different microphone for every single podcast that I record,     |
| 47:28      | or all the screencasts. So what I've done is I've reprogrammed my keyboard my show macro.              |
| 47:36      | It took way too long for me to get around to doing this, but I finally reprogrammed it.                |
| 47:40      | And now one of the things it does, so it pops up and gets me to check a couple of settings that are    |
| 47:46      | the same for the microphone every single time. And then it pops up a dialogue box that says,           |
| 47:51      | so what are you recording? And then this uses, this gives me the option to say that I'm recording      |
| 47:58      | automators, nested folders, screencasts online, or a guest podcast. And it sets things up with         |
| 48:04      | the right applications depending on which option I pick. And this has been so useful because I was     |
| 48:10      | starting to go a little bit insane with the opening [[Skype]] every single time, when I actually needed    |
| 48:16      | [[FaceTime]], for example, or I was going to use ZenCast or something, or just [[Audio Hijack]] and            |
| 48:22      | [[ScreenFlow]]. So I'm very pleased to have actually found a solution that does not drive me up the        |
| 48:28      | wall. Yeah, the old problem of getting the audio files to the editor and everything related to it.     |
| 48:35      | Yes, exactly. Because I have different sessions in [[Audio Hijack]] as well that I use. That's the         |
| 48:39      | next step that I want to automate, making sure that the correct sessions are opened with [[Audio Hijack]]  |
| 48:45      | for whichever podcast I'm recording. And that's something I haven't done yet. And I'm still            |
| 48:50      | looking at ways to do that. It's an interesting rabbit hole when you've got something you do           |
| 48:55      | every week on your computer, and it doesn't take long to manually do it. But you want the automation   |
| 49:00      | not only just for making it faster, but making it more accurate, making sure it gets to the right      |
| 49:05      | place. But then you know that it could be so much better if only you could get the episode number in   |
| 49:11      | or whatever the particular problem that you're trying to solve is. And it's funny how you can          |
| 49:17      | really get lost on getting it from acceptable to awesome. That is an automator problem for all of      |
| 49:28      | us. Yes. And I have to say, my previous solution was not acceptable. It was definitely very acceptable |
| 49:34      | when I started, when we first started with automators. And I was very happy with it. But it            |
| 49:39      | quickly got to the point where I was getting grumpy with my automation because I'd have to             |
| 49:43      | wait for [[Skype]] to finish launching and then quit [[Skype]] so that I could open Zoom or ZenCaster or       |
| 49:51      | [[FaceTime]] Audio and things like that. So that was less than ideal. But that is now finally fixed.       |
| 49:57      | So I'm very pleased about that. And I'll put a little bit of documentation in the show notes           |
| 50:02      | to exactly what gets done. And specifically how I use the alert in audio in [[Keyboard Maestro]] to        |
| 50:10      | let me choose those different options. Yeah. Something that's made me really happy lately              |
| 50:15      | with automation is some of my document automation. And I was just looking, I don't think we've done    |
| 50:19      | a show on automating Word and pages. Maybe we'll have to do a show on it at some point. But it         |
| 50:24      | sounds like a plan. I've got a lot of really hacky automation I've put together. I covered this        |
| 50:30      | in the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide. So some people may already be aware of some of this. But          |
| 50:34      | there is really no simple way to template out Word and pages. On the window side, there are            |
| 50:42      | document generation applications built for this. And they just really aren't any on the Mac.           |
| 50:47      | So I made my own. And what I've done is I've made these document templates like as a lawyer,           |
| 50:53      | I have a certain type of corporate document that I need once in a while. And what I do is I put        |
| 51:00      | wildcards in the document where I need to replace them. It's like the name of the company and the      |
| 51:05      | amount of the shares or whatever. But you also have wildcards for like him versus her and his          |
| 51:13      | versus hers. You have to think about all the different things that can change. And then I've           |
| 51:17      | created a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script. When I trigger it, it gives me a menu of all the variables. So      |
| 51:23      | I can just type them in in one screen. And then once I hit go, it goes, it grabs the template          |
| 51:30      | document. And then it makes a copy of it. And the way it does it is and all of these, you know,        |
| 51:37      | this is just a very tricky script. So you open the document. And then you pause for two and a          |
| 51:44      | half seconds, because that's what you always do with [[Keyboard Maestro]] is you pause, you know,          |
| 51:49      | but then I do a command, a keyboard command shift command s, which is the save as command in pages.    |
| 51:56      | And fortunately, when you do it, it already highlights the name field for the save as so               |
| 52:03      | then I can, I can take some of the variables and I can rename the document using those variables.      |
| 52:07      | So very first thing is I make a copy of the template. And then it's a rinse and repeat on              |
| 52:13      | the search and replace. But again, it's, it's, you know, very particular keyboard commands,            |
| 52:18      | like I use command f within pages will work. So long as you have the last time you ran it,             |
| 52:24      | you had search and replace and not just search. Right. And, and then what's so once you do that,       |
| 52:28      | then you can, you know, so as long as you've got the adequate number of pauses, you look for certain   |
| 52:33      | terms, you know, of your wild cards you put in the document. And then you place in the variables       |
| 52:39      | that the users typed in. And then you, you know, you do it for as many variables as you have.          |
| 52:44      | And at the end, you have a customised document. It's quite a bit of work to do at the first time.      |
| 52:49      | And, you know, now that I figured out how to do it, it's, it's not that hard. But just recently,       |
| 52:54      | I've had a bunch, atypically for me, I've had a bunch of the same type of things I've been doing,      |
| 53:00      | usually with my clients, everything is different, but I've been able to actually use some of these     |
| 53:05      | templates. And man, is it nice being able to do that. Oh yeah, I can believe that. So I've been        |
| 53:10      | trying to make templates for the shows that I've been doing for Screencast Online. And the problem     |
| 53:16      | with Screencast Online is every show is different. So I can't really template things. But I've been    |
| 53:21      | working on a little outline automation, which I will hopefully be able to share in a future episode.   |
| 53:25      | But automating your documents is good. We're going to have to come back to this in a future            |
| 53:29      | episode and do a whole episode on it. Yeah, like Microsoft Word is much more difficult to pull         |
| 53:35      | this off because it changes the window focus to the search. I've got a solution, but it's,             |
| 53:43      | we'd need another 30 minutes for me to explain it. So what we'll do is show on it at some point.       |
| 53:46      | But, but the, you can do it in different applications, but the document automation                     |
| 53:51      | has been delighting me lately. It's fun. You press the button. And because I have so many              |
| 53:56      | pauses in it, it's not immediate, it takes about, you know, about 30 seconds to generate it. But       |
| 54:01      | it's kind of fun to just watch the screen, zip around and generate these documents for you.            |
| 54:06      | And this is why you don't really need a virtual system because you program                             |
| 54:10      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] to be your virtual assistant instead.                                                 |
| 54:12      | Yeah, that is a thing that you typically would pay a virtual assistant to do,                          |
| 54:16      | that you'd give them the information they generate the document for you. And it's a good               |
| 54:20      | example of where I don't need a virtual assistant to do that. It just, just happens for me. And        |
| 54:25      | it's much faster. Yes.                                                                                 |
| 54:26      | And it's more accurate because it's automation based. So there's, there's some real love in that       |
| 54:32      | for me. So, so what we'll do is show on that at some point. And if you're interested,                  |
| 54:36      | let us know in the forums the problems you have with document automation. We'll make sure we cover     |
| 54:40      | that. One other thing I wanted to talk about in today's show is our friend [[Adam Tow]] has released       |
| 54:47      | an app and automators should be aware of it. It's called Launch Cuts. And this solves the problem      |
| 54:54      | with shortcuts of people like us have is there's too many shortcuts and there's no                     |
| 54:59      | folder organisation. Yeah.                                                                             |
| 55:00      | So Launch Cuts is just kind of an ingenious way to take, it gets, it looks at your shortcuts           |
| 55:07      | library and gets all the names out of it, and then allows you to organise them within folders.         |
| 55:12      | So it's like a, it's kind of a launcher for shortcuts, but it just adds a bunch of features            |
| 55:17      | that [[Apple]] hasn't got around to.                                                                       |
| 55:19      | Yes. And this is so useful. So I finally managed to get all of my shortcuts for screen                 |
| 55:23      | accounts online in one folder and automators in one folder and the suite set up in one                 |
| 55:27      | folder. And it's so nice to have like those 10 shortcuts together, not scattered around                |
| 55:34      | because the sync broke on me again and all of my shortcuts got rearranged.                             |
| 55:39      | And so really, yeah. Well, this happened some time ago and I'm still trying to find out exactly        |
| 55:45      | when things went wrong the last time, because all of my shortcuts keep changing order. And I'm,        |
| 55:51      | I'm not sure if I'm imagining things or if they are actually changing order on me.                     |
| 55:57      | And it's a little bit confusing. But with Launch Cuts, I don't need to worry because                   |
| 56:02      | there's all sorts. And I also really enjoy going through my shortcuts organised by colour.              |
| 56:08      | I don't know why it's just very soothing to scroll through and see how many shortcuts I have in        |
| 56:12      | different colours.                                                                                      |
| 56:13      | Yeah, I've got a really nutty system with icons and colours. And then as soon as I got                  |
| 56:17      | Launch Cuts installed, I'm like, oh yeah, this is, this is the way it should be.                       |
| 56:21      | Yes, exactly. And it's great because you can also, it's even got smart folders rather for,             |
| 56:28      | for checking what you can share. So if you could share a date to something or if it's tagged with      |
| 56:33      | music and the way that it works is absolutely amazing. So I would highly encourage people to           |
| 56:39      | check that one out.                                                                                    |
| 56:40      | And Adam is just one of us. I mean, he's been adding so many interesting shortcuts                     |
| 56:45      | to the community and been super involved with trying to push the ball forward on what you              |
| 56:50      | can do with shortcuts. I like giving him a little support. Anyway, he's got a website.                 |
| 56:55      | I think it's toe.com. That's from memory. So I guess let me check that real quick before               |
| 57:01      | before I finish that. Yeah, toe.com. And he does a lot of cool stuff on there.                         |
| 57:06      | And I recommend go and check it out. And congratulations, Adam, getting that launched.                 |
| 57:11      | Yes. And it's really interesting to see the number of shortcuts, utilities,                            |
| 57:15      | applications that are popping up that maybe more topic for, more topics for future shows there.        |
| 57:21      | And yeah, we'll have to see what we can do with that.                                                  |
| 57:24      | I agree. In the meantime, we are the automators. You can find us over at relay.fm/automators.    |

| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this                    |
| 00:06      | is Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for                 |
| 00:11      | you.                                                                                                   |
| 00:12      | Hello, Rosemary Orchard.                                                                               |
| 00:13      | Hello, David Sparks.                                                                                   |
| 00:14      | How are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:15      | Excellent.                                                                                             |
| 00:16      | We are on the cusp of getting shortcuts with iOS 13.                                                   |
| 00:20      | So excited.                                                                                            |
| 00:21      | We're on the cusp of getting new iPhones as well.                                                      |
| 00:23      | It's kind of crazy.                                                                                    |
| 00:24      | Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on.                                                                 |
| 00:25      | Is your cook going to work on those new iPhones?                                                       |
| 00:26      | It better.                                                                                             |
| 00:27      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 00:28      | It better.                                                                                             |
| 00:29      | If it doesn't, I'm going to be very upset because there was an Apple event this week,                  |
| 00:34      | and there are lots of new Chinese, including some things that we weren't expecting like                |
| 00:38      | an iPad, which is apparently a thing.                                                                  |
| 00:42      | Can I just say, I mean, this show is not about hardware stuff, but the iPad for $329, that             |
| 00:49      | may be the best deal Apple has.                                                                        |
| 00:51      | I mean, that is a great iPad for $300.                                                                 |
| 00:55      | I feel that it is actually relevant to our show because there are a lot of people listening            |
| 00:59      | and I see a lot of people in the forums who have only got an iPhone, and they're trying                |
| 01:03      | to build these amazing and complex shortcuts, but it's difficult when you just don't have              |
| 01:07      | the screen space.                                                                                      |
| 01:09      | And so if that's been new and you've been playing with things like Scriptable and shortcuts            |
| 01:14      | and stuff like that, this could be a great opportunity to go get now a 10.2 inch screen                |
| 01:20      | instead of a 9.7, which is a whole an extra half an inch in pretty much the same body                  |
| 01:27      | size.                                                                                                  |
| 01:28      | So I don't know, I feel like it is relevant for our listeners, at least somewhat.                      |
| 01:32      | And you could have bought three of them for what I paid for my iPad Pro.                               |
| 01:35      | It's just bananas.                                                                                     |
| 01:36      | You know, I mean, it's crazy.                                                                          |
| 01:39      | And like it has keyboard support, it has Apple Pencil support.                                         |
| 01:41      | I was talking to my wife and kids, I was thinking, you know, there's a lot of people in our            |
| 01:46      | family that are not high-end computer users and with iOS 13's new [[Safari]] that works with               |
| 01:53      | just about everything.                                                                                 |
| 01:54      | I mean, it works with my banking website, it works with Squarespace.                                   |
| 01:57      | All the stuff that it didn't work with before for me, it's worked for.                                 |
| 02:01      | I was thinking this is something we can really recommend to non-supergeek friends as they're           |
| 02:08      | computing device now.                                                                                  |
| 02:10      | And for $329, they're done, which is really a good deal to get into some Apple hardware.               |
| 02:16      | So anyway, I didn't mean, I think that's not in the outline, I just kind of fell into that.            |
| 02:20      | But I do want to talk a little bit about the hardware because it happened this week.                   |
| 02:25      | You and I were text messaging each other as I was going down, so Rose, what's the damage               |
| 02:30      | on your end?                                                                                           |
| 02:31      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 02:32      | It could have been worse.                                                                              |
| 02:34      | They could have also announced the tracking thingy, which I would totally have thought.                |
| 02:39      | But as it is, I've already ordered an Apple Watch.                                                     |
| 02:42      | It is arriving on release day and I will be getting an iPhone 11 Pro, not the Max, because             |
| 02:50      | I currently have the Max and I drop it somewhat frequently and I feel like it didn't drop              |
| 02:54      | my 10 and you went near as much.                                                                       |
| 02:56      | So I'm going back to the smaller size, but I'm debating colour-wise.                                    |
| 03:00      | What are you doing?                                                                                    |
| 03:01      | Well, I get a new phone every year.                                                                    |
| 03:03      | That's probably one of my biggest luxuries in life is I always get the new one.                        |
| 03:07      | We have whole thing in the family.                                                                     |
| 03:09      | My kids have already texted me that, you know, dad, you're getting the new one, right, dad?            |
| 03:14      | Right?                                                                                                 |
| 03:15      | Because they're already making their plans as mine gets handed down.                                   |
| 03:18      | I'm definitely getting the green one.                                                                  |
| 03:21      | I always have this thing like, do I get the white one?                                                 |
| 03:24      | Do I get the black one?                                                                                |
| 03:25      | I can never make up my mind.                                                                           |
| 03:26      | I just like that.                                                                                      |
| 03:27      | It's different.                                                                                        |
| 03:28      | I really like the colour green.                                                                         |
| 03:29      | Kind of reminds me.                                                                                    |
| 03:30      | I think it's an appropriate colour for a Star Wars Rebel, you know, the green kind of olive             |
| 03:36      | green that they have.                                                                                  |
| 03:37      | So I approve.                                                                                          |
| 03:39      | I'm getting the green one and I'm probably getting the Max.                                            |
| 03:42      | I have the Max now.                                                                                    |
| 03:43      | I don't feel like I'm, I don't think it's too big if it's in all my pockets.                           |
| 03:48      | I'll probably just get the Max again and that's going to definitely happen.                            |
| 03:53      | And also I'm getting ready to start up a photos field guide.                                           |
| 03:55      | I want to use those three lenses to do some examples in that book.                                     |
| 04:00      | But the thing that got me in the presentation was the watch because I knew I did not need              |
| 04:07      | a new watch.                                                                                           |
| 04:08      | I have a nice Apple watch and it's like, it's funny when they say always on how fast                   |
| 04:14      | the switch flipped in my brain.                                                                        |
| 04:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:18      | I have seen a couple of people talking about some of the automation possibilities.                     |
| 04:22      | Somebody suggested that maybe the new watches can read NFC tags.                                       |
| 04:25      | I should point out this is totally unfounded, but if it could, that would be super awesome             |
| 04:29      | as a way to trigger shortcuts.                                                                         |
| 04:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:32      | We're going to talk about NFC today.                                                                   |
| 04:34      | We have a whole segment about NFC later, but the, but I probably will go and I have                    |
| 04:39      | not ordered yet.                                                                                       |
| 04:40      | I'm probably going to just go in the store and look at the, the different configurations.              |
| 04:45      | I'm not, I don't need to have it on day one.                                                           |
| 04:47      | So.                                                                                                    |
| 04:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:49      | Well, they have this new customiser online, which is really cool, but it doesn't work                  |
| 04:52      | in Austria.                                                                                            |
| 04:53      | So I've just ordered the basic aluminum one with another white sports band.                            |
| 04:57      | I'm, I'm building a nice collection of those now.                                                      |
| 05:01      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 05:02      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 05:03      | So we spent our money.                                                                                 |
| 05:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:06      | Along with hardware, we get some software, which means that it's confusing.                            |
| 05:11      | There are different dates when we get different things because iOS 13 is coming out on September       |
| 05:16      | 19th.                                                                                                  |
| 05:18      | And then iPadOS comes out on September 30th, which looks like it's going to be the 13.1                |
| 05:23      | release for iOS as well.                                                                               |
| 05:25      | And everything's a little bit off.                                                                     |
| 05:27      | So do you know what this means for shortcuts?                                                          |
| 05:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:30      | Well, it means that the, remember those triggers we were so excited about when we were talking,        |
| 05:36      | we had the microphones propped on my shoes at the, at a WWDZ.                                          |
| 05:42      | Now we are going to get that a couple of weeks later than we thought we would.                         |
| 05:45      | So you're going to get the new shortcuts with the release.                                             |
| 05:49      | In fact, this show is publishing a week, a week after the show publishes, you're going                 |
| 05:53      | to get the new 13.0.                                                                                   |
| 05:56      | And that's great.                                                                                      |
| 05:57      | Download it, enjoy it.                                                                                 |
| 05:58      | It's awesome.                                                                                          |
| 05:59      | And the new short, there's a lot in the new shortcuts that has nothing to do with the                  |
| 06:02      | new triggers that you're going to love.                                                                |
| 06:04      | And we're going to talk about that kind of through today's show, like, you know, the                   |
| 06:07      | tokens and the new, the new programming model.                                                         |
| 06:11      | But then a week and a half later, you get the 13.1 update that's going to add all those                |
| 06:16      | cool triggers and we're going to talk about those today too.                                           |
| 06:18      | So it's all coming, it's coming relatively quickly and it's fine with me that the triggers             |
| 06:24      | got pushed back to the 13.1.                                                                           |
| 06:26      | I'm glad that they've announced that the date of release of 13.1 is the end of September,              |
| 06:31      | which means we aren't going to have to wait very long.                                                 |
| 06:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 06:34      | Yeah, that's good.                                                                                     |
| 06:35      | I do pity any and all developers out there who have now got stuff that is theoretically                |
| 06:40      | a 13 release, but it's for an iPad.                                                                    |
| 06:42      | So what do they do because iPad doesn't get it yet and it's, it's very confusing as to                 |
| 06:48      | what's happening.                                                                                      |
| 06:49      | So hopefully Apple is going to guide us through this and it won't be too insane.                       |
| 06:53      | But if it is, then just spend two weeks playing with automations and install the public page           |
| 06:58      | on your iPad.                                                                                          |
| 06:59      | Maybe if that's a, if that's a big problem for you.                                                    |
| 07:02      | And my understanding is that this is going to 13.1 is going to be across the board.                    |
| 07:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:09      | But it's going to, so it's just 11 days later.                                                         |
| 07:12      | It's not the end of the world.                                                                         |
| 07:13      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                       |
| 07:15      | So let's, before we take a look at the new shortcuts, I think it would be a good moment                |
| 07:21      | to talk about September because September is a childhood cancer awareness month.                       |
| 07:26      | And this year, really a fan actually has an official partnership with St. Jude, which                  |
| 07:30      | is the children's research hospital.                                                                   |
| 07:33      | And it does amazing things all around the world.                                                       |
| 07:38      | And they are actually partnered with organisations such as the World Health Organisation who           |
| 07:42      | are committed to transforming health, uh, cancer care with the goal of curing at least                 |
| 07:46      | 60% of children worldwide with six of the most common cancers by 2030.                                 |
| 07:51      | And childhood cancer is obviously something that is not something anybody wants to experience.         |
| 07:58      | Unfortunately, in the relay family, [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen Hackett's]] son did have cancer and St. Jude                 |
| 08:03      | helped cure his child.                                                                                 |
| 08:05      | And we are trying to raise money for St. Jude, not just for Stephen's family, but also for             |
| 08:10      | everybody who can benefit from this research because this research is shared everywhere.               |
| 08:16      | And as part of this, we actually have a special URL, which is stjude.org/automators.             |
| 08:22      | And if you donate money, then you will actually be helping St. Jude stay true to its life-saving       |
| 08:27      | mission, which is finding cures and saving children.                                                   |
| 08:30      | And so you can actually donate to support childhood cancer at stjude.org/automators.             |
| 08:37      | But as well as this, [[Stephen Hackett]] and [[Myke Hurley]] are doing a marathon podcastathon.                |
| 08:43      | This is on September 20th, so this will be iPhone release day and iOS release day.                     |
| 08:48      | And you can watch them do amazing things on the internet.                                              |
| 08:52      | So you should check that out on the Relay FM blog.                                                     |
| 08:55      | They've got all the information up there.                                                              |
| 08:57      | And it is a great cause that we should all think about helping, especially as some of                  |
| 09:02      | us are dropping large amounts of money on technology this month.                                       |
| 09:04      | So I know I'm going to be making my donation as well.                                                  |
| 09:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 09:07      | And you know what?                                                                                     |
| 09:08      | If you figure out how to automate your domination to St. Jude, send me some kind of proof of           |
| 09:13      | that and I will send you some stickers because I think that's cool.                                    |
| 09:16      | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 09:17      | Automators should automate donations, right?                                                           |
| 09:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 09:21      | Well, you could set it up on a monthly cycle if you really want to.                                    |
| 09:24      | Well, no, I was thinking like, you know, maybe a [[Keyboard Maestro]]'s script on the web page.            |
| 09:29      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 09:30      | I bet you could do it.                                                                                 |
| 09:31      | Somebody in the forums is going to come up with something great of that, I'm sure.                     |
| 09:35      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 09:36      | Great.                                                                                                 |
| 09:37      | So another thing that happened last month is that was the Relay 5th anniversary.                       |
| 09:43      | And we did a really fun thing, Rose and I got to spend time together up in San Francisco.              |
| 09:48      | They did a family feud network wide game in San Francisco.                                             |
| 09:53      | The thing got videotaped, the videotape looks great.                                                   |
| 09:56      | It's now on YouTube.                                                                                   |
| 09:57      | We'll put a link in the show notes.                                                                    |
| 09:59      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 10:00      | And I should point out for people that haven't watched or listened to this yet, David and              |
| 10:05      | I's teams went into the finals head to head.                                                           |
| 10:08      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 10:09      | And I'm not going to tell you who won.                                                                 |
| 10:10      | So you're going to have to listen and find out who crushed who.                                        |
| 10:13      | The other thing that happened when we were in San Francisco, and honestly, this was probably           |
| 10:16      | the highlight of my trip.                                                                              |
| 10:18      | We hung out with [[Sal Soghoian]] and Naomi and we did a game of mousetrap.                                 |
| 10:24      | It was the members only podcast for the Automators.                                                    |
| 10:29      | And I honestly think that was one of the best ones on the network this year.                           |
| 10:34      | It was definitely great fun.                                                                           |
| 10:35      | So if you haven't listened to our members episode, then you should definitely check that               |
| 10:39      | out.                                                                                                   |
| 10:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:41      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 10:42      | Well, that was a lot of information.                                                                   |
| 10:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:44      | But it is September and September does tend to come with a lot of information, not just                |
| 10:48      | for people going back to school, but for people who are starting short cut school.                     |
| 10:52      | Right, David?                                                                                          |
| 10:53      | Yes, Rosemary.                                                                                         |
| 10:55      | So let's just talk, you know, we've covered shortcuts a few times the last several months,             |
| 11:00      | but you know, it's just the season for that.                                                           |
| 11:01      | So hang in there with us.                                                                              |
| 11:02      | And there's been, you know, the ball has been moving quite a bit.                                      |
| 11:06      | But you know, as we approach launch, where are we with shortcuts?                                      |
| 11:09      | You know, what did we get and what did we not get?                                                     |
| 11:13      | We've already covered the fact that triggers are going to be a little late, but the new                |
| 11:16      | program.                                                                                               |
| 11:17      | They're coming.                                                                                        |
| 11:18      | Yeah, they are coming.                                                                                 |
| 11:19      | And this new programming model is, I mean, this is the reason why, and I guess another                 |
| 11:23      | thing I should say is I'm releasing a new shortcuts field guide.                                       |
| 11:26      | It's a, if as I record this show, there's still some post production to be done, but                   |
| 11:31      | there are 106 videos and over five and a half hours.                                                   |
| 11:34      | It's crazy how much material there is.                                                                 |
| 11:38      | And the reason I had to do a new one is because they changed so much and really, I would say           |
| 11:44      | at this point, having spent north of 130 hours working on this field guide, everything that            |
| 11:51      | they did is for the better.                                                                            |
| 11:52      | I mean, shortcuts is so much more accessible now.                                                      |
| 11:56      | And one of the most important things that they changed with this new version, which you're             |
| 12:01      | going to get with the release of iOS 13 is the new programming model.                                  |
| 12:06      | I guess the easiest way to describe it is, is consolidation.                                           |
| 12:11      | So it used to be that it was very much a traditional programming model where there was the declaration |
| 12:19      | of verbs or I guess of variables, which I would call, you know, nouns, and then there                  |
| 12:24      | was actions on those, which we would call verbs, but everything was separate, you know,                |
| 12:28      | like you would have the verb would be one action, the noun would be a separate action.                 |
| 12:34      | And sometimes they'd be in different locations in the shortcut.                                        |
| 12:37      | And sometimes even if you thought you understood this stuff, the verb would act on a different         |
| 12:44      | noun than you expected.                                                                                |
| 12:46      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 12:47      | Does that make sense?                                                                                  |
| 12:48      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 12:49      | And also, just because of the way things were set up, it was really easy to accidentally               |
| 12:52      | break your shortcut by picking up your phone and having your fingers drag across the screen            |
| 12:56      | and move some of the action blocks around, which is so much more difficult to do now.                  |
| 13:00      | It's still possible, but it's much more difficult to do because things are consolidated together.      |
| 13:05      | So instead of, you know, having text and then having a replaced text action, you replace               |
| 13:10      | text in, and then either the text itself is there or it's a variable pointing to that                  |
| 13:17      | text, which means that if the text, you know, is like six blocks up, then it still works               |
| 13:23      | just as well as if it's one block above it.                                                            |
| 13:27      | So I personally find it's much more user-friendly.                                                     |
| 13:31      | And so to finish the analogy, they've put the whole sentence in one block now.                         |
| 13:35      | The noun and the verb are together.                                                                    |
| 13:36      | So the benefit of that is it's much easier to understand what you're doing when you make               |
| 13:42      | the shortcuts.                                                                                         |
| 13:43      | And they've added a whole bunch of power with this.                                                    |
| 13:46      | And I think this is going to make shortcuts even more accessible to people who found it                |
| 13:51      | a little difficult in the past.                                                                        |
| 13:54      | Another huge thing they did was now it's part of the OS.                                               |
| 13:57      | So everybody who owns an iPhone and an iPad as of September 30th is going to have shortcuts            |
| 14:04      | installed on their device.                                                                             |
| 14:05      | So we're going to have this hopefully big growth of the user base.                                     |
| 14:09      | So people are going to be able to really take advantage of this and hopefully start playing            |
| 14:14      | with it.                                                                                               |
| 14:15      | That's a great thing for automation.                                                                   |
| 14:16      | Yeah, which means that probably a lot of our listeners are going to be getting phone calls             |
| 14:19      | from relatives going, what is this shortcut saying and why did it appear on my home screen?            |
| 14:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:24      | And my homework for everybody listening is to prepare like a two sentence, this is an                  |
| 14:29      | amazing app.                                                                                           |
| 14:30      | You can use it to make this ultimately happen when that does stuff, answer for your relatives          |
| 14:36      | that they will get and that they can apply and understand because the more people that                 |
| 14:39      | use this, the more Apple is going to actually give resources to the shortcuts team.                    |
| 14:44      | And that's what we want at the end of the day, automation to be a key thing at Apple.                  |
| 14:48      | You can also point them in my field guide, just saying, right?                                         |
| 14:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:52      | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 14:53      | So these grandmas looking to get started for the first time, I'm thinking they may need                |
| 14:57      | like a two sentence hook to get them there and then they're going to buy your shortcuts.               |
| 15:00      | Get them into the gallery.                                                                             |
| 15:02      | That's the trick, because in the gallery, they don't do any work and then they can play                |
| 15:05      | with it.                                                                                               |
| 15:06      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 15:07      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 15:08      | So the underlying programming model is different and I think that's, it's just such a, it's            |
| 15:14      | so obvious to me once I started using it like, oh yeah, this is the way it should have                 |
| 15:18      | always been.                                                                                           |
| 15:19      | You know how that, that goes, I didn't realise that, you know, in hindsight, it's obvious              |
| 15:24      | that that was kind of a problem of mixing the variables and the actions.                               |
| 15:29      | But now it's solved so elegantly that it's like, how come this wasn't the way, this                    |
| 15:34      | way from the beginning?                                                                                |
| 15:35      | Well, I mean, I think it was partially the way it was from the beginning because don't                 |
| 15:39      | forget we, you know, programmers built this and they were building it, I'm guessing for                |
| 15:45      | themselves to try and make using these [[URL Schemes]] easier.                                             |
| 15:50      | But you have to start from somewhere.                                                                  |
| 15:52      | And I think maybe if they'd started, you know, with the model they have today in their head,           |
| 15:57      | we wouldn't have got shortcuts because it's not going to be easy to combine all of these               |
| 16:03      | steps together.                                                                                        |
| 16:04      | Whereas by breaking it up as they did start with, they also got to see how people use it               |
| 16:07      | and what people are really doing.                                                                      |
| 16:09      | And that's why you can now consolidate actions because you understand what people are doing            |
| 16:14      | with them.                                                                                             |
| 16:15      | Well, I want to talk about URL shortcuts and the future of shortcuts with [[URL Schemes]].                 |
| 16:21      | But before we do that, I want to take a minute to talk about our first sponsor today.                  |
| 16:25      | That's our friends over at Backblaze.                                                                  |
| 16:29      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Backblaze, the unlimited cloud backup for              |
| 16:33      | Macs and PCs that starts at just $6 a month.                                                           |
| 16:38      | There's no gimmicks, no add-ons, six bucks a month, and you're backed up.                              |
| 16:42      | I've been using Backblaze for many years.                                                              |
| 16:45      | In fact, we've just recorded an episode of Mac Power Users that'll, in fact, it just                   |
| 16:49      | came out before this show where we talked all about backup and Backblaze is a huge piece               |
| 16:53      | of that for me.                                                                                        |
| 16:56      | It's so difficult to have a reliable backup system where you have off-site storage when                |
| 17:03      | you try to roll it yourself, you know, it just doesn't work.                                           |
| 17:06      | It's, you don't keep it up to date, you forget to bring the drives, there's all these problems.        |
| 17:11      | Backblaze solves that for you.                                                                         |
| 17:12      | So if you've got Backblaze installed on your machine, it is always working, always backing             |
| 17:17      | up all of your devices to the cloud.                                                                   |
| 17:20      | Backblaze backs up documents, music, photos, videos, drawings, projects, everything that's             |
| 17:24      | important to you.                                                                                      |
| 17:26      | Sometimes you need access to a file on the go.                                                         |
| 17:29      | You can use their super easy mobile apps to access all your data anywhere in the cloud,                |
| 17:33      | even from your phone.                                                                                  |
| 17:34      | I was in Hawaii once and I had a client needed a contract thing.                                       |
| 17:38      | I got it off my Backblaze backup.                                                                      |
| 17:40      | No problem with my phone.                                                                              |
| 17:43      | Backblaze has backed up 750 petabytes, Rose, I don't even know what a petabyte is.                     |
| 17:48      | I think it's a lot.                                                                                    |
| 17:49      | Lots of data.                                                                                          |
| 17:50      | Yeah, there's lots of ones and zeros.                                                                  |
| 17:53      | That's equivalent.                                                                                     |
| 17:54      | Oh, here we go.                                                                                        |
| 17:55      | It's equivalent to 750 million gigabytes.                                                              |
| 17:57      | That's a lot of gigabytes, you know, million here, million there.                                      |
| 18:01      | These guys know their stuff.                                                                           |
| 18:02      | If you did have a data disaster, Backblaze can ship you a hard drive with all your data                |
| 18:07      | on it.                                                                                                 |
| 18:08      | If you've restored your precious documents, you can send the hard drive back for a full                |
| 18:13      | refund.                                                                                                |
| 18:14      | Backblaze has restored over 40 billion files.                                                          |
| 18:17      | That's a lot of saved projects, assignments and family photo albums.                                   |
| 18:21      | I once saw somebody in the Apple store who lost all their pictures and it was just crushing            |
| 18:28      | watching her sit there.                                                                                |
| 18:29      | She was crying silently.                                                                               |
| 18:31      | I felt so bad for her.                                                                                 |
| 18:33      | Anyway, having backup means total peace of mind.                                                       |
| 18:36      | It's the difference between a data disaster costing you hours of work and just having                  |
| 18:41      | a hard drive shipped to you.                                                                           |
| 18:43      | So get your stuff backed up through Backblaze.                                                         |
| 18:48      | Back up your stuff, guys.                                                                              |
| 18:49      | Go to backblaze.com/automators for your fully featured 15-day free trial and let them            |
| 18:56      | know you heard about them here on the automators.                                                      |
| 18:59      | That's backblaze.com/automators.                                                                 |
| 19:01      | Do it today, six bucks a month.                                                                        |
| 19:04      | You've got protection.                                                                                 |
| 19:06      | You should have it.                                                                                    |
| 19:07      | I have it.                                                                                             |
| 19:08      | Rose has it.                                                                                           |
| 19:09      | You need it.                                                                                           |
| 19:10      | Thank you, Backblaze, for sponsoring us and saving us countless data disasters.                        |
| 19:15      | And also, thanks for your support of all of Relay FM.                                                  |
| 19:19      | So we got a bunch of new stuff in shortcuts, some of which, unfortunately, from the early              |
| 19:25      | basis has disappeared, but there are still a bunch of new actions involved and things                  |
| 19:30      | that you can test the status of in shortcuts that we couldn't do in iOS 12, which I'm finding          |
| 19:36      | is amazing because, for example, if you create a new if action, then you can actually select           |
| 19:42      | a home accessory as an option.                                                                         |
| 19:44      | So I can say, if this lamp in this house is on, because I'm part of my parents' house                  |
| 19:49      | in the UK as well as my home here in Vienna, and I can say, hey, if this specific lamp                 |
| 19:54      | is on, then do this, which is amazing.                                                                 |
| 19:57      | And I had no idea I needed this.                                                                       |
| 19:59      | It turns out I really need this.                                                                       |
| 20:01      | So what things are you finding really useful, David?                                                   |
| 20:05      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 20:07      | Let's talk about that.                                                                                 |
| 20:08      | I definitely want to get back to that [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] question, though, because I think that's              |
| 20:11      | kind of important for the automator's audience, but we'll get to that.                                 |
| 20:16      | So there's so much to do with the new version.                                                         |
| 20:20      | Having used it now for quite a while, I really like these new automation triggers.                     |
| 20:25      | You want to talk about the app launch trigger first?                                                     |
| 20:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 20:28      | So the app launch trigger is actually something that I've been using more than I thought I               |
| 20:32      | would.                                                                                                 |
| 20:33      | So for example, whenever I launch the Kindle app or the [[Apple Books]] app, I talk or do not              |
| 20:38      | disturb them because I tend to only use these on my iPad mini, and I have other ways of                |
| 20:43      | getting notifications.                                                                                 |
| 20:44      | But it is so annoying to be sitting there reading and have, you got an email pop in at                 |
| 20:50      | the top of your screen.                                                                                |
| 20:52      | And I have cranked down my notifications quite a bit, but at the same time, I'm going on               |
| 20:58      | holiday next week, and I'm going to be sitting by the pool.                                            |
| 21:01      | I will not be wanting to see notifications about emails and stuff.                                     |
| 21:05      | Well, I'm just trying to read and relax.                                                               |
| 21:08      | So I've just automated that, and it's great because I just open the app and it happens.                |
| 21:14      | I think that the app launch trigger, it's interesting because when we were talking about this at         |
| 21:17      | [[WWDC]], we're like, well, what do you need that for?                                                     |
| 21:19      | And the best idea we could come up with was Timery that you would automatically fire off               |
| 21:24      | your Timers when you start something like the Open OmniFocus start your planning timer                 |
| 21:31      | or you open Ulysses start your writing timer, which is good, and that's a way to use it.               |
| 21:37      | But I kind of like Rose found that the idea of setting a context for an application is                 |
| 21:44      | something that I really like.                                                                          |
| 21:47      | And just like you were talking about, if you want to read, you want to turn on do not disturb.         |
| 21:52      | I like to turn on do not disturb when I start doing my planning.                                       |
| 21:55      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 21:56      | I've got specific time I sit down and try and figure out what I'm going to do with a day.              |
| 22:00      | There's nothing more annoying than having phone calls and interruptions while you're                   |
| 22:03      | doing that.                                                                                            |
| 22:05      | So I have said do not disturb on some of those things and using the trigger based on just              |
| 22:12      | launching the application makes that possible.                                                         |
| 22:15      | Maybe you're somebody who at the end of the day likes to wind down and watch YouTube.                  |
| 22:20      | You could turn on do not disturb when you open the YouTube app.                                        |
| 22:23      | It's really up to whatever your need is.                                                               |
| 22:27      | It's not just necessarily a productivity tool in that regard.                                          |
| 22:31      | But I do like the idea that I launch one app and I make something else happen.                         |
| 22:36      | Of all the triggers that we got, that's the one that I was scratching my head about at                 |
| 22:40      | the beginning, but now I totally get it.                                                               |
| 22:42      | So I actually stole something from you as well with the app launcher because you have                  |
| 22:46      | a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro for your Mac right where if you open Twitter, it gives you a                  |
| 22:49      | couple of minutes and then it tells you, you know, stop twittering, right?                             |
| 22:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:55      | Well, I actually did this.                                                                             |
| 22:56      | So I have, it's set to a number, so it waits for 60 seconds.                                           |
| 23:00      | And then after I've been on Twitter for 60 seconds, it opens OmniFocus, so I'm spending                |
| 23:05      | the last time on Twitter and I've done the same thing for [[Instagram]] as well and Facebook               |
| 23:11      | on my iPad.                                                                                            |
| 23:12      | I installed Facebook from my iPhone and a couple of other apps just because I'm finding                |
| 23:16      | that to be pretty useful because it's, they're going, hey, so you have some fun, but you're            |
| 23:22      | going to do this stuff, right?                                                                         |
| 23:24      | Like that's the whole point of this.                                                                   |
| 23:27      | So I'm finding that to be really useful.                                                               |
| 23:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:30      | It's like your phone is passive aggressive.                                                            |
| 23:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:33      | It's, and I can adjust it.                                                                             |
| 23:34      | I can turn this off, of course, but I'm finding it to be really useful because as much fun             |
| 23:39      | as spending time on social media is, I have a lot of things that I should be doing with                |
| 23:44      | my time, which sometimes they're not getting done.                                                     |
| 23:48      | And you know, I can, I can turn this off next week and then turn it back on when I get back            |
| 23:51      | from my holiday, but maybe I'll leave it on and maybe it'll be good for me to not spend                |
| 23:55      | so much time on social media.                                                                          |
| 23:57      | No, I think that's a great idea, Rose.                                                                 |
| 23:59      | I hadn't thought of that.                                                                              |
| 24:00      | So when you launch whatever your Twitter app of choice is, set a timer for 60 seconds and              |
| 24:06      | then launch a new app.                                                                                 |
| 24:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:08      | So I actually, this is a three action shortcut.                                                        |
| 24:10      | I've set, I've got a number for 60 because I can be able to tap the plus on the weight                 |
| 24:16      | so many times.                                                                                         |
| 24:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:18      | And then as a tip, by the way, the repeat action and the weight action and everything                  |
| 24:23      | with like a number, it kind of looks like you can't set a variable on it.                              |
| 24:28      | But if you just tap and hold on the number instead of tapping on it and then tapping                   |
| 24:33      | the plus, then you can select a magic variable or ask every time or an actual variable if              |
| 24:38      | you have one of those.                                                                                 |
| 24:39      | So I have it wait 60 seconds, so it just opens up a new focus and that's it.                           |
| 24:42      | Done.                                                                                                  |
| 24:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:44      | In fact, that's a tip that's usable throughout shortcuts.                                              |
| 24:48      | If you're having trouble turning something into a variable, tap and hold.                              |
| 24:52      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 24:54      | And actually this reminds me of something that I wanted to talk about, which was how                   |
| 25:00      | are you using automations?                                                                             |
| 25:03      | Because inside of the automations, like for example, the open Twitter, it then basically               |
| 25:08      | has a shortcuts building interface.                                                                    |
| 25:10      | But I found if I do this and I want to reuse it, like my kill Twitter shortcut, I can also             |
| 25:17      | use to kill [[Instagram]] and whatever else.                                                               |
| 25:19      | So I've turned it into the 60 second OmniFocus shortcut and then I just run my shortcut.               |
| 25:25      | Are you doing that or are you using actions directly in your automation?                               |
| 25:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 25:29      | I kind of went through that process.                                                                   |
| 25:32      | So the way these triggers were talking about work, once you've, if you've got it in front              |
| 25:37      | of you, at the bottom of shortcuts, there's three tabs.                                                |
| 25:41      | There's the gallery, there's your shortcuts, and then the middle is the automation stuff.              |
| 25:45      | The automation stuff, as I understand it, will not be there with the original release                  |
| 25:49      | file.                                                                                                  |
| 25:50      | It's 13.1.                                                                                             |
| 25:51      | So that's all I have.                                                                                  |
| 25:52      | It's 13.1.                                                                                             |
| 25:53      | But once you get that tab there, you tap that middle tab and it shows you these automation             |
| 25:57      | triggers.                                                                                              |
| 25:59      | But then, just like Ro said, you have the trigger that you create.                                     |
| 26:03      | Like the trigger would be when I launch the Twitter app.                                               |
| 26:06      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 26:07      | Then it allows you to add individual steps underneath it.                                              |
| 26:11      | But like Ro said, that's not really, I think, ideal.                                                   |
| 26:14      | The better way, what I do, after having played with this as well, is I create what I want              |
| 26:19      | it to do as a separate shortcut, you know, the, you know, the cancel Twitter and open                  |
| 26:25      | OmniFocus shortcut.                                                                                    |
| 26:27      | And then from within the automation trigger, I just run that shortcut.                                 |
| 26:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:34      | And I'm finding that to be much more useful as well, because unfortunately, for example,               |
| 26:38      | the run app shortcut, you can only choose one app.                                                     |
| 26:41      | So despite the fact that I've got maybe five apps that I want to do the same thing with,               |
| 26:45      | I have to create five automations, which is a point of improvement for iOS 14, FYI Apple.              |
| 26:50      | I will be sending feedback on this.                                                                    |
| 26:53      | But at the same time, it's quite useful because then if I decide, actually, I want to change           |
| 26:57      | this, I feel the 60 seconds is maybe a little too short.                                               |
| 27:00      | And I don't actually get to do what I wanted or needed to do.                                          |
| 27:06      | And I should change this to 90 seconds.                                                                |
| 27:07      | I changed that once and it's changed everywhere, which of course is the point of automation,           |
| 27:12      | because that's why we're here.                                                                         |
| 27:13      | We want to make our life simple, not complicated.                                                      |
| 27:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 27:17      | And shortcuts does not let you block and copy shortcut individual task items, like from                |
| 27:23      | one to the next, or even within the same shortcut.                                                     |
| 27:27      | And I did it, one of the videos in the new shortcuts field guide addresses this with                   |
| 27:31      | the idea of shortcuts, basically a subroutines, where you create small shortcuts that you              |
| 27:38      | access and other shortcuts by using the run shortcut command.                                          |
| 27:42      | And I did it like in the block scheduling stuff.                                                       |
| 27:44      | And there's different things you can do, but you should always keep your mind open to the              |
| 27:48      | idea of how often am I going to use this, and is this something that makes more sense                  |
| 27:55      | to break into an individual component that I can then call inside a shortcut as a run                  |
| 28:02      | shortcut subroutine.                                                                                   |
| 28:03      | Even like the timing stuff we were talking about earlier with Timer, he's a great app.                 |
| 28:08      | You can have it just run, you know, Timer has shortcut support.                                        |
| 28:14      | So you can say start my planning timer.                                                                |
| 28:17      | Now you can do that individually in the applications, but sometimes it's a little fiddly getting       |
| 28:24      | the Timer donation to show up.                                                                         |
| 28:27      | So the way I do it is I just created that as an individual shortcut.                                   |
| 28:31      | I think it's a one step shortcut, but it's there and it works.                                         |
| 28:37      | And then I call that in a variety of other contexts by just running that shortcut rather               |
| 28:41      | than trying to recreate that step in Timer every time I need it.                                       |
| 28:46      | And that way if it breaks, it breaks everywhere at once and I can fix it in one place.                 |
| 28:51      | And the whole idea of shortcuts as subroutines I think is something that folks need to wrap            |
| 28:56      | their heads around.                                                                                    |
| 28:57      | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 28:58      | Also, I would like to correct myself.                                                                  |
| 28:59      | I misspoke.                                                                                            |
| 29:00      | It is actually possible to select multiple applications as a trigger for the open app                  |
| 29:04      | shortcut.                                                                                              |
| 29:05      | So I am now super happy.                                                                               |
| 29:06      | I'm still using the run shortcut though.                                                               |
| 29:09      | As you can tell, we are playing as we record because yesterday was the Apple announcement,             |
| 29:15      | but that also meant that there were new betas.                                                         |
| 29:17      | And I've been trying to find out what actually works again.                                            |
| 29:20      | And I'm very excited to find out when that one works, so.                                              |
| 29:24      | There's been a lot of action on the shortcuts in the betas too.                                        |
| 29:28      | It's unlike other years.                                                                               |
| 29:31      | They have really been taking things out, putting things in.                                            |
| 29:35      | One of the things they added, the Rosemary Orchard feature is the shortcut now that                    |
| 29:39      | where you can automate the creation of iCloud links to your shortcuts.                                 |
| 29:45      | I love this feature so much.                                                                           |
| 29:46      | We'll put a link in the show notes to the blog post that I wrote on how to do this.                    |
| 29:50      | But essentially, you can use a shortcut to create links to shortcuts, which is so much                 |
| 29:56      | fun.                                                                                                   |
| 29:57      | And I really, really wanted, I must have requested this five or six times since workflow existed.      |
| 30:02      | And it's great because now I can stick all of my shortcuts in an air table and I can                   |
| 30:06      | delete my 900 shortcuts.                                                                               |
| 30:08      | But then what turns out something is missing, I can reinstall it.                                      |
| 30:12      | I used to do this with files and that doesn't work anymore with iOS 13 because it is a security        |
| 30:17      | risk, understandably so.                                                                               |
| 30:19      | Now, did you automate the donation to air table when you did that?                                     |
| 30:27      | So I have a base shortcut that I use for air table, but the way that the get contents                  |
| 30:36      | of URL works, it's not super easy to automate the content that goes inside it building that.           |
| 30:43      | So I have a lot of different air table shortcuts.                                                      |
| 30:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:47      | I mean, like I just did because with a field guide, I'm giving all the shortcuts I discuss             |
| 30:52      | away.                                                                                                  |
| 30:53      | So as you're watching the field guide, you can download the shortcut and play along.                   |
| 30:59      | I found that the easiest way to do it, honestly, I did it manually.                                    |
| 31:01      | I just sat in front of the TV and pressed the share button.                                            |
| 31:06      | But then you got to prove it and then I had it, but I had on my iPad and I had an Apple                |
| 31:11      | Notes document next to it and I've got all those links there so I can just go in and                   |
| 31:16      | pull anyone I want when I need to access them.                                                         |
| 31:20      | An interesting thing I noted, Rose, is you can't share the automatic triggers.                         |
| 31:25      | No, you can't.                                                                                         |
| 31:27      | So that's the other thing that you need to bear in mind with the automations.                          |
| 31:30      | If you're wanting to share this with somebody, you need to create as a shortcut so that you            |
| 31:34      | can share it because you can't share a trigger and that doesn't work.                                  |
| 31:39      | So, yes.                                                                                               |
| 31:40      | What about Wi-Fi triggers?                                                                             |
| 31:41      | That's another one that I was super excited about, so the idea that when your phone or                 |
| 31:46      | your iPad attaches to a different Wi-Fi network, something happens.                                    |
| 31:49      | Have you played with any of those?                                                                     |
| 31:51      | I have played with this and this is one of the triggers that a lot of people are instantly             |
| 31:55      | less happy about because it is a passive trigger, which means that your iPhone will connect            |
| 32:00      | to a Wi-Fi network automatically without asking you unless it's a new Wi-Fi network or it              |
| 32:05      | needs password or something, which means that you need to approve this trigger.                        |
| 32:09      | So I have been experimenting with a Rive Home trigger because I usually walk and having                |
| 32:18      | had a broken ankle at the beginning of the summer, I am walking a little bit slower even               |
| 32:21      | than I would usually, and the GPS triggers are just a little bit too far away and it's                 |
| 32:26      | slightly weird to be still a couple of minutes away from your home and you can see the lights          |
| 32:31      | turn on in your living room and you're not going to be in there front of the five minutes              |
| 32:34      | to turn them off or close the blinds.                                                                  |
| 32:37      | So I have been using the Wi-Fi network because this, of course, is a much smaller range,               |
| 32:41      | but it pops up and it asks you to confirm running it.                                                  |
| 32:46      | But it is, at the moment, I am still using it and it suggests stopping a timer, it doesn't             |
| 32:51      | force me to stop the timer, it shows me what timer is running and allows me to choose from             |
| 32:55      | a menu whether or not I want to keep it running or stop it.                                            |
| 32:59      | And it will also hand over the playback to my HomePod if any audio is playing, which                  |
| 33:04      | is pretty nice.                                                                                        |
| 33:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 33:06      | So I put one together based on the Starbucks Wi-Fi that includes the name Starbucks.                   |
| 33:12      | Once again, it has to be approved by me, but when I say yes, because I liked it, whenever              |
| 33:17      | I go to Starbucks, I actually like to make it like focused writing time.                               |
| 33:23      | And so it opens OmniFocus, it opens Ulysses, turns on Do Not Disturb and does all three                |
| 33:29      | of those things.                                                                                       |
| 33:30      | For me, kind of a reminder, hey, that's why you're here buddy, get to work, don't sit                  |
| 33:34      | and goof off on Twitter.                                                                               |
| 33:35      | And that works good for me.                                                                            |
| 33:38      | I don't like the approval step and I understand, as Rosa is saying, I think they call them             |
| 33:44      | passive events where you go in and just something just happens.                                        |
| 33:49      | They don't want your phone just doing things without you realising, especially if you download         |
| 33:52      | one from somebody else.                                                                                |
| 33:55      | But at the same time, I wish there was a user way to turn that off.                                    |
| 33:58      | I would like that to be even more automatic.                                                           |
| 34:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:02      | I mean, as it is, depending on your shortcut, so for example, the ones you run with when               |
| 34:08      | an app is opened, then you can have it ask before running and you can choose to toggle                 |
| 34:13      | that off.                                                                                              |
| 34:14      | But that's just not present for things like connecting to a Wi-Fi network or connecting                |
| 34:17      | to a Bluetooth device, which is in some ways a shame, but it's understandable from a security          |
| 34:23      | perspective if annoying for us users who would really like to just be like, yeah, this is              |
| 34:28      | my home network.                                                                                       |
| 34:29      | If somebody spoofs it, I'll live with the fact that it asks me to stop my time talking.                |
| 34:36      | Another thing as part of Apple's just overall security push as of late, now if you want                |
| 34:41      | to download shortcuts from third parties like the ones Rosa and I will be posting or the               |
| 34:46      | ones that are in my field guide, you've got to go into the shortcut settings and check                 |
| 34:51      | the box to allow, I think they call it untrusted shortcuts.                                            |
| 34:56      | You can trust us.                                                                                      |
| 34:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 34:58      | You can trust us.                                                                                      |
| 34:59      | But anyway, I don't like that name.                                                                    |
| 35:00      | I trust you, David.                                                                                    |
| 35:01      | Anyway, so you've got to click that or you won't be able even to download them, which                  |
| 35:06      | is kind of silly.                                                                                      |
| 35:08      | One more of these triggers that I, this is one I'm definitely the most excited about                   |
| 35:13      | is the NFC trigger.                                                                                    |
| 35:15      | I'm loving NFC so much, especially because I realised that my work ID is an NFC card.                  |
| 35:22      | Oh, really?                                                                                            |
| 35:23      | And so I can use my work ID to trigger stuff.                                                          |
| 35:25      | And you can actually use bank cards as well as a tip, don't try and use an Apple pay device            |
| 35:29      | because it generates a new number every time and that obviously will not work because it's             |
| 35:34      | looking for the same NFC tag every time rather than different ones.                                    |
| 35:38      | But you can use like bank cards, ID cards, stuff like that.                                            |
| 35:42      | If it's got a chip inside it, it's probably an NFC chip of some kind.                                  |
| 35:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 35:46      | And this is not passive because you're actively tagging it.                                            |
| 35:50      | Things just happen when you tag an NFC.                                                                |
| 35:53      | So what are you doing with it?                                                                         |
| 35:55      | I have one on my desk at work.                                                                         |
| 35:56      | I've actually got a couple of these scattered around.                                                  |
| 35:58      | I was going to attach an NFC tag to my keychain at work and then I realised that I can use             |
| 36:03      | my work ID.                                                                                            |
| 36:04      | So that's one less thing to put on my keychain.                                                        |
| 36:07      | And I use this for my work time tracking where I have to log which projects I've been working          |
| 36:12      | on for approximately how long and stuff like that.                                                     |
| 36:14      | So I've been using that and that's been working really well for me.                                    |
| 36:17      | What is the automation of that?                                                                        |
| 36:18      | Because presumably you have more than one time event to track.                                         |
| 36:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 36:23      | So I'm not going to go into huge amounts of details, but essentially there's a Windows-based           |
| 36:28      | application with XML config files which once a month or so I parse out and pull in the                 |
| 36:36      | data and then it just offers me a list of the projects and it logs it to a CSV file which              |
| 36:43      | I convert back to XML with Python.                                                                     |
| 36:47      | It's an overly complicated system which I use because I really don't want to have to                   |
| 36:51      | use Windows all the time.                                                                              |
| 36:53      | So yeah, I wouldn't recommend that for most people.                                                    |
| 36:56      | I would recommend using something like timing which now has an API or toggle with the Timer            |
| 37:01      | Reapplication to do this instead, but our work system needs to be on our work servers for              |
| 37:07      | obvious reasons.                                                                                       |
| 37:08      | So yeah, I'm stuck with what I've got.                                                                 |
| 37:11      | So the example I did in the Shortcuts field guide was a simple one.                                    |
| 37:15      | I put a NFC trigger in my paper notebook and the reason I wanted to do that is because                 |
| 37:23      | I also log a bunch of the stuff I put in there into day one.                                           |
| 37:27      | So all I have to do is tap on it and then magic happens in day one, which is cool.                     |
| 37:33      | But now I was so busy getting this field guide done, I didn't go as deep on this as I wanted.          |
| 37:38      | Now I've got some more.                                                                                |
| 37:40      | And so I am starting to go crazy with NFC tags and stickers.                                           |
| 37:45      | I've got one now on the bedside table.                                                                 |
| 37:48      | I've set it up where when I tap it, the bathroom lights turn on.                                       |
| 37:55      | It currently, it chooses the song Raise Theme from the Star Wars Force Awakens soundtrack              |
| 38:04      | because I think it's a great morning song, just kind of like an uplifting song.                        |
| 38:09      | And then it drives that to the HomePod.                                                                |
| 38:11      | And that's the pieces I'm doing so far.                                                                |
| 38:14      | As I sit here, I'm thinking I have a really cool shortcut called Morning Routine where                 |
| 38:19      | it gives me the morning report.                                                                        |
| 38:20      | I think I'm going to add that to the in where it runs that shortcut.                                   |
| 38:24      | But anyway, so that's like, I want to just wake up, tap my phone and have things happen                |
| 38:28      | and playing with it over the last couple of days.                                                      |
| 38:31      | I've realised now I need a second sticker on my nightstand for the nighttime stuff, right?             |
| 38:37      | So that's going to happen for sure.                                                                    |
| 38:40      | I've got some stickers.                                                                                |
| 38:41      | So I I've just been kind of thinking through where I want to put them.                                 |
| 38:45      | I'm definitely putting one in the car.                                                                 |
| 38:48      | And I'm not exactly sure what it's going to do yet, but I'm going to have one in the                   |
| 38:52      | car.                                                                                                   |
| 38:53      | Don't forget you can use CarPlay as a trigger too, though, and that's another active trigger.          |
| 38:59      | So when you plug your phone into your car, it can just do stuff.                                       |
| 39:02      | That is true, Rose.                                                                                    |
| 39:03      | That's true.                                                                                           |
| 39:04      | Even as a passenger, there may be something different I want to do.                                    |
| 39:07      | So the I'm definitely putting one inside the refrigerator and I'm going to use that to                 |
| 39:13      | trigger the shared grocery list and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list that we have.                                       |
| 39:17      | So when I look and then we run out of carrots, I can just tap it and get to work.                      |
| 39:22      | So I don't know.                                                                                       |
| 39:23      | I'm going to have fun with this.                                                                       |
| 39:24      | I ordered off Amazon some key chain NFC triggers.                                                      |
| 39:27      | They haven't arrived yet, but they're on the way.                                                      |
| 39:29      | This was kind of my promise to myself once I finished the field guide that I could kind                |
| 39:34      | of go nuts with NFC.                                                                                   |
| 39:37      | I was looking this morning as I left the house at the door jam, I'm like, it doesn't rub               |
| 39:43      | too much in this section of the door jam.                                                              |
| 39:45      | I wonder if I could put a trigger inside the door jam.                                                 |
| 39:48      | So you would never see it except when you open the door, but you could always tap it                   |
| 39:52      | on your way in or your way out.                                                                        |
| 39:54      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 39:55      | So I've got plans, Rose.                                                                               |
| 39:56      | I've got many plans.                                                                                   |
| 39:58      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 39:59      | So it's time to talk about our next sponsor and our second sponsor for today's episode                 |
| 40:04      | is Zapier.                                                                                             |

| 40:08      | Growing a business is hard, especially when you're spending hours every day moving data                |
| 40:12      | from emails to spreadsheets to wherever else.                                                          |
| 40:15      | Wouldn't it be easier if all of these things work together without you lifting a finger?               |

| 40:26      | You can focus on the things that matter most.                                                          |
| 40:29      | You don't need to waste any more time on tasks you know could be automated because that's              |
| 40:34      | what Zapier was built to do.                                                                           |
| 40:36      | So if you work in sales, Zapier lets you instantly engage with leads and send them to a CRM or         |
| 40:40      | a spreadsheet and then notify your team so that they can act quickly on every opportunity.             |
| 40:45      | But whatever your business, you can build the exact solution you need in minutes without               |
| 40:50      | writing code or asking a developer for help.                                                           |
| 40:52      | And with support for more than 1,500 business applications, it's no wonder that more than              |
| 40:56      | 4.5 million people are saving 40 hours a month using Zapier.                                           |
| 41:01      | So one of the ways that I use Zapier is when certain transactions happen, then my bank will            |
| 41:05      | send me an email.                                                                                      |
| 41:06      | But these are things that I need logged because they are business transactions.                        |
| 41:09      | So I actually have Zapier grab this information out of the email.                                      |
| 41:12      | It parses the date and the amount and it puts them into my accounting software for me with             |
| 41:17      | the email as a PDF just to go along with it for, you know, perfection.                                 |
| 41:22      | I love the fact that it has so many features of all of the applications from invoicing                 |
| 41:27      | software that I host on my own server, Invoice Ninja, to being able to integrate with things like       |
| 41:33      | Quip, which I use with David.                                                                          |
| 41:35      | It's really easy to use Zapier and they're working on a new user interface as well, which              |
| 41:40      | is really nice.                                                                                        |

| 42:07      | All right, Rose, there's a couple of things I want to talk to you about.                               |
| 42:11      | Let's start with things we lost along the way.                                                         |
| 42:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 42:16      | There's one that really makes me sad because it was such a good one.                                   |
| 42:19      | Set wallpaper and it's gone and I'm sad because it sounds really silly, why am I so sad about          |
| 42:26      | set wallpaper?                                                                                         |
| 42:27      | But I was actually using this when I clock in at work and clock out to set my wallpaper                |
| 42:30      | to a work wallpaper and a non-work wallpaper and with other time tracking to remind me what            |
| 42:35      | I'm actually working on.                                                                               |
| 42:38      | I can't do this anymore and I'm sad because now my phone has the same wallpaper all the                |
| 42:42      | time and it won't show me what I'm doing on the home screen.                                           |
| 42:47      | It sounds really silly, but it was actually making me really productive.                               |
| 42:51      | I filed radars on this and hopefully it's going to come back at some point.                            |
| 42:55      | Yeah, this is one I'd really like to know the story behind it.                                         |
| 42:59      | Why did that have to come up?                                                                          |
| 43:01      | It seems like it's pretty simple.                                                                      |
| 43:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 43:04      | You can, for example, you can turn your Wi-Fi on and off, but you can't set your wallpaper.            |
| 43:11      | It sounds crazy to me that you can't do this, but hey, I'm sure there's a reason for it.               |
| 43:16      | I also suspect it may come back at some point, but I'll miss that one.                                 |
| 43:21      | One of the things about this new shortcuts paradigm is that they've built a way.                       |
| 43:26      | If you've used shortcuts in the past, you know that there's actions.                                   |
| 43:29      | If you like OmniFocus, you'll go and you'll see there's two or three actions in there                  |
| 43:34      | that the shortcuts team built that specifically does something in OmniFocus.                           |
| 43:40      | But that's always been, you've always been at the subject to the shortcuts team creating               |
| 43:46      | these actions, these app-specific actions, and with this new version, developers will                  |
| 43:52      | be able to build their own actions.                                                                    |
| 43:55      | That's good because it means that we're no longer going to have that massive bottleneck                |
| 43:59      | that we previously had of if a developer wanted to add an action to shortcuts and they had             |
| 44:03      | to contact the team over at Apple and say, hey, we have this action.                                   |
| 44:08      | Can you edit shortcuts?                                                                                |
| 44:09      | Did it approve?                                                                                        |
| 44:10      | Did it add it?                                                                                         |
| 44:11      | Turns out there's a bug in it, so it has to get fixed, and it's going back and forth                   |
| 44:14      | between two people.                                                                                    |
| 44:15      | At the same time, it does mean that developers have to do this now, and maybe not every developer      |
| 44:19      | is going to see the advantage of shortcuts.                                                            |
| 44:22      | As crazy as it is to think about that.                                                                 |
| 44:24      | I know some developers are just saying, oh, we're just going to replace the shortcuts                  |
| 44:27      | that were there.                                                                                       |
| 44:28      | We're not going to add anything new.                                                                   |
| 44:29      | It's like, ooh, okay.                                                                                  |
| 44:30      | Do you know who you're talking to?                                                                     |
| 44:31      | I love shortcuts.                                                                                      |
| 44:32      | Please don't do this.                                                                                  |
| 44:33      | Please add more.                                                                                       |
| 44:34      | More is good.                                                                                          |
| 44:35      | But there are developers that will get it, and for them, I expect that we're going to                  |
| 44:40      | see a lot more support in shortcuts than we've seen before, and we're going to get a lot               |
| 44:45      | more power.                                                                                            |
| 44:48      | I guess this goes in hand with the discussion of [[URL Schemes]].                                          |
| 44:53      | I mean, [[URL Schemes]] are the foundation of workflow, which became shortcuts, but with                   |
| 44:58      | this new programming interface, with this new ability of developers to build their                     |
| 45:03      | own actions, where do you see the future of URL shortcuts in all of this?                              |
| 45:10      | Well, I think it's going away, and I don't know if it absolutely should go away, because               |
| 45:16      | for example, having the ability to put a link to a Dev and Think object inside of an Omni              |
| 45:21      | focused task so that I can just jump to either a PDF or a group of items is, for me, something         |
| 45:29      | extremely useful, especially for anything relating to my Master's degree, because without              |
| 45:35      | Dev and Think, I'm pretty certain that my Master's degree would be probably on fire                    |
| 45:38      | somewhere, crying in a corner, rather than doing relatively well as it currently is,                   |
| 45:44      | because I don't do well if I'm not organised, and for things like that, I definitely need              |
| 45:49      | interrupt links to remain available, but at the same time, it would be great if the shortcuts          |
| 45:56      | framework can sink down another layer into the operating system.                                       |
| 46:00      | So right now, we have, when I open an app, do this.                                                    |
| 46:05      | Well, how about next year, when I open, for example, [[Drafts]], and I open this workspace                 |
| 46:10      | in [[Drafts]], then I want that to happen, but if I open this other workspace in [[Drafts]],                   |
| 46:14      | then I want this thing to happen, and that's what I think we will hopefully see at some                |
| 46:20      | point.                                                                                                 |
| 46:21      | Well, I've heard it was said in some of the sessions, so don't ask me which ones, because              |
| 46:26      | I'm struggling to find the links right now, that [[URL Schemes]] are insecure, which, depending            |
| 46:31      | on whether or not there's keys involved and things like that, which some applications                  |
| 46:35      | have used, is definitely a possibility, and it would be great if there was a proper mechanism          |
| 46:43      | that was created specifically for this purpose, for apps to pass data between themselves.              |
| 46:48      | And we know that a lot of this already exists, for example, drag and drop probably has a               |
| 46:53      | bunch of this stuff involved, it would be great if I could say, hey, drop this image                   |
| 47:00      | over here, but also flip it 90 degrees to the right and make it black and white or something           |
| 47:07      | like that.                                                                                             |
| 47:10      | If we could have shortcuts as a next level down framework, but I think we may be a few                 |
| 47:15      | years away from that.                                                                                  |
| 47:17      | I do think that URL shortcuts are not going away in the next year, I think we're going                 |
| 47:21      | to be fine.                                                                                            |
| 47:22      | In fact, I included a URL shortcut explanation and video and in the new field guide.                   |
| 47:27      | But I also think that Apple's counting on developers to really kind of step up and create              |
| 47:34      | the automations.                                                                                       |
| 47:35      | I think for a lot of people, the URL shortcuts are kind of a block, they have trouble or like,         |
| 47:40      | you have to go to a website and you have to figure out how to structure it.                            |
| 47:43      | And it's like, it is additional work to create those in a perfect world.                               |
| 47:48      | All of the functionality that we have from URL shortcuts would be duplicated with developer            |
| 47:54      | created actions, which are easier to use and in fact, just better and more secure.                     |
| 47:59      | I think more realistically, what's going to happen is some of those functions are going                |
| 48:03      | to get created in developer actions, but I suspect not all of them will be and that                    |
| 48:09      | if URL shortcuts go away or [[URL Schemes]] go away, we will lose some functionality that                  |
| 48:15      | we get with them that we won't be able to create with the application actions.                         |
| 48:19      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 48:20      | And I would encourage everybody listening who has used a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] and who is actively                |
| 48:26      | using [[URL Schemes]], if the developers don't over the next few months already go in and                  |
| 48:33      | add shortcut actions with parameters to replace these content, the developers and say, hey,            |
| 48:39      | I'm using this, but it would be really great if you could create it as a shortcut with                 |
| 48:42      | parameters please.                                                                                     |
| 48:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 48:44      | And, you know, don't put huge amounts of pressure on developers and insist that they                   |
| 48:49      | do it.                                                                                                 |
| 48:50      | You know, that's not how we're going to win this battle.                                               |
| 48:52      | But, you know, asking nicely if this can be added because I'm seeing some seriously                    |
| 48:57      | amazing things, some of which I'm not yet allowed to talk about.                                       |
| 49:00      | But for example, look at what [[Simon Støvring]] has been doing.                                          |
| 49:03      | He's tweeted a bunch of stuff of things that he's experimented with.                                   |
| 49:07      | Not all of this will go into the release of JSON or Scriptable or a yet to be named application        |
| 49:13      | for storing data, but it's amazing to see what developers can do with this with a little               |
| 49:19      | bit of creativity.                                                                                     |
| 49:21      | And some developers may not realise that you're using their [[URL Schemes]] that much and that             |
| 49:25      | you're depending on it.                                                                                |
| 49:26      | And if we don't let developers know how much we love their software and the work that they're          |
| 49:29      | doing, then why would they implement their replacement?                                                |
| 49:33      | It's work.                                                                                             |
| 49:34      | It's probably, in some cases, not an insignificant amount of work to do this.                          |
| 49:38      | So we should let people know if they don't already know by themselves and just do it.                  |
| 49:43      | Yeah, but [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]] gets it.                                                                               |
| 49:45      | You know, he's the poster child for this.                                                              |
| 49:47      | And you know, I would say Greg Pierce over [[Drafts]] and there's a couple people out there                |
| 49:51      | that are already on top of this.                                                                       |
| 49:54      | So I guess what I would say is if you've got an app that you're using any URL shortcut                 |
| 49:58      | on, drop the developer and say, hey, you know, I would really appreciate it if you made this           |
| 50:03      | into an action in shortcuts.                                                                           |
| 50:06      | And I think they need that data.                                                                       |
| 50:07      | They need to know people are using it and that people want this.                                       |
| 50:10      | And that will inspire them to hopefully go put the time in to make those.                              |
| 50:14      | And like I said, I'm sure we're good for a year.                                                       |
| 50:18      | I mean, I'm not sure.                                                                                  |
| 50:19      | I don't know what's going on inside Apple, but I would suspect we're good for at least                 |
| 50:22      | a year on this.                                                                                        |
| 50:24      | But I don't think we should be just sitting back assuming that [[URL Schemes]] are going to                |
| 50:27      | be there forever.                                                                                      |
| 50:28      | So if you're using them, you know, start talking to your developers now and hopefully                  |
| 50:36      | getting them on the track of getting you away from the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] in case Apple ever pulls             |
| 50:41      | the rug on that.                                                                                       |
| 50:42      | And even if Apple doesn't pull the rug on it, you know, how many more people may end                   |
| 50:46      | up using this application because it turns out that there is a great automated way that                |
| 50:50      | they can, I don't know, add a list that they can add packing items to that they want to                |
| 50:56      | pack for their next trip, not that I've been battling with this problem at all recently.               |
| 51:01      | But, you know, there's always something out there that will be the catch for somebody                  |
| 51:08      | and it may well be automation for a lot of people, especially for people who are maybe                 |
| 51:12      | now going, hey, that new iPad looks pretty affordable.                                                 |
| 51:15      | It's got a decent size screen.                                                                         |
| 51:18      | I'll give it a go, you know, let's make their experience a great one.                                  |
| 51:22      | And I know that a lot of developers, [[Greg Pierce\|Agile Tortoise]], [[Simon Støvring]], as previously mentioned,         |
| 51:27      | Anders Borum, all of these people are doing a great job to try and add, you know, value                 |
| 51:34      | to the shortcuts that they're donating with these parameters and all of these options.                 |
| 51:40      | It's going to be great to play with us.                                                                |
| 51:41      | And not only that, I feel like any [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] that you turn into a shortcut action is immediately      |
| 51:47      | going to be used by a lot more people because.                                                         |
| 51:49      | It's advertisement for your app because when they open shortcuts, you know, and then you               |
| 51:54      | tap on the option to add a shortcut and it comes up as an option, you know, it's listed                |
| 52:01      | right there in the applications for you.                                                               |
| 52:03      | It is free app, free advertisement, let's go with advertisement.                                       |
| 52:08      | Well, and I think it's just going to be so much easier for people to implement that                    |
| 52:12      | more people are going to implement it, it's just, it just has to be true.                              |
| 52:17      | It's almost the difference between [[AppleScript]] and [[Automator]] on the Mac, you know, it's            |
| 52:23      | just like it's so much easier when it's it's compact and built in, maybe a little less                 |
| 52:28      | powerful, but so much easier.                                                                          |
| 52:30      | Okay, so that is an issue and be aware of it and we really would like you to let your                  |
| 52:37      | favourite developers know if there's something you're using that you would like to see turned           |
| 52:40      | into an action.                                                                                        |
| 52:41      | I think the upside of this is we're going to talk about this on the show, I'm sure three               |
| 52:46      | to six months after all this releases, we're going to have this rich assortment of tools               |
| 52:51      | that don't exist right now.                                                                            |
| 52:53      | So Rose, something I want to talk to you about.                                                        |
| 52:58      | We did a whole show on the shortcuts home screen and I liked it, but ultimately didn't                 |
| 53:04      | stick with it.                                                                                         |
| 53:05      | And what I did instead was I put a bunch of shortcuts, you know, on my, was it the today               |
| 53:13      | screen?                                                                                                |
| 53:14      | The widget.                                                                                            |
| 53:15      | I changed the name.                                                                                    |
| 53:16      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 53:17      | Yeah, it's the widget in the today screen.                                                             |
| 53:18      | Yeah, now it's widget screen.                                                                          |
| 53:19      | And then like a week after you'd installed iOS 13, I just get a message from David with                |
| 53:23      | a home screen full of shortcuts.                                                                       |
| 53:25      | Oh yeah, I love it now.                                                                                |
| 53:27      | So what they did with the problem with the original one was it would bounce to [[Safari]]                  |
| 53:31      | before it ran the shortcut and it was just nuts, you know, it just, it felt really goofy               |
| 53:39      | to me, you know.                                                                                       |
| 53:41      | And so, but now they fix that.                                                                         |
| 53:43      | So now starting with iOS 13, if you put a shortcut on your home screen, first of all,                  |
| 53:47      | there's a couple of things they did.                                                                   |
| 53:48      | Number one is you can put a shortcut on your home screen with no name.                                 |
| 53:53      | Just delete the name.                                                                                  |
| 53:54      | You don't have to do the goofy thing where we had the shortcut with the invisible characters.          |
| 53:59      | You know, you just, just delete the name and then you save it to the home screen and                   |
| 54:02      | it saves the home screen without a name.                                                               |
| 54:04      | So you get rid of the name.                                                                            |
| 54:05      | That's cool.                                                                                           |
| 54:06      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 54:07      | Second thing is when you tap on it, it just opens up the shortcut, whatever you do.                    |
| 54:11      | Like for most of these home screen shortcuts, for me, they are nested shortcuts.                       |
| 54:17      | It's usually a choose from menu shortcut that has a bunch of other shortcuts and launch                |
| 54:21      | apps and different things underneath it.                                                               |
| 54:23      | So for me, I always almost always get a menu when I tap on one of them, but now you just               |
| 54:28      | tap on on your home screen.                                                                            |
| 54:30      | The menu just shows up.                                                                                |
| 54:32      | I did this like the second week of the beta install and I have had shortcuts on my home                |
| 54:39      | screen exclusively every since.                                                                        |
| 54:43      | And I have no desire to go back to the crazy old way of having just a single app on my                 |
| 54:49      | home screen.                                                                                           |
| 54:50      | It is so much more powerful with shortcuts.                                                            |
| 54:52      | Like I tapped the MacSparky home screen, sorry, the MacSparky icon, it's a little                    |
| 54:59      | lightning bolt on my home screen.                                                                      |
| 55:00      | Let me show you, tell you what's on it right now.                                                      |
| 55:02      | I have to open my phone up.                                                                            |
| 55:05      | Come on face ID, wake up, wake up.                                                                     |
| 55:07      | Anyway.                                                                                                |
| 55:08      | Well, currently you need a new iPhone.                                                                 |
| 55:10      | That's why it's acting out right.                                                                      |
| 55:11      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 55:12      | That's what's going on.                                                                                |
| 55:13      | So right now, I can, when I tap that, I have a menu.                                                   |
| 55:16      | Number one is my inbox in my mail.                                                                     |
| 55:19      | Second one is my later folder for MacSparky.                                                          |
| 55:21      | The third one is my action items and OmniFocus.                                                        |
| 55:26      | Fourth one is my planning.                                                                             |
| 55:28      | The fifth one is a post idea if I want to write a post for MacSparky.                                 |
| 55:32      | Then I've got a whole series of them for show prep for all my various podcasts where it                |
| 55:36      | takes me to the Google doc or the Quip doc or wherever I'm doing the work.                              |
| 55:42      | Another one opens up my blogging application.                                                          |
| 55:45      | Another one goes to Airtable.                                                                          |
| 55:46      | Another one goes to the, I have a bunch of emails and things that I automate when I send               |
| 55:54      | like a sponsor.                                                                                        |
| 55:56      | I have to send them an email with preparation.                                                         |
| 55:58      | So I've got a whole bunch of automated emails in there.                                                |
| 56:01      | Then I've got some shortcuts that are nested here, but like I've got another one just called           |
| 56:04      | tech podcast.                                                                                          |
| 56:05      | So if I want to listen to shows related to the technology side of my life, it's in this                |
| 56:11      | shortcut.                                                                                              |
| 56:12      | I tap the button, it opens up, podcast starts playing them.                                            |
| 56:15      | And then I've also got one here to go to my RSS stuff, which is almost exclusively news                |
| 56:20      | about technology.                                                                                      |
| 56:22      | So it's like all that stuff is covered with one shortcut on my home screen.                            |
| 56:26      | So I look at my phone, I tap that, then I tap the one I want to do.                                    |
| 56:29      | It takes me not only to the mail app, it takes me to the mailbox in the mail app that deals            |
| 56:34      | with this problem.                                                                                     |
| 56:37      | And it allows me to avoid a whole bunch of distractions along the way.                                 |
| 56:41      | And I've got a whole screen for those.                                                                 |
| 56:42      | I've got one for the legal practice, I've got one for health, I've got one for personal,               |
| 56:47      | I've got them for getting directions, cameras, travel, listening to audio.                             |
| 56:54      | Some of this stuff is in multiple places.                                                              |
| 56:56      | Like the audio one also has the tech podcast shortcut, but it's in two different places                |
| 57:02      | so I can get to it two different ways.                                                                 |
| 57:05      | I don't know, I'm really happy with this system.                                                       |
| 57:07      | Yeah, it's a great system.                                                                             |
| 57:09      | You're convincing me to try it out again because I had the same problem as you before                  |
| 57:13      | with the whole bouncing to [[Safari]] and then bouncing into shortcuts.                                    |
| 57:16      | And then doing the action, it was, in some cases, actually literally giving me headaches               |
| 57:21      | just because of the not quite speedy enough transitions.                                               |
| 57:26      | And the fact that that's gone is such a massive thing.                                                 |
| 57:30      | I'm now going to have another look at this and give it another go because I've got a                   |
| 57:34      | bunch of things on my home screen which are basically folders to let me do stuff related               |
| 57:39      | to the suite setup or to my blog or to automators or nested folders.                                   |
| 57:45      | And so it's, yeah, it's a good idea to segregate those out.                                            |
| 57:48      | I'm going to have to see if maybe I can get deep URL so I can go straight to the correct               |
| 57:53      | select chats even for each of these.                                                                   |
| 57:55      | Yeah, I haven't played with that if you figured that out, let me know.                                 |
| 58:00      | But so the downsides to this, one of the things that iOS 13 is this idea of this long press            |
| 58:05      | on apps, you know, the force touch is gone, but it basically gives you the same thing                  |
| 58:12      | and it carries the feature over to the iPad.                                                           |
| 58:13      | I am not at all upset about them taking that away.                                                     |
| 58:18      | And some apps have genuinely good features when you do that long press on them.                        |
| 58:23      | If the app's not on your home screen, obviously you can't use that feature.                            |
| 58:27      | But I feel like having these shortcuts based on context as opposed to applications totally             |
| 58:34      | makes up for that.                                                                                     |
| 58:36      | The other thing you do, I do with this is the, I have in the bottom dock, I have four                  |
| 58:42      | apps, you know, actually I have three apps I have.                                                     |
| 58:45      | Right now, calendar, I was, I'm jumping between fantastic calendar and calendar.                       |
| 58:49      | Always during the beta I try to use the Apple native stuff.                                            |
| 58:52      | But I've got calendar right now and I've got OmniFocus and I'm trying to do more with                  |
| 58:57      | Apple Notes because that's also something that got a lot of improvement with this new                  |
| 59:00      | one.                                                                                                   |
| 59:01      | So I've got Apple Notes down there.                                                                    |
| 59:02      | And then I actually got, I have one more shortcut in the bottom, which is kind of what                 |
| 59:06      | I call kind of my input shortcut, where it's like it creates a new draft, creates a new                |
| 59:11      | OmniFocus inbox items, creates new Apple Notes.                                                        |
| 59:14      | So it does a whole bunch of stuff.                                                                     |
| 59:15      | I've got that in the dock for now.                                                                     |
| 59:16      | But the, and then at the top row, I put the four folders, you know, I've talked about                  |
| 59:21      | this on Mac power users, I've got make is one folder.                                                  |
| 59:27      | And none of them have names on them anymore because I don't like the names.                            |
| 59:30      | So I've got, I've got make, learn, fix and play.                                                       |
| 59:34      | So all apps go into one of those four folders.                                                         |
| 59:37      | So I can get to the apps if I want to from the home screen as well.                                    |
| 59:41      | But I'm getting, I'm really happy with this.                                                           |
| 59:43      | If you got turned off of Siri shortcut home screens because of all the bouncing around,                |
| 59:49      | it was doing what was launching from the, the, the screen, then you should definitely check            |
| 59:56      | it out again.                                                                                          |
| 59:57      | I will, I'm going to pull the short, this is one of the videos I did in the field guide                |
| 01:00:02   | is all about this.                                                                                     |
| 01:00:03   | I'm going to just put that one in the show notes.                                                      |
| 01:00:05   | I'll post it to YouTube and put in the show notes so you guys can see it.                              |
| 01:00:09   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:00:10   | The, the one last piece of this though is on iPad.                                                     |
| 01:00:14   | Now we have the ability to permanently place the widgets on the home screen.                           |
| 01:00:19   | So on iPad, I have not turned it into the shortcuts home screen.                                       |
| 01:00:23   | I have just got that widget.                                                                           |
| 01:00:25   | That's number, it's widget number two.                                                                 |
| 01:00:28   | So it's always apparent.                                                                               |
| 01:00:30   | And I've been selective about which one.                                                               |
| 01:00:31   | So I've already got them on the home screen on the left side and actually put apps on                  |
| 01:00:36   | the home screen of the, of the iPad apps on your home screen.                                          |
| 01:00:40   | Crazy idea.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:42   | I have to say the, the, the widgets for me frequently replace what force touch or long                 |
| 01:00:48   | press as it is now has previously offered.                                                             |
| 01:00:50   | So for example, Kale zones will show you a list of the time zones with whatever names                  |
| 01:00:54   | you've given it, which is one of my favourite applications because with you being in a different        |
| 01:00:59   | time zone, Scotty, my other podcast co-host also being a different time zone.                           |
| 01:01:04   | And you know, my family, my parents currently in Thailand, for example, and it's great to              |
| 01:01:08   | literally just be able to swipe over and go, okay, so it's, it's quarter past nine where               |
| 01:01:12   | David is right now.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:14   | You know, that that's really useful, but I don't need it under force touch.                            |
| 01:01:19   | It's easier to just swipe because even if I happen to be on my fifth home screen, I                    |
| 01:01:24   | tried taking all of my apps out of folders.                                                            |
| 01:01:26   | This is not going to stick, but I tried it, um, then I can just swipe down from the top                |
| 01:01:30   | and across.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:31   | So.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:32   | Makes sense.                                                                                           |
| 01:01:33   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:01:34   | Let's talk about our last sponsor and that's our friends over at PDF pin from smile.                   |
| 01:01:39   | This episode of the automators is brought to you by PDF pin.                                           |
| 01:01:43   | From smile.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:44   | It's the ultimate tool for editing PDFs on the back, PDF pin version 11 is out and it                  |
| 01:01:51   | can turn your scan documents into edible texts with PDF pins built in OCR support.                     |
| 01:01:57   | So often I get sent PDFs that don't have optical character recognition.                                |
| 01:02:02   | It's crazy.                                                                                            |
| 01:02:03   | So I just open up PDF pin and it says, Hey, Sparky, it looks like this doesn't have OCR.               |
| 01:02:08   | Do you want it?                                                                                        |
| 01:02:09   | I say yes.                                                                                             |
| 01:02:10   | And it goes through and it does a few things.                                                          |
| 01:02:12   | People don't realise that, you know, there's more to this OCR stuff than you think.                    |
| 01:02:15   | Like the first thing PDF pin does is it straightens the pages.                                         |
| 01:02:18   | You know, if the pages are a little crooked and you do OCR on them, then when you go to                |
| 01:02:21   | select the text later, it's madness.                                                                   |
| 01:02:24   | You can't have that.                                                                                   |
| 01:02:25   | They straighten the page.                                                                              |
| 01:02:26   | They do the OCR and then at the end, they give you this nice zen gong that just makes                  |
| 01:02:30   | me so happy when I hear that go off because I know, I know how's OCR.                                  |
| 01:02:35   | And with PDF pin and OCR, you can compare two parts of the same document with a split                  |
| 01:02:39   | view and you can mark up the documents with the scribble tool and add annotations and notes.           |
| 01:02:44   | This is what I do all the time in the legal half of my life.                                           |
| 01:02:48   | PDF pin Pro 11 can automatically turn your documents into fillable forms, plus export                  |
| 01:02:54   | them to Excel, PowerPoint and more.                                                                    |
| 01:02:56   | And sharing documents with PDF pin on iPhone and iPad or your Mac is as simple with the                |
| 01:03:02   | iCloud or [[Dropbox]] storage.                                                                             |
| 01:03:03   | Now, if you do any work using PDFs, you need PDF pin, it's really powerful.                            |

| 01:03:15   | One last feature I can never resist talking about with PDF pin is where you take a PDF                 |
| 01:03:22   | and turn it into a Word document.                                                                      |
| 01:03:24   | This is a dirty trick that lawyers do.                                                                 |
| 01:03:26   | If you're a lawyer and you do this shame on you, where you're negotiating a contract,                  |
| 01:03:30   | you send the other guy the contract and you make it a PDF.                                             |
| 01:03:33   | So then you can't track changes and make edits.                                                        |
| 01:03:36   | So it's kind of a passive aggressive way to try and get you just take the terms, right?                |
| 01:03:41   | That's not a problem with PDF pin pro or you just take the document, you say, save this                |
| 01:03:46   | as a Word document, it converts it to a Word document, then you send it back to them with              |
| 01:03:50   | red line changes.                                                                                      |
| 01:03:51   | They're scratching their head.                                                                         |
| 01:03:52   | They don't know what you just did.                                                                     |
| 01:03:54   | It was PDF pin that saved the day once again.                                                          |
| 01:03:56   | So once again, that's smilesoftware.com/podcast.                                                 |
| 01:04:00   | Go check it out.                                                                                       |
| 01:04:01   | Thanks to PDF pin for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                                  |
| 01:04:06   | So when we were at [[WWDC]], I was thinking, well, I can just do an update to the shortcuts                |
| 01:04:17   | field guide.                                                                                           |
| 01:04:18   | And then I started looking at it and I realised everything has changed.                                |
| 01:04:22   | Nothing is the same.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:23   | I have to do this over and I have to do it better.                                                     |
| 01:04:26   | So I've spent, according to my time tracking over 130 hours on this field guide, it just               |
| 01:04:33   | grew into something I never expected it to get as big as it did.                                       |
| 01:04:37   | It's 106 videos.                                                                                       |
| 01:04:39   | It may be 107 or eight by the time it releases.                                                        |
| 01:04:41   | We're recording this a few days before I finish it.                                                    |
| 01:04:44   | But I have on my air table 5.5 hours, but I still have post production to do on like                   |
| 01:04:50   | 15 videos.                                                                                             |
| 01:04:51   | So my guess is it'll be closer to six hours by the time it's done.                                     |
| 01:04:55   | And I hope I'm not scaring away people that would be interested in it with so much data.               |
| 01:04:59   | But I really did a good job, I think of breaking it up into pieces.                                    |
| 01:05:04   | One of the feedbacks I got last year was some people saying, look, I want it to be more                |
| 01:05:08   | basic because I have trouble with just getting started with this.                                      |
| 01:05:13   | And then the other feedback I got was I wanted to be more advanced.                                    |
| 01:05:16   | So I added two new sections to this one.                                                               |
| 01:05:18   | And the first one is called Shortcuts Key Concepts, which is kind of for beginners just to kind        |
| 01:05:23   | of give you like explaining what a variable is and a magic variable and how share sheet                 |
| 01:05:28   | triggers work.                                                                                         |
| 01:05:29   | And some of this stuff that, you know, just to really get you started, and then I added                |
| 01:05:33   | another additional section called Advanced Concepts where I go into Bay 64, [[URL Schemes]],               |
| 01:05:41   | you know, more high-end programming stuff.                                                             |
| 01:05:46   | And I think it's a help that I answered both of those with this.                                       |
| 01:05:49   | There was a lot of work went into this, but I'm really happy with the way it came out.                 |
| 01:05:52   | And I think you wouldn't have really been doing justice to yourself or anybody looking                 |
| 01:05:56   | to get this if you hadn't redone it just because there's so much that's so different.                  |
| 01:06:00   | Just the fact that get variable doesn't exist and it's built into every single action.                 |
| 01:06:06   | It's a big difference.                                                                                 |
| 01:06:07   | And if you're not experimented with iOS 13 yet and you thought that you were pretty good               |
| 01:06:11   | with Shortcuts than iOS 12, you were definitely going to adapt fine.                                   |
| 01:06:15   | And if anybody's tried Shortcuts before and got, eh, I didn't really get it, give it another           |
| 01:06:18   | shot and, you know, David's already shared some of the videos from the field guide in                  |
| 01:06:24   | the show notes previously to give you a taster.                                                        |
| 01:06:28   | So double-check those as well because it doesn't matter what your level is.                            |
| 01:06:33   | I have been sneaking through David's videos as he's been putting them up.                              |
| 01:06:36   | I've not had a chance to watch all of them yet, but it's really good.                                  |
| 01:06:40   | And I've been stealing lots of ideas from you, I have to say.                                          |
| 01:06:43   | Good.                                                                                                  |
| 01:06:44   | Well, there's no such thing as stealing with Shortcuts.                                                |
| 01:06:47   | We're all trying to help each other out.                                                               |
| 01:06:49   | So that's it.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:50   | I'm really proud of it.                                                                                |
| 01:06:51   | It is kind of a, it's quite a development for me to have one this big and this long,                   |
| 01:06:57   | but I think it makes sense for this and it's broken up logically.                                      |
| 01:07:00   | Most of the videos are in about the three-minute range.                                                |
| 01:07:04   | So there's nothing in here that's overwhelmed.                                                         |
| 01:07:05   | Some of them are a bit longer because they need to be and some of them are a bit shorter.              |
| 01:07:09   | But the sections are, you know, there's an introduction and overview.                                  |
| 01:07:12   | There's that key concepts thing I was talking about.                                                   |
| 01:07:15   | Kind of like when I did the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide, and this is different from the               |
| 01:07:19   | original version of the Shortcuts field guide, I did a whole section on triggers and a whole           |
| 01:07:23   | section on actions where I break down, you're like, I want to, if you want to learn how                |
| 01:07:26   | to use the Bluetooth trigger, there's a video explaining how.                                          |
| 01:07:30   | If you want to learn how to use actions that involve calendaring, there's a video just                 |
| 01:07:35   | about that.                                                                                            |
| 01:07:36   | And then the idea is you go through these and you start putting all these tools in your                |
| 01:07:39   | tool belt and you get ideas for what to do with them.                                                  |
| 01:07:42   | Then after that, getting through, and those application actions, I think it's something                |
| 01:07:46   | like 29 or 30 videos with different application actions that it takes on directly.                     |
| 01:07:51   | I'll be adding more to that, obviously, as some developers embrace shortcuts and add                   |
| 01:07:56   | their own actions.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:57   | And then the advanced concept section, like I said, base 64 [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]], some of the more               |
| 01:08:04   | complicated stuff, like there's a whole thing on dictionaries and how dictionaries work                |
| 01:08:07   | because a lot of people have questions about that.                                                     |
| 01:08:10   | And then after that, there's just like a boatload of useful shortcuts.                                 |
| 01:08:15   | And those are...                                                                                       |
| 01:08:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:17   | I'm seeing ETA to Disneyland here.                                                                     |
| 01:08:18   | I have a feeling if I do my ETA to Disneyland, it's going to take me a while to get there,             |
| 01:08:22   | but tell you what, I'll meet you in Batuu.                                                             |
| 01:08:24   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:25   | Well, I would love that first if you did that, Rose.                                                   |
| 01:08:27   | I will be your personal guide.                                                                         |
| 01:08:29   | But the reason I did Disneyland is, and I explained in the video, you can change the location          |
| 01:08:35   | when you download that shortcut to work or home or whatever you want, but I just wanted                |
| 01:08:38   | to use something fun for the video.                                                                    |
| 01:08:41   | But there's a whole bunch of them in there.                                                            |
| 01:08:44   | I don't have the table in front of me, but there's a lot of them.                                      |
| 01:08:48   | At some point...                                                                                       |
| 01:08:49   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:08:50   | There's a bunch of really useful ones here, and especially for people who are struggling               |
| 01:08:54   | to think of what you can do with shortcuts, I would recommend at the very least have a                 |
| 01:08:59   | look at this list because, you know, air dropping your screenshots or automating your meetings.        |
| 01:09:05   | I see hundreds of ideas here coming from the, I have no idea, 25-ish ideas that are listed.            |
| 01:09:12   | I've just got hundreds coming from it because, hey, I just took a photo, it would be great             |
| 01:09:16   | if I just could just airdrop this to people who are around me right now so I can share                 |
| 01:09:21   | immediately.                                                                                           |
| 01:09:22   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:23   | Stuff like that.                                                                                       |
| 01:09:24   | Yeah, there's 32 of them of the useful shortcuts as we record.                                         |
| 01:09:27   | And the idea was some of them are like two and three step shortcuts and some of them are               |
| 01:09:31   | like 70 step shortcuts.                                                                                |
| 01:09:33   | So you know, there's a mix in there and you can kind of go through and play with it.                   |
| 01:09:37   | So either way, I'm real proud of it and it's done, it's out.                                           |
| 01:09:42   | There's going to be an initial, it's going to have an initial discount price once it                   |
| 01:09:49   | goes out.                                                                                              |
| 01:09:50   | If you want to get the details, I think it's going to be releasing next Wednesday.                     |
| 01:09:55   | So I'm not exactly sure.                                                                               |
| 01:09:56   | I don't want to, but it'll be out a day or two before Iowa's 13 drops and the best way                 |
| 01:10:03   | to get information about it, if you're listening to the show, the show comes out on Friday,            |
| 01:10:07   | go to macsparky.com, just sign up for the newsletter because the newsletter people get                |
| 01:10:10   | the first notice and there will probably be a discount in the newsletter.                              |
| 01:10:14   | I'm almost certain there will be.                                                                      |
| 01:10:15   | I don't want to promise it right now because I'm still in that part of the process.                    |
| 01:10:19   | There will definitely be a separate email that goes out to everyone who bought the prior               |
| 01:10:24   | version and you will get a separate discount that'll be bigger.                                        |
| 01:10:29   | And don't worry, just check your email, I've got your name, so I'll be sending you an email            |
| 01:10:33   | with that discount code.                                                                               |
| 01:10:34   | If you already bought the first one, you'll get a discount on the second one.                          |
| 01:10:37   | And I don't know, I just feel like I'm coming up for breath now as I record this.                      |
| 01:10:40   | I feel like I'm at the happy period now where you finish something big and you're proud                |
| 01:10:46   | of it and I'm glad to be able to share it with the Automator's audience.                               |
| 01:10:49   | Well, I'm going to refill your oxygen tanks because it sounds to me that you're doing                  |
| 01:10:53   | a photos field guide next, which is going to be good fun.                                              |
| 01:10:56   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:57   | Yeah, that's always been the plan.                                                                     |
| 01:10:58   | That would have been the one that released now if shortcuts hadn't got rewritten.                      |
| 01:11:02   | I thought that'd be the one I'd be talking about.                                                      |
| 01:11:04   | That shortcuts theme, they're just so productive.                                                      |
| 01:11:07   | Anyway, it's all good and thank you everyone for all the support in the past and I hope                |
| 01:11:13   | that if you're interested in shortcuts, you check this out.                                            |
| 01:11:16   | There's going to be a bunch of, I'm going to make a bunch of them free on the website                  |
| 01:11:20   | so you can get a nice feel for it.                                                                     |
| 01:11:22   | And even if you don't buy it, at least then you'll learn something and I appreciate any                |
| 01:11:27   | support you give me.                                                                                   |
| 01:11:29   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:30   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:31   | Well, shortcuts man, they really did it this year.                                                     |
| 01:11:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:36   | Knocked out the park for the second year in a row.                                                     |
| 01:11:38   | I am impressed.                                                                                        |
| 01:11:40   | So congratulations to the shortcuts team and thank you because this has given us so much               |
| 01:11:45   | fun stuff to talk about and I'm sorry people, we're not going to shut up about shortcuts.              |
| 01:11:49   | It's not going to be every single episode, but it's a big thing and there are so many                  |
| 01:11:55   | people out there with iPhones and or iPads and it's going to be on every single one of                 |
| 01:12:00   | them from the end of the month, so I think it's worth the discussion.                                  |
| 01:12:05   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:06   | When we had the meet up at [[WWDC]], a large portion of the shortcuts team came to the meet up and           |
| 01:12:15   | the thing that was surprising for me was number one, the number of people on the team                  |
| 01:12:19   | that is a big team and number two is the eagerness that they have to find out where are we hitting     |
| 01:12:27   | roadblocks and how can they make it better?                                                            |
| 01:12:29   | They so much want to make this a thing and I know that even though it's part of the                    |
| 01:12:35   | operating system now, we probably aren't going to get the big updates during the year.                 |
| 01:12:40   | I feel like they're going to be working on it very hard and I can't wait to see what                   |
| 01:12:43   | they do next, but in the meantime, there's a bunch of automation to build.                             |
| 01:12:48   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:49   | And as the team said, when we met them, please, if you find something that doesn't work or             |
| 01:12:54   | as you expect it to or you're missing something, file feedback because I know at the very least        |
| 01:13:00   | they have the intention of looking at all the feedback that they receive.                              |
| 01:13:04   | At the moment, it's still being triaged and the things that affect multiple people are                 |
| 01:13:08   | being forwarded rather than one-off requests, but they intend to go through all of it.                 |
| 01:13:14   | I just have had to stay intent to go through all of that feedback, it gives me the good                |
| 01:13:19   | feels.                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:20   | And I know that Apple's watching how much this gets used and I think the future of                     |
| 01:13:25   | shortcuts is partly dependent on user usage, so everybody needs to be trying this out.                 |
| 01:13:32   | As Rose said earlier in the show, you can build shortcuts for grandma.                                 |
| 01:13:38   | Grandma may not want to buy the field guide and figure all this stuff out herself, but                 |
| 01:13:43   | grandma may love it if you put a sticker on her refrigerator that she can tap her phone                |
| 01:13:48   | on and it opens up her grocery list for her.                                                           |
| 01:13:52   | It's something you could do the next time you visit her and she will think that you                    |
| 01:13:56   | are amazing when you do that.                                                                          |
| 01:14:00   | So think about now that it's on all the phones, how can we help get other people using this            |
| 01:14:05   | as well?                                                                                               |
| 01:14:06   | I know for me, those NFC stickers, those can work on other people's phones too, and you                |
| 01:14:13   | can have different automations on every phone.                                                         |
| 01:14:16   | The automation is not embedded in the sticker, the sticker is just the trigger.                        |
| 01:14:20   | So if I put one on the door jam, I can make it do something for me when I tap on it, but               |
| 01:14:24   | when my wife taps on it, I can make it do something entirely different on her phone.                   |
| 01:14:29   | Maybe she walks in and she gets a different kind of music or whatever, and that's something            |
| 01:14:34   | we can all be doing for folks.                                                                         |
| 01:14:36   | So spread the good word about the shortcuts.                                                           |
| 01:14:40   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:41   | Cover your house, your car, your folders, your laptops with NFC stickers, and yeah, let's              |
| 01:14:47   | dive in and have some fun.                                                                             |
| 01:14:48   | I just got thinking, Rose, when I get these keychains, I could like put them in the pockets            |
| 01:14:55   | of certain coats, like embed them in clothing.                                                         |
| 01:14:59   | So when you put your phone in your pocket, it just does stuff?                                         |
| 01:15:02   | Yeah, I'm not sure exactly.                                                                            |
| 01:15:03   | It's just an idea now.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:04   | I'm not sure what that means, but like if I get my raincoat out, maybe I have it do                    |
| 01:15:08   | something when I put it in my pocket.                                                                  |
| 01:15:11   | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 01:15:12   | All right, well.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:13   | I mean, you could have if you're at home, it could play its raining men, but I'm not                   |
| 01:15:18   | sure if you want that.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:19   | Well, it doesn't rain here very often, so it wouldn't happen.                                          |
| 01:15:22   | My raincoat doesn't, my raincoat is like 30 years old and it looks like it's brand new.                |
| 01:15:27   | Well, there you go.                                                                                    |

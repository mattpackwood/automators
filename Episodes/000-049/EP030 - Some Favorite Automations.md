| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators. I'm David Sparks, joined by my pal, Rose Mary Orchard. How are            |
| 00:07      | you today, Rose?                                                                                     |
| 00:08      | I am very, very happy because I get to talk to you again. And while it's not as fun as               |
| 00:13      | seeing each other in person as we did a couple of weeks ago, it's still pretty good.                 |
| 00:16      | Yeah, it's funny. All my podcasts, I love making, but today I just woke up second, let's do          |
| 00:22      | some automation today. And we got a great show for you. Rose and I have both kind of looked          |
| 00:27      | at recently built automations we've made to solve some interesting problems. And we're               |
| 00:32      | going to walk you through all those. And I'm looking forward to getting started. But before          |
| 00:36      | I do, I just wanted to take a moment to talk about the Relay FM membership drive. Now we             |
| 00:41      | don't ask about membership on Relay too often, but every year in August we do. And guess             |
| 00:47      | what? It's August again. So this month we'll be celebrating Relay's fifth birthday and               |
| 00:52      | what a five years it's been. We're so thankful to have you with us, whether you've been with         |
| 00:57      | Relay for five years or five weeks, whether you've been listening to automators for one              |
| 01:02      | week or for our entire run, we really appreciate it. And if you enjoy listening to this show,        |
| 01:08      | we'd love you to become a member by signing up to a membership. You get access to the                |
| 01:12      | monthly behind the scenes newsletter, some cool 5k desktop wallpapers of your favourite               |
| 01:19      | Relay FM show artwork. And to be honest, Rose, the automator artwork is awesome and it looks         |
| 01:24      | amazing on a desktop. It's like a combination of automation and Captain America all rolled           |
| 01:31      | in one.                                                                                              |
| 01:32      | Yes, it's so much fun. I really like it. I actually have my desktop background switch                |
| 01:35      | between the Relay artwork at the moment. It's a great film.                                          |
| 01:39      | Yeah, they have a monthly Relay FM host crossover show. If you're a subscriber, I've been on         |
| 01:43      | that many times. I know you have as well, Rose.                                                      |
| 01:46      | They have a discounted merch in the new merch store. So you get that. And best of all, you           |
| 01:53      | get access to the feed of full bonus episodes. Relay FM shows published throughout August            |
| 01:59      | and September. And membership started just $5 a month. And Rose, we're not going to share            |
| 02:04      | what our bonus episode is, but I'm so excited about it that I really like. Can I have permission     |
| 02:10      | to share, Rose?                                                                                      |
| 02:11      | Oh, you're going to spoil the surprise, aren't you? Yes, I am. You always do. Go ahead and           |
| 02:17      | have this full surprise.                                                                             |
| 02:18      | So here's the thing, guys. Rose and I are going to be together in San Francisco for                  |
| 02:22      | the Relay 5th anniversary thing. In fact, they're playing Family Feud live on stage.                 |
| 02:28      | And the only thing I hope is that Rose is not on the team opposite of me because I feel              |
| 02:32      | like you have that killer instinct and...                                                            |
| 02:34      | I don't know. I have a feeling I'm going to be terrible at this. So who knows?                       |
| 02:38      | I don't know, but I just... I'm a little nervous. I don't want to be against you, whatever.          |
| 02:43      | I'm a lover, not a fighter. But anyway, so we're going to be up there. And we're going               |
| 02:47      | to be up there with a friend of ours, [[Sal Soghoian]] and his lovely wife, Naomi. And who                |
| 02:54      | is... [[Sal Soghoian\|Sal]] is the guy. He's the one who was at [[Apple]] for all those years behind [AppleScript](https://AppleScript)                 |
| 02:58      | and [Automator](https://Automator). And now he's outside the company doing other stuff. And we thought,            |
| 03:03      | let's do something with Sal for this bonus episode. And let's do something fun. And                  |
| 03:08      | so we decided a board game, but it had to be a board game that involved automation.                  |
| 03:13      | So guys, we are going to play [Mousetrap]([Mouse Trap (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Trap_(board_game))) with [[Sal Soghoian]].                                            |
| 03:18      | Yeah. It's going to be so much fun. And just to make it even more fun, we're going to do             |
| 03:23      | our best. No complete promises, but we're going to try to also do it as a video episode              |
| 03:29      | so that you can watch me lose so terribly, because the only time I've ever played this               |
| 03:35      | game, I lost really badly.                                                                           |
| 03:37      | Well, when I was a kid, I didn't have it. A friend of mine had it, but all he would                  |
| 03:40      | do is go in his room and set up the Mousetrap. I've never actually played the game. I have           |
| 03:45      | no ideas what the rules are. [[Sal Soghoian\|Sal]] had never heard the game at all. So I don't know what's             |
| 03:52      | going to happen, but it's going to be fun. So that's something to look forward to if                 |

| 04:19      | Yes. Well, we're going to have some fun, but we've had some fun recently, right?                     |
| 04:24      | Yeah. Well, we've been automating some problems. And so we have a little bit of a grab bag           |
| 04:30      | this episode, but there's some cool ones in here. And we thought we'd start from the easiest         |
| 04:35      | and go to the hardest.                                                                               |
| 04:37      | Yes. So I'm going to start the show with, I recently decided to change my throw a email              |
| 04:45      | address. So I have over the years had a variety of different email addresses, which I've used        |
| 04:52      | to varying its senses, the ones that you sign up to stuff with. So the email that's not              |
| 04:57      | to me as a person ends up going there. And I recently decided that I was going to consolidate        |
| 05:01      | all of this and put it all in one place. But I'll have it die hard and especially typing             |
| 05:07      | memory apparently is for me impossible to change. So I decided that I was going to change            |
| 05:11      | my [[TextExpander]] snippets that expanded to these email addresses to one email address                |
| 05:17      | that I'm now using. So even if I type the [[TextExpander]] snippet for the old one, I now               |
| 05:21      | get the new email address, which is super helpful. Because also then when I can't look               |
| 05:26      | into a website, I realise what the problem is and I look and I change my email address               |
| 05:30      | and I'm done.                                                                                        |
| 05:31      | Well, that's a simple automation.                                                                    |
| 05:33      | Yeah, it is. But it's actually made my life so much easier because I kept trying to type             |
| 05:40      | the old email addresses and then going, Oh, no, actually, I wanted to change the email               |
| 05:43      | address. So yeah, I just decided to change my TextExpander snippet. So I am trying to               |
| 05:49      | remember to type the snippet for the new email address all the time instead of defaulting            |
| 05:54      | to the older ones that I've previously been using. But even if I if I forget or I'm tired,           |
| 06:00      | you know, it just works. So I'm coming out 100% on top there.                                        |
| 06:05      | Yeah, a sandbox does such a good job for me that I don't have a throwaway email address              |
| 06:11      | anymore.                                                                                             |
| 06:12      | Well, I'm using G Suite for my domain. So I decided that I would use one of the addresses            |
| 06:19      | on my domain for, you know, all this other stuff. And then, you know, the people who                 |
| 06:23      | I love get my real email address, which is working really well. At some point in the                 |
| 06:28      | future, I may consolidate everything to one email address. But I quite like having it                |
| 06:33      | going to two email addresses. It just means that, you know, I know that it's a person                |
| 06:38      | if it comes to my personal email address.                                                            |
| 06:40      | Yeah, that makes sense. I have one that involves email as well. And this is a simple one. But        |
| 06:48      | you know, as I mentioned, I know I mentioned on the MPU, but I don't know if I mentioned             |
| 06:51      | it here, but I have a base camp account. And I started kind of lukewarm toward it, but               |
| 06:56      | I really warmed up to it. It helps me manage the projects for some of my legal clients,              |
| 07:02      | not all of them, but some of them. And then it also helps me with the field guide management         |
| 07:07      | because I've got someone helping me with editing and, you know, various bits and pieces. So          |
| 07:12      | I've got all these base camp projects. And in base camp, there is a feature where they               |
| 07:20      | can give you a magic email address and anything you blind copy or even send directly to that         |
| 07:26      | magic email address gets saved to the base camp project. And for some of the like the                |
| 07:31      | transactional stuff I work on as an attorney, there's a bunch of emails flying back and              |
| 07:36      | forth. And I've never really been happy with having a system to hold all of those together,          |
| 07:43      | you know, you could make a separate folder and copy them into a folder on IMAP, but who              |
| 07:49      | wants to do that, right? I mean, there's some tagging systems on, you know, the email systems        |
| 07:56      | like mail tags works, but mail tags doesn't work on iOS. So then, you know, you'd have               |
| 08:00      | to wait until you get back to the Mac to tag the email. And I've tried that and never really         |
| 08:06      | sticks for me. So it's just, you know, this is a problem I've never had a good solution              |
| 08:11      | for. And I know there's others out there, but base camp is where I invested and that's               |
| 08:15      | where I went. So I want to start saving all these emails to these various projects. And              |
| 08:21      | the trouble is, and the way you do it is you save a contact in the name of that special              |
| 08:28      | email address. I don't save it in the name of the person or the company. I just actually             |
| 08:33      | make one called, you know, ACME company, ACME contract slash base camp, you know, and that's         |
| 08:40      | a contact. And I have a separate group in my iCloud contacts list called base camp contacts.         |
| 08:47      | And so I have to go in there. And every time I have a new project to set up, you have to             |
| 08:51      | go base camp, you have to copy the email, and then you have to open the contacts app, right?         |
| 08:55      | And every time you open the contacts app, I think a puppy dies because, you know, it's               |
| 08:59      | there's so much involved with creating a new contact in the contacts app, you know, a lot            |
| 09:04      | of buttons to push and you got to land the mouse in exactly the right place. And then,               |
| 09:09      | but then there's this great app called card hop, you know, and I did some videos for them            |
| 09:13      | that it was made by some friends of mine, the same people who make fantastic. But it's               |
| 09:17      | a great app and it's on the Mac. And that makes it somewhat easier because they have                 |
| 09:21      | like just like fantastic how they've got this collection box, you just type stuff into it            |
| 09:25      | and then it creates a card. But still you have to type a bunch of stuff and you have                 |
| 09:29      | to get the right, you have to get it into the right group and it's still a little fiddly.            |
| 09:35      | So I decided I want to automate this further. So I have a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script. And it's          |
| 09:43      | called I call it new base camp reference email, very sexy name. And so what I do is I when           |
| 09:49      | I set up a new project in base camp, I grab the magic email for that project and just                |
| 09:55      | save it to the copy buffer. And then I, I push a few keys on my keyboard and it fires                |
| 10:02      | off this base camp reference email script. First thing it does is it opens up card hop.              |
| 10:08      | I mean, sometimes it's not open and if it's not open, you know, the whole thing breaks.              |
| 10:13      | And then it gives me a prompt for user input, you know, so it's asking me, you know, what's          |
| 10:18      | the name of the project. And I just type in the name as I want it to go into my contact              |
| 10:23      | cards. And I'll just, you know, so usually, like I said, it'll be something like ACME                |
| 10:27      | contract and always ends in a hyphen and then base camp, you know, at the end. So and then           |
| 10:35      | then it does the rest on its own. So what it does, it takes that input. And it's something           |
| 10:40      | similar to what you did. I remember you had at one point, I think made calendar entries              |
| 10:46      | out of a spreadsheet by grabbing fields. This is something like that. But they're the spreadsheet    |
| 10:50      | part's not there. So it opens up card hop. And then it just as soon as card hop is open,             |
| 10:57      | the cursor is automatically in that capture field they have. So I don't have to do any               |
| 11:01      | fancy, you know, gymnastics to get the mouse in the right place or set the cursor or press           |
| 11:07      | the tab key, it's just automatically there. So then I just paste in the variable that                |
| 11:13      | the base camp project name that I just typed in, then I have a space, and then I paste               |
| 11:18      | in the system clipboard, which is holding that magic email address I had copied. And                 |
| 11:23      | then it types the magic incantation, you know, backslash, base camp filings, which gets it           |
| 11:28      | into the right group. And then it pauses point two seconds because that is what you do with          |
| 11:34      | [[Keyboard Maestro]]. And then it hits the return key. And so it's not a massively complicated           |
| 11:42      | script, you know, it's capturing one piece of data from the user. It's pasting the clipboard.        |
| 11:48      | But it's just doing all this with a couple keystrokes. So it's much faster. It's much                |
| 11:56      | faster than doing it in contacts the way you know, I initially tried it. And it's slightly           |
| 12:01      | faster than doing it manually through card hop. But it just makes me happy every time                |
| 12:05      | I make the script run. And I make a lot of projects because I have client contracts coming           |
| 12:10      | on all the time. So I run the script probably once every two or three days. And I really             |
| 12:16      | like it. And then then on the back end, like I said, when I'm sending an email, I just               |
| 12:21      | go into the blank copy field, and I'll type ACME and it always, you know, [[Apple Mail]] will            |
| 12:25      | find that that's close enough. And if it really has trouble finding it, I'll hit base camp.          |
| 12:30      | And then it'll ACME space B for base camp. And then it'll definitely find it. And then               |
| 12:36      | when emails come in from other people, I just forward them to the magic base camp. And then          |
| 12:40      | I've got a nice collection of all the emails related to the project with very little effort.         |
| 12:46      | That's great. So they get saved in the, so base camp has a messages, I think it's called,            |
| 12:52      | do they get saved there? Or do they get saved to documents in base camp?                             |
| 12:55      | They have an email. They have an email. It doesn't show up by default in the base camp               |
| 12:59      | project list. But if you go into a base camp project and say, you know, change this, it's            |
| 13:06      | a little text at the bottom. I forget what the magic term is. I can look it up.                      |
| 13:09      | Change tools, add email forwards. There you go. That's it. And then you just                         |
| 13:13      | paste that in there and you're good. And like what I always do is I put that one, I put              |
| 13:19      | the email in and I take the checkups out because clients hate getting emails about checkups          |
| 13:26      | on projects. Oh yeah, because they don't need to check in. They want you to check in with            |
| 13:30      | them. Yeah, exactly. And I just don't find much                                                      |
| 13:32      | use for that. And I was doing that so much that I finally just made a new template. So               |
| 13:37      | I don't have to go through that process over and over again.                                         |
| 13:40      | That makes sense. Yeah, I really like that.                                                          |
| 13:44      | I haven't really thought it through a little bit for, I think the next step of automation            |
| 13:47      | for this would be for me to perhaps use an [[Apple Mail]] rule to look at subject lines                  |
| 13:54      | and senders to say like if an email comes in from this particular person who's maybe                 |
| 14:00      | counsel on the other side of a contract we're negotiating, I'm only going to get emails              |
| 14:05      | from that guy on the Acme contract. So if I get an email from him, just go ahead and                 |
| 14:10      | forward it to the Magic Basecamp email address. I could do that with an [[Apple Mail]] rule.             |
| 14:15      | You could. I would be a little cautious of doing that purely because of the legal standpoint.        |
| 14:21      | That person then ends up emailing you about something else six months in the future and              |
| 14:25      | it accidentally gets put in the old person's, in the old projects base camp. Yeah, you would         |
| 14:31      | have to be super on top of those mail rules. Well, first of all, it's not going to archive           |
| 14:37      | the email. All it's doing is just sending it, making the copy to base camp automatically.            |
| 14:42      | And then honestly, rarely do I negotiate a contract, two different contracts with the                |
| 14:49      | same person. It's always somebody different. But I can't think of once in my 25 years of             |
| 14:56      | doing this that I've, it just usually doesn't happen. But either way, no, that makes sense.          |
| 15:01      | And honestly, I don't know if it's worth the trouble. I mean, because how many emails                |
| 15:06      | do I get when I do a contract somewhere between five and 20? And maybe I should automate it,         |
| 15:13      | I don't know. But either way, I don't go to that extra step, but it's available to me.               |
| 15:17      | I mean, what I would do if I were you is I would totally create a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro             |
| 15:23      | where you have a palette that shows up when you're a mail and it lets you just click forward         |
| 15:29      | to ACME contract, forward to Zoo contract. And then it would automatically forward it                |
| 15:35      | pasted in the address and come out shifty or something like that.                                    |
| 15:39      | Yeah. Although it's just not that much more work to hit the keyboard shortcut to forward             |
| 15:45      | and just type a couple of letters. Exactly. Yeah. I'm just thinking if there's a palette             |
| 15:49      | from [[Keyboard Maestro]] that's showing up on your screen while you're doing this, when                 |
| 15:53      | you're in mail, because then you just click the button and it opens it up and does it                |
| 15:57      | for you and then you're on the next mail. Yeah. The other thing I do with this, and                  |
| 16:00      | this is one I believe I've shared on the show. And it's a TextExpander snippet that just            |
| 16:05      | grabs the message URL for the active email or the currently selected email. And I tied               |
| 16:13      | it to a TextExpander command E-Link, E-L-I-N-K. So if I type E-L-I-N-K, no matter what app          |
| 16:20      | I'm in, it looks at my [[Apple Mail]] program and says, oh, this is the message he has selected.         |
| 16:25      | And so if I'm taking some notes and [[Apple Notes]] about something I'm working on, and                  |
| 16:31      | I'll say source email, and then I have a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script that selects that, creates          |
| 16:39      | hyperlink and then types E-Link. And so I'm combining [[Keyboard Maestro]] and TextExpander.            |
| 16:46      | It's like chocolate and peanut butter. But the idea at the end is that I've got a link               |
| 16:51      | back to the source email anytime I want. So if I come back and look at it in six months,             |
| 16:55      | I can just click it and it opens up the source email. Yeah, that's the great thing about             |
| 16:59      | mail that you have those automated links back. Yeah. That is, okay. Well, I think I have             |
| 17:04      | some automations to steal because I use Basecamp with a couple of teams. And I can imagine           |
| 17:11      | that the email would be very helpful there. I'm currently using a Rube gold machine of               |
| 17:15      | [[Drafts]] goes to Zapier, which goes to Basecamp to post stuff into Basecamp. Yeah. Well, I             |
| 17:20      | can see how that would work. I'll tell you, Basecamp is a lot, you know, when I first                |
| 17:25      | got it, I wasn't sure if it was right for me, but it's grown on me. I'm really happy                 |
| 17:30      | to be using it. Good. This episode of Automators is brought                                          |
| 17:35      | to you by Creative Next. The Creative Next podcast just launched its second season focused           |
| 17:40      | on future proofing creatives from AI automation. Season two is about communication. How do           |
| 17:47      | humans communicate with each other? How do we communicate with machines? And how do                  |
| 17:52      | machines communicate without us? They're exploring the automation of things like storytelling,       |
| 17:57      | smart environments, and marketing and advertising. It'll explore all those interesting questions     |
| 18:02      | you might have wondered about AI, like how far away is AI from writing the next great                |
| 18:08      | novel? And what happens when smart home has become smart workplaces? Creative Next is                |

| 18:53      | everything, and let them know you heard about it here on the Automators.                             |
| 18:57      | All right. Well, let's dive back in. So both you and I went to Macstock recently, and I              |
| 19:03      | talked about Siri and about shortcuts and how you can make it do amazing things for                  |
| 19:07      | you. And after my talk, I ran into Brody, who hopefully is listening to this episode.                |
| 19:12      | He's a News News fan, Automators fan. And he was showing me his shortcuts that he               |
| 19:17      | had to play albums by a specific artist, because albums tend to be built to tell a story, you        |
| 19:23      | know, their songs are supposed to lead into one another, they're put together for a reason.          |
| 19:28      | And very understandably, he likes listening to them like that. But his current setup of              |
| 19:32      | shortcuts have become a little bit unwieldy, difficult to maintain and difficult to manage.          |
| 19:38      | And as soon as I saw this, my brain started going, hmm, I wonder if I can find a different           |
| 19:45      | way to do this, which is much easier to maintain, which is also automated, even more automated       |
| 19:51      | than using shortcuts. And so I sat there, and a couple of people actually came along                 |
| 19:56      | and listened, and the shortcuts spread around quite quickly. I think about 20 people left            |
| 20:01      | Macstock with them. Because I created three shortcuts in the end, one which maintains                |
| 20:07      | the artists, one which maintains the albums, and then the third one, which is the one that           |
| 20:11      | you use all the time, which actually does the playing. And this is not something I'd                 |
| 20:18      | ever thought of myself, but it turns out I've been using it all the time since I got back            |
| 20:22      | from Macstock. So my first one, it just creates a list of all of the artists, and it also            |
| 20:29      | creates a folder where you then save all the information about the albums for each artist.           |
| 20:35      | And so it goes through and it lets you set it up as well. So it creates a folder, creates            |
| 20:42      | your list of artists for you, and you type in the list of artists. So you may have,                  |
| 20:47      | for example, Eiffel 65 with Blue Dabba Dee Dabba Die or something in there, but you may              |
| 20:52      | not want to just play that album again and again because it's a single, and after a while            |
| 20:58      | it gets a little annoying. So you choose which artists you want to do by typing them in,             |
| 21:04      | and then the next shortcut lets you pick an artist to update your albums for them. And               |
| 21:08      | it picks all the these out of your music library. So if you have, for example, the entire Beatles    |
| 21:12      | collection, then once you tap on the Beatles, it will find every artist by every album by            |
| 21:18      | the Beatles and save this into a text file. And then your third one will go, Hey, these              |
| 21:25      | are lists. This is all of the artists that you have albums for. And so you pick your                 |
| 21:30      | artist, and then you pick the album from the text file, and then it just plays. So ideally,          |
| 21:38      | you put your third shortcut, there's third shortcut in your shortcuts widget, this is                |
| 21:41      | where mine is, and you tap on it, you pick an artist, you pick an album, and then you're             |
| 21:45      | done and you just get to listen. And I am really enjoying using this.                                |
| 21:50      | Yeah, I mean, that's pretty cool. So and you may, I saw a collection of people around you            |
| 21:54      | while you're working on shortcuts. This is the one, right?                                           |
| 21:57      | Yeah, yeah, this is the one. I mean, I did some other things helping some other people               |
| 22:00      | out as well. There were some questions about the difference between open URL and X callback          |
| 22:05      | URL. But it was, it was really interesting to see how many people were interested in                 |
| 22:10      | this. And it wasn't a use case I personally thought I had, but it turns out I actually               |
| 22:14      | do have it. And I've been using it all the time. So I'm really grateful to Brody for                 |
| 22:17      | bringing up this idea. And I'm really glad I got the chance to share back with him with              |
| 22:22      | some updated shortcuts that should make his life a little bit easier, because it does                |
| 22:27      | grab all of the artists that you have in your [[Apple Music]] Library for that artist, the ones          |
| 22:34      | that you've got saved offline. That's how the shortcuts music integration works. And                 |
| 22:39      | for that, it's great because if there's an album by an artist that you don't like, well,             |
| 22:42      | you probably haven't got it offline on your iPhone. So I, yeah, I found it to be quite               |
| 22:49      | a neat solution once I figured it out.                                                               |
| 22:52      | Is that, can you share a shortcut for, can you share that shortcut for the show?                     |
| 22:55      | Yes, absolutely. So I'm going to put together a blog post on this because it's a little              |
| 22:59      | complicated and you do need all three shortcuts. And the first time you run it, you have to          |
| 23:04      | run them in order. But once you're done, yeah, it works perfectly. And it's really simple            |
| 23:10      | to use.                                                                                              |
| 23:11      | All right. Well, I've been thinking about shortcuts to a lot lately. I'm still working               |
| 23:15      | on the new shortcuts field guide. And it's currently, I've got 60 videos recorded. And               |
| 23:23      | maybe another 30 or 40. It's crazy, Rose. There's so much.                                           |
| 23:27      | Oh, wow.                                                                                             |
| 23:28      | I know. I don't know how to stop myself. There's just so much to cover. But anyway,                  |
| 23:31      | that's going to be ready when iOS 13 comes out, if all goes to plan. But I've been doing,            |
| 23:37      | on the legal side, I've been doing a deal where there have been a bunch of in-person                 |
| 23:43      | and telephonic meetings with this group of people. And, you know, I have the way I take              |
| 23:48      | notes from the meeting, but it's like I had to start stretching some of my old muscles               |
| 23:51      | when I worked with a bunch of other people. And now I work for myself. Usually it's not              |
| 23:55      | as big of a deal, but now I've got collaborators. I've got other professionals that are working      |
| 23:59      | on this deal with me. And the first couple of meetings we had, like we've made progress              |
| 24:05      | but nobody documented anything and nothing seemed to get done. So I decided to take the              |
| 24:10      | bull by the horns. And I've been going to these meetings largely with iPad. I don't                  |
| 24:14      | normally have a laptop with me. And so I wanted to make an iOS meeting solution. And so I            |
| 24:20      | ended up making two scripts and I'll share these. Maybe I'll even share videos. I think              |
| 24:25      | I'm going to make videos of these for the next field guide. Maybe I'll just put them                 |
| 24:28      | in up as well. So you guys will get a preview of the next field guide. So the first thing            |
| 24:34      | it does, I guess I should open it so I can look at it. But the first thing it is is when             |
| 24:39      | I go into a meeting, I run the meeting beginning shortcut. And the first thing it is is throws       |
| 24:45      | the do not disturb switch. So I don't have to get interrupted. You don't want to be sitting          |
| 24:50      | in there and have calls come in or something. And I call it meeting mode. And then I just            |
| 24:57      | run a couple of things. The first, I'm collecting data then at this point. So the idea of the        |
| 25:02      | script is to run and then get a kick off point for writing down notes during the meeting.            |
| 25:09      | And I've been using [[Apple Notes]] for it. With iOS 13 beta, I've been using [[Apple Notes]]                |
| 25:14      | a lot more. You know, now that you have nested folders and you can create them on the iOS            |
| 25:18      | device, I feel like I'm going to be doing more on [[Apple Notes]] than I used to. So anyway,             |
| 25:24      | so the first thing it does is it turns on do not disturb. And I turn it on just until                |
| 25:28      | I leave, you know, because you can do that, which is kind of nice. And then the next thing           |
| 25:33      | I do is I grab the current date. And, you know, that's going to be used in the minutes.              |
| 25:39      | And then I have a list choice. So you have a list. Because this is with the same people              |
| 25:44      | all the time. I just have a display list and then choose from list to commands. I guess              |
| 25:50      | I could do this as an array with different groups of people if I was doing it with different         |
| 25:54      | groups. But since it's always the same four or five people, I'm just using a choose from             |
| 25:58      | list command. And so you're collecting all those people and it's got the list of like                |
| 26:04      | five people, but then you can tap on the ones that are actually at the meeting because sometimes     |
| 26:09      | one person or another isn't there. And then it does a scripting call just to say, you                |
| 26:15      | know, what's the subject of the meeting and you type in the subject. And then it just                |
| 26:19      | creates a text file that says meeting minutes. And then it puts the date and it inserts the          |
| 26:22      | date from that date call. And it inserts the subject from the subject call. And then it              |
| 26:27      | puts down a list of attendees, you know, from the, the choose from list. And then it types           |
| 26:33      | in, you know, items discussed and action items. And it drops that into an Apple note and it          |
| 26:39      | opens into [[Apple Notes]]. So that's all it does. I mean, it just grabs some information and            |
| 26:44      | creates the note with all the basics in it. And then I type in the note as we're talking             |
| 26:48      | to the meeting and at the end of the meeting, I summarise the action items and who's going           |
| 26:54      | to do them. And I type them into this document. So that's the first script. And then the second      |
| 26:59      | piece of it is the meeting ending script. And what that does is it grabs the Apple note              |
| 27:07      | and it emails it to everybody that attended. It's the same thing. You select the people,             |
| 27:12      | you create an email, it sends it out. And it's got the action items for everybody at                 |
| 27:17      | the bottom. I love that part, right? You know, yeah. And then so, and they get it, like,             |
| 27:22      | they get it before we leave the room, because I just run this, this shortcut. And then the           |
| 27:28      | last piece of it is it opens up OmniFocus for me into the inbox for whatever action items            |
| 27:34      | I took on. So I just record them to OmniFocus right as I'm sitting there. I haven't figured          |
| 27:40      | out yet how to automate grabbing the text out of the note for my action items. You know,             |
| 27:45      | that'd be cool if I could do that.                                                                   |
| 27:47      | Well, have you also considered trying to find the names that the attendees in the note so            |
| 27:52      | that you don't have to tap the same people again?                                                    |
| 27:55      | Oh, for the, yeah, I could do that. I could do that. That would work. But usually what               |
| 28:01      | I do actually with this group is I send the notes, the meeting minutes to everybody, even            |
| 28:05      | the people that don't show up.                                                                       |
| 28:06      | Oh, okay. Oh, that makes sense, yeah.                                                                |
| 28:08      | But you know, sometimes automation, you kind of like cross the third rail when you start             |
| 28:13      | getting too deep and like, oh, I want to get my action items, just the ones that have my             |
| 28:17      | name next to it and create OmniFocus tasks. I guess there's probably a way to do that                |
| 28:20      | if I thought about it long enough.                                                                   |
| 28:22      | Well, if you grab the whole notes and then you split it and go through each line, repeat             |
| 28:26      | with each and then if it starts with, I believe that's an option in Shortcuts. I just open           |
| 28:31      | Shortcuts and my Shortcuts is empty. This is scary.                                                  |
| 28:35      | Uh-oh.                                                                                               |
| 28:36      | It's okay before starting.                                                                           |
| 28:39      | Because then when I need to do the step of going through OmniFocus, because like my description      |
| 28:44      | in the minutes to people isn't exactly how I'm going to describe it. And maybe I'll write            |
| 28:49      | down one thing on the minutes, but it actually turns into five OmniFocus tasks and some of           |
| 28:53      | them are flagged and some of them have alarms. I think that's, I just got to use the software        |
| 28:58      | between my ears for that step.                                                                       |
| 29:01      | If you did want to just grab them out, there is actually a function in Shortcuts iOS 13              |
| 29:06      | where you can say if and then providing it's a text item you've got begins with as an option,        |
| 29:12      | which at the very least you could then pop into say an ask for input and then you could              |
| 29:16      | type the actual tasks that result from this, which then you put into your OmniFocus.                 |
| 29:22      | But either way, that's a couple scripts that are very, neither one of them are super complicated.    |
| 29:29      | Like I said, I'm going to record these for the new field guide, but I'm going to just                |
| 29:33      | put them, those recordings into this show notes and I'll put them on YouTube. But they're            |
| 29:41      | very useful ways to deal with that problem. And since I've always got an iPad when I walk            |
| 29:46      | into the meetings, now people have come to expect it, right?                                         |
| 29:51      | And then like, so now I'm typing and somebody will make a suggestion, but don't put that             |
| 29:55      | one on me. They're like fighting for turf in the meeting because they know that they're              |
| 30:00      | going to get held accountable at the end with this email. It's kind of funny the dynamics,           |
| 30:05      | how the dynamics change when you start doing that. But that's a whole other discussion.              |
| 30:08      | I'm going to have to steal this because I've been having a couple of meetings recently               |
| 30:12      | where it's been very much at the end, okay? Well, who's actually going to do what now?               |
| 30:16      | And there seems to be an expectation that I'll do everything, which is so not happening.             |
| 30:20      | So I'd really like to start assigning everything to somebody else.                                   |
| 30:24      | All right. You want to do one more?                                                                  |
| 30:26      | Well, as alluded to in the previous episode, I purchased a Mac mini. And you said that               |
| 30:34      | we were going to put a pin in it. So I'm taking the pin back out and we're going to talk about       |
| 30:37      | it because I bought this for many reasons, but one of the reasons why I bought it was for            |
| 30:43      | automation because it's just, it's sitting on my desk and it's always running. I just                |
| 30:47      | sleep the displays when I'm not using it, which also locks the screen. And there's                   |
| 30:53      | a couple of different ways. Actually, there's a lot of different ways that I'm using this            |
| 30:56      | for automation, but I thought I'd just talk about a couple of those.                                 |
| 30:59      | Can I just say one thing though? I mean, the idea of a Mac running 24 seven,                         |
| 31:04      | if you're interested in automation, it opens up the world. I mean, there's just so much more         |
| 31:10      | you can do with it. I mean, I've played with the NAS drives in the past and, you know,               |
| 31:16      | and I thought about all these solutions. But at the end of the day, having a Mac running 24 seven    |
| 31:21      | with all the cool things like [[Keyboard Maestro]], [[Apple Mail]] rules, [[Hazel]], having that running 24      |
| 31:28      | seven really can change your game for automation. So I totally understand why you got one.           |
| 31:32      | Yeah, absolutely. And also as a note, if you're on the fence about whether or not it's a good        |
| 31:37      | idea, you could try say a month of Mac stadium, I think it's $40 or $50 for a month. So it's not     |
| 31:42      | super cheap, but it's cheaper than buying a Mac mini. So you could try it for a month and see if it  |
| 31:47      | is actually useful for you. Because you can make a lot of magic happen.                              |
| 31:53      | I didn't even know that I thought you had to send them your own Mac mini.                            |
| 31:56      | No, no. So they actually, they have Mac minis. So they offer a co-location where you send them       |
| 32:02      | your own, or where you can buy one from them and they'll put it in their server centre,              |
| 32:06      | but they also have Mac minis that you can use. Yeah, they can rent in essence.                       |
| 32:11      | Yeah, exactly. So it would be a great way to try it out.                                             |
| 32:13      | Yeah. So so Rosemary Orchard now has a Mac running 24 seven. I want to know what you're doing with   |
| 32:19      | it. Well, first, the very first thing I did with it before I really got it set up with I             |
| 32:24      | got [[Stephen Hackett]] to upgrade my RAM. Yeah. This is a story that's not yet been shared on           |
| 32:28      | automators. But as people were in the lunch line at Mac stock on the Saturday, somebody was going    |
| 32:37      | down the line going, can somebody help me open an iMac? And [[Stephen Hackett]] ended up opening up      |
| 32:43      | somebody's iMac and replacing the RAM and the SSD. So I jokingly said, well, if you fancy            |
| 32:47      | doing a Mac mini tomorrow, I can bring one. And he said, yes, I check later to make sure he hadn't   |
| 32:53      | been joking. Because it was a joke. I wasn't intending to make him work. But he was happy to.        |
| 32:59      | And so has [[Stephen Hackett]] upgraded my RAM? So it's got 32 gigabytes of RAM in there. So I can       |
| 33:03      | throw all kinds of automations at this baby. And it's going to just fly. Yeah. So I've moved my      |
| 33:10      | Homebridge from a Raspberry Pi onto my Mac mini. Because my Mac mini has a dedicated IP address,    |
| 33:15      | which my Raspberry Pi didn't have. I could have made that happen. But I wanted it on my Mac mini     |
| 33:20      | for a couple of reasons, mostly easier to get into the config file and edit things.                  |
| 33:24      | So what devices do you need the Homebridge for at this point?                                       |
| 33:28      | So we have a Netatmo weather station. And we have a few plugs, which are compatible with             |
| 33:35      | Philips Hue. But they're not compatible with [[HomeKit]]. And also we have a Neato Botvac,                |
| 33:42      | which is very nice and goes around and cleans all our floors. But I wanted to add it to a [[HomeKit]]    |
| 33:46      | scene, the one where we've left, where everybody has left the house. So that it would just           |
| 33:51      | automatically run when you walk out the door and you press the button that says I'm leaving,         |
| 33:55      | that turns everything off, and it turns on the robot vacuum. So whenever we leave,                   |
| 34:00      | it cleans for us, which is really nice. Yeah. So I got [[Homebridge]] running on there as well,         |
| 34:06      | which I mentioned in our recent show about home automation. But I've also got Calibre running        |
| 34:13      | on it, which is like [[iTunes]] for ebooks. And [[Calibre]] has a function where it can watch a folder.      |
| 34:17      | It's called the watch folder function. And so I throw any ebooks that I've purchased that come       |
| 34:22      | in like EPUB format and things like that into a folder in [[Dropbox]] called add to Calibre.             |
| 34:28      | And Calibre goes, [[Yoink]], sucks it up and sticks it in my ebook library. So next time I'm getting     |
| 34:33      | books from my ebook library, they're all there, which means that when I purchase things from,        |
| 34:37      | like, take control books, I can just download them, stick them in the folder on any device,          |
| 34:41      | and they're in my ebook library ready to go. I always thought that app was called Calibre.           |
| 34:46      | I call it Calibre. I don't know which one is right. I think my pronunciation sounds pretty           |
| 34:50      | here, so I'm going to stick with it. Also, I mean, Libra, I mean, it sounds like, I don't know,      |
| 34:54      | isn't that the Latin root for both? Yeah, I assumed it was based on the Latin.                       |
| 34:58      | Yeah. So I think you're right. I got it wrong. I don't know. We'll find out. I'm sure somebody       |
| 35:03      | will write to us and tell us that we're both wrong. Yeah. I'd never thought of using that as a,      |
| 35:08      | you know, needing that to be running 24-7, but that makes sense. Well, I don't need it to be         |
| 35:13      | running 24-7, but Calibre has a built-in ebook server, which I use with Marvin on my iPad mini       |
| 35:19      | so that I can just grab ebooks and read them. And so it's really nice if all the ebooks are just     |
| 35:25      | there. And if Calibre's running all the time, why not have it watch a folder in [[Dropbox]] and          |
| 35:29      | just do some more magic for me? Yeah, I've bought so many books through [[Amazon]] that if they ever     |
| 35:34      | like shut down or lock me out, I'm screwed. Oh, yeah. I have it download all of my Kindle books      |
| 35:40      | as well and store those in Calibre as well, just so that I have everything there. Thanks,            |
| 35:46      | my love. It's a little easier. But the magic that I am particularly proud of, which was the most     |
| 35:51      | recent edition, is I'm a big [[Hazel]] user. Years ago, I bought your field guide. I've taken so many    |
| 35:57      | things from it. The matching dates was like, that was worth the price of entry alone because         |
| 36:03      | figuring that out has allowed me to automate filing of almost everything. Yeah. But today,           |
| 36:09      | as we record, I remembered that [[Joe Buhlig]] a couple of years ago wrote a script called                |
| 36:15      | [[OmniFocus]] Autoparser. And this is an [[AppleScript]] where it will pass. So you add a task to your      |
| 36:22      | OmniFocus inbox, and the script will then look at it. And any tasks that start with two dashes,      |
| 36:27      | it will then parse and do some magic on based on some certain formatting criteria. And it will       |
| 36:34      | add projects and things like that, which is perfect for what I need. Because Zapier has been adding  |
| 36:40      | a bunch of tasks to my OmniFocus for me. But of course, because the OmniFocus mail drop doesn't      |
| 36:45      | have any parsing, they just end up in my inbox, which is not necessarily where I need them to be.    |
| 36:51      | So I have changed the format of everything that gets added by Zapier. And then Zapier,               |
| 36:57      | whenever it adds a task to my OmniFocus, and this is built into a bunch of different Zaps,           |
| 37:00      | so I had to edit several Zaps, it adds a file to a certain folder in [[Dropbox]] called Parse OmniFocus. |
| 37:08      | You can see I'm super creative at naming because I am horrifically forgetful. And if you give things |
| 37:14      | a good name, then later you come back and you can look at it and go, oh, this is the thing that      |
| 37:18      | makes that script run. Yeah. The trick is never be too clever. Assume future you is a dummy.         |
| 37:24      | Exactly. Assume future you is horrifically jet-like, possibly slightly drunk, and definitely         |
| 37:29      | extremely tired. And you'll be absolutely fine. Because I'm usually in a state of either jet-like    |
| 37:36      | or exhaustion right now because I'm about to do my first trip. What about drunkenness?               |
| 37:39      | You said drunkenness for us. Well, I mean, there may be a cocktail involved. If there are four       |
| 37:43      | flights, if there are four flights involved in any trip, there will be a cocktail involved.          |
| 37:48      | Usually a non-alcoholic one, just because adding any alcohol to a trip involving four                |
| 37:53      | flights is a recipe for disaster. Yeah, I could see that. You can pretend that it's got alcohol      |
| 37:59      | and a few onto. There. Yes. So whenever this file gets added to the folder, [[Hazel]] pops up and goes,  |
| 38:07      | oh, I should run this AppleScript. And I've just put this in as an embedded AppleScript in the     |
| 38:11      | rule. And then it moves that file off to the trash. And then it's done. And this is great because    |
| 38:16      | it means that I don't have the script running 24-7 in the background because most of the tasks I     |
| 38:21      | add to OmniFocus, quite frankly, don't need this. But when I add those tasks with that formatting    |
| 38:27      | and actually some of these [[Zapier]] zaps add more than one task. And so I just add this file right     |
| 38:36      | at the end. And because my Mac is always on, it just once the file appears, it then gets on with it. |
| 38:45      | And that's perfect for me because I then get reminded that I need to add things to                   |
| 38:51      | invoices or delete folders in certain places and things like that. If I could automate these         |
| 38:56      | things, I would. But at the moment, I'm not able to do that because of a variety of reasons.         |
| 39:01      | So let me just summarise to make sure I understand. So Joe's script runs in OmniFocus.               |
| 39:08      | Yeah, exactly. And it runs on the inbox in essence. So if you add certain syntax to the              |
| 39:14      | description, it's going to create projects, tags and the like there. Exactly. Does it                |
| 39:19      | support tags? Because when he wrote that, I think they didn't have tags.                             |
| 39:23      | I believe it supports contacts, but it wouldn't be that much work to update it to support multiple   |
| 39:28      | tags. Because the way that it's set up in OmniFocus is pretty simple. But honestly,                  |
| 39:34      | with these tags, with these tasks, I literally just want them to get put into the right project.     |
| 39:40      | Because as I've mentioned before, I don't necessarily tag everything that ends up in                 |
| 39:45      | my OmniFocus because things. So for example, I work in the IT department. If I don't have a          |
| 39:50      | computer, we have serious issues and nobody's going to be expecting me to actually work.             |
| 39:56      | So for example, work, there is absolutely no point tagging all the things that need to be            |
| 40:00      | done with a computer because that's 99.9% of my work anyway. So I tag the things explicitly          |
| 40:05      | don't need a computer or don't need network access because almost everything needs it.               |
| 40:11      | So then you're using the OmniFocus mail drop from Zapier to create a bunch of inbox items on         |
| 40:18      | whatever Zapier project you just created. And then at the same time, Zapier creates the text         |
| 40:25      | file. Now the text file with [[Hazel]], and this is covered in the video, the field guide. But [[Hazel]],    |
| 40:33      | one of the tricks with [[Hazel]] is you have a look for a text file. And if it sees it,                  |
| 40:38      | then that's enough to trigger it to do something. And in your case, you're saying,                   |
| 40:42      | do two things. First, delete the text file. And then second.                                         |
| 40:45      | Actually, I tell it to run the script first and then delete the text file because I don't            |
| 40:49      | sync my [[Hazel]] rules between Macs, at least not for everything. There are a couple of things where    |
| 40:53      | I do. So then it runs the script and then delete the text file and then [[Hazel]] just keeps watching    |
| 40:59      | for the next time. And then when it runs the script, it goes into OmniFocus. It parses through       |
| 41:04      | your inbox and turns those inbox items into something more. Nice. Yes. I like that.                  |
| 41:10      | Yeah. Well, it seemed worth it because I'm automating adding the task anyway. And I know             |
| 41:15      | absolutely 100% where the task belongs. I just don't do it. But then of course,                      |
| 41:20      | at the end of the day, I end up sitting in my inbox going, there's an awful lot of tasks in          |
| 41:25      | here that could have been automatically categorised. Oh, that's great. That's great.                 |
| 41:28      | Because I feel the same way. Every time I have to spend time in the inbox,                           |
| 41:31      | because of a failure of automation, sometimes I just put things in there because I'm not             |
| 41:35      | sure. At the end of the day, I put stuff in the inbox and I'm like, oh, that was a dumb idea.        |
| 41:40      | And I just delete it. But sometimes the inbox serves a function. But other times,                    |
| 41:44      | you're right. It's just got dumped in there automatically. And just because I didn't have            |
| 41:47      | the mechanics to further add metadata to it, it didn't get filed. Now I have to do it                |
| 41:54      | like an animal by hand. This is great. I'm going to steal this one from you, Rose. That's great.     |
| 42:00      | Well, I want to rewrite this at some point to use the new omni-automation that's coming,             |
| 42:05      | which is hidden in the current betas if you're on the current betas. It's there. It's just           |
| 42:09      | hidden because it's not finished yet. So I'd like to rewrite it to do that. But my previous          |
| 42:13      | iteration of this was not actually using the mail drop at all. I was appending things through a      |
| 42:18      | [[Dropbox]] file. And then I had a shortcut that ideally I would run once a day that would grab          |
| 42:23      | the contents of the [[Dropbox]] file. And because it was Taskpaper format, it would just paste it into  |
| 42:28      | OmniFocus and then replace the [[Dropbox]] file with an empty file. However, the problem with this was   |
| 42:35      | I realised I wasn't running the shortcut every day. And so I was missing stuff because it wasn't     |
| 42:40      | ending up in my OmniFocus. And that, of course, was a significant failing on my side because I       |
| 42:46      | wasn't automating adding the tasks, which is why I switched back to using mail drop because then     |
| 42:49      | the very least the tasks were there. But it still wasn't perfect. And now it's getting pretty close  |
| 42:54      | to perfect with this. Yeah. Well, whenever you get around to the OmniFocus JavaScript version of     |
| 42:59      | this, let me know, I'll be your beta tester. But I well, I think there'll be a couple of people      |
| 43:03      | who want to I may actually modify it so that just handles Taskpaper instead. Yeah. Because that's   |
| 43:09      | a format that everybody's familiar with instead of the format that Joe created this before OmniFocus |
| 43:13      | supported Taskpaper, I believe. Yeah. So yeah, but I left it as it is because it works. And there's |
| 43:20      | a lot to be said for an automation that you know works. No, that's great. I like it, Rose. I like    |
| 43:25      | it. So what about things you want to automate more? I just thought we'd finish a show today.         |
| 43:31      | There's a couple of things that have been on the back of my mind lately. I'm using                   |
| 43:35      | [[Airtable]] a lot in the field guide production and a couple other things too. But particularly         |
| 43:40      | with field guides, because it's like you've got a long list of videos, you've got different people   |
| 43:44      | doing different parts of it. And it's just a great way. It's a public shared database between        |
| 43:52      | your team, which is [[Airtable]] is great for that. We did a whole show on [[Airtable]]. But I want to       |
| 43:58      | increase the automation elements of [[Airtable]] right now as it is. I basically manually go in and      |
| 44:04      | change fields and things. And really that combines with the other thing I want to get better at is   |
| 44:09      | using Zapier. You know, we did that show on Zapier. I was motivated. I created a couple of Zapier    |
| 44:15      | automations. I signed up for a subscription and I haven't done enough with it. I feel like that's    |
| 44:21      | something in the coming months I would like to try and get more out of. How about you?               |
| 44:26      | Well, I have a slight issue with email. A lot of people have heard of the same called                |
| 44:32      | inbox zero, which I used to aspire to. In the meantime, I have ended up with over 5000 emails        |
| 44:38      | in my personal inboxes and over 5000 in my work inboxes, which is approximately 10,000 emails        |
| 44:45      | that I really don't need in my inbox. But at the same time, I can't get rid of because there is      |
| 44:53      | actually important stuff lurking here somewhere. So I really need to get a handle on setting up      |
| 44:58      | filters for stuff that comes in so that I know all the newsletters are just filtered away and stuff  |
| 45:05      | like that. I've got started on this by trying to migrate everything to one email address,            |
| 45:12      | or migrate all the system stuff to one email address, but I have not really done anything            |
| 45:16      | else yet. I'm thinking I'm going to end up with a combination of server side rules and mail rules,   |
| 45:21      | but I don't know. I really need to get a handle on this because there's just so much in my inbox     |
| 45:25      | right now and it's crazy. Maybe we need to go back and do this show on that because I feel like      |
| 45:30      | I've got that problem pretty solved between my same box subscription and a lot of AppleScripts I    |
| 45:36      | use with [[Apple Mail]] on the Mac. I've talked about this on MPU, but I'm just getting where I don't    |
| 45:42      | do hardly any email on my iPhone and the stuff that gets too complicated on my iPad, I just tag      |
| 45:50      | an archive and then I just manage the tags on the Mac. I've got some ideas on that. We should        |
| 45:55      | probably do future content on that. Definitely. Let's do that. Is there anything else that you're    |
| 46:00      | looking to automate more because you mentioned Zapier. Is there anything in particular you want      |
| 46:03      | to do with Zapier? I just want to get more out of it. There's web services I use,                    |
| 46:08      | Basecamp for instance, [[Airtable]] for instance. I've got these web services that I'm plugged into      |
| 46:14      | and then I've got my online invoicing is done through an online service. I feel like I've            |
| 46:21      | done a poor job of taking advantage of all these hooks I have with Zapier and I know they're there.  |
| 46:26      | I just have to take the time to experiment with them and get them working. I've got a few of them    |
| 46:31      | working. I have a few of them that are in progress that never quite hooked up right and I just need  |
| 46:37      | to figure out what the problem is and I think I need to block some time to just go in and figure     |
| 46:43      | that out because I feel like it would save me time if I just got better using Zapier.                |
| 46:46      | Yeah, you mentioned invoicing. That's something I really need to figure out automating as well       |
| 46:51      | because I've got a lot of stuff that's running around at the moment where for example, some of       |
| 46:55      | these tasks are being added to OmniFocus are actually things to do with the invoicing system         |
| 47:00      | because I have either not figured out a way to automate things yet or there is no way to automate    |
| 47:07      | them without investing more time. I think I'm at the point where it's going to be worth investing    |
| 47:11      | more time in this so that I can actually get all this stuff automated. Sounds like we get some       |
| 47:17      | future shows here. Oh, I think we do, but the next episode is not one that we've talked about today. |
| 47:25      | People are going to have to listen in and find out who or what we're talking about.                  |
| 47:29      | Okay, well, that's it for today. We are the Automators. You can find us over at relayfm.com          |

| 47:39      | you can get that cool podcast slash hopefully video of us playing mousetrap. I'm really              |
| 47:45      | looking forward to that. I think it's going to be fun. It's going to be so much fun.                 |
| 47:49      | Yeah, exactly. Thank you to Creative Next for sponsoring the show today,                             |

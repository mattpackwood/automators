| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators.                                                                      |
| 00:04      | I'm Rosemary Orchard, and joined by my co-host, David Sparks, and we are going to talk about           |
| 00:09      | how to automate your technology to do your work for you.                                               |
| 00:11      | Hello, David.                                                                                          |
| 00:12      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                                                       |
| 00:13      | How are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:14      | I am very excited because we love having guests on the show.                                           |
| 00:17      | They teach us all sorts of things, including how to pronounce their names.                             |
| 00:21      | Did you know that?                                                                                     |
| 00:22      | Today, I hope.                                                                                         |
| 00:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:24      | Well, I did a little bit of practising.                                                                |
| 00:27      | I'm going to get this wrong because it's not Nahumck.                                                  |
| 00:31      | It is Welcome to the Show, Tim Nahumck.                                                                |
| 00:33      | I think I got that right.                                                                              |
| 00:34      | I think you did get that right.                                                                        |
| 00:36      | Very good.                                                                                             |
| 00:37      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 00:38      | Nice job.                                                                                              |
| 00:39      | Excellent.                                                                                             |
| 00:40      | Full points for me.                                                                                    |
| 00:41      | Wonderful.                                                                                             |
| 00:42      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 00:43      | Welcome to the show.                                                                                   |
| 00:44      | Well, thank you for having me.                                                                         |
| 00:45      | Tim is known as the [[Drafts]] guy.                                                                        |
| 00:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:47      | Or was it the draftsman?                                                                               |
| 00:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:49      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 00:50      | [[Stephen Hackett]] calls me the Draftsman.                                                                |
| 00:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:53      | Well, it's a good name.                                                                                |
| 00:55      | That's how a lot of people know you, though, because you love [[Drafts]].                                  |
| 00:58      | I do.                                                                                                  |
| 00:59      | I'm actually wearing a [[Drafts]] shirt right now.                                                         |
| 01:01      | Nobody can see this.                                                                                   |
| 01:02      | It makes for great audio, but I'm wearing a [[Drafts]] shirt right now because it's the                    |
| 01:06      | episode.                                                                                               |
| 01:07      | I have to represent it.                                                                                |
| 01:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09      | That would actually make two of us that are wearing [[Drafts]] t-shirts right now.                         |
| 01:12      | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 01:13      | I'm wearing the rebel logo right now.                                                                  |
| 01:17      | The rebel lines.                                                                                       |
| 01:18      | Well, I think we can let that slide, right?                                                            |
| 01:19      | Although, if we're going to talk about [[Drafts]] merch, I am in possession of some [[Drafts]]                 |
| 01:25      | stickers.                                                                                              |
| 01:26      | If you've seen me at [[WWDC]] and you're a draftsman or a draftswoman or a [[Drafts]] anything, let            |
| 01:32      | me know.                                                                                               |
| 01:33      | I will get you a sticker until I run out.                                                              |
| 01:35      | I would love to meet some [[Drafts]] unicorns at [[WWDC]] if you use [[Drafts]], come and talk                     |
| 01:40      | to us.                                                                                                 |
| 01:41      | We want to talk to you.                                                                                |
| 01:42      | Well, Tim wrote the review for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), kind of the definitive review of [[Drafts]].                   |
| 01:47      | I know you're super deep into this application and it's one of my favourite tools not only              |
| 01:53      | for just getting worked in, but also automation.                                                       |
| 01:57      | Thanks so much, Tim, for coming in today and helping us share with the listeners ways that             |
| 02:02      | you can automate your life with [[Drafts]].                                                                |
| 02:05      | I'm happy to do this.                                                                                  |
| 02:07      | What got you started with [[Drafts]]?                                                                      |
| 02:10      | How did you become the *Draftsman*?                                                                      |
| 02:11      | Were you the [[Drafts]] boy first or what happened?                                                        |
| 02:17      | For me, it's something that I think I picked it up actually probably from [[Merlin Mann]] listening         |
| 02:23      | to a podcast at some point in time and he mentioned [[Drafts]] on a show.                                  |
| 02:27      | I had been talking with a couple other people that use it and at first I was going, well,              |
| 02:31      | okay, all right, I'll just start using it.                                                             |
| 02:34      | The whole thing with [[Drafts]] is capture.                                                                |
| 02:36      | Put everything in there and then you can figure out where it goes later.                               |
| 02:40      | I jumped in at [[Drafts]] three.                                                                           |
| 02:41      | I didn't jump in from the beginning, I jumped in at [[Drafts]] three.                                      |
| 02:44      | I had been using blackberries before that, so just to go way back in history.                          |
| 02:50      | I started seeing how beneficial it could be for me and it was just simple things, just                 |
| 02:56      | moving text from one place to another was just made so much easier by [[Drafts]].                          |
| 03:02      | Then when [[Drafts]] four came out, that's when everything kind of opened up for me.                       |
| 03:07      | I really just saw the automation possibilities, even though it was small automations at the            |
| 03:12      | time and things have progressed so much farther from there, that's really when it hit home             |
| 03:17      | for me that this could be a huge tool and it's not just for one thing, it's for multiple.              |
| 03:24      | I have this vivid memory of getting started with [[Drafts]] because I was in the middle of                 |
| 03:29      | an extended jury trial at the time and I was staying at this hotel in Los Angeles because              |
| 03:34      | it was just down the street from the courthouse and I saw that it released.                            |
| 03:39      | Greg Pierce, the guy who makes [[Drafts]], had made some other apps that I was a fan of,                   |
| 03:44      | so he let me know it was coming out.                                                                   |
| 03:46      | I downloaded it on day one and it just happened that that day, when you're busy for work,              |
| 03:52      | sometimes you've got like a bunch of little things in your mind.                                       |
| 03:57      | I just opened up [[Drafts]] and just tried and I used dictation, recording emails to do items,             |
| 04:05      | just everything that was on my brain and I'll never forget sitting in the hotel lobby in               |
| 04:09      | about 15 minutes, I took care of everything and it was all [[Drafts]] because you can run                  |
| 04:17      | through and make a bunch of [[Drafts]] and for folks who haven't used it before, before we                 |
| 04:20      | get the automation stuff, the magic of [[Drafts]] is you open the app and it's a text box so               |
| 04:25      | you just start typing or dictating or doing whatever to get text in and then you can do                |
| 04:30      | simple things with them.                                                                               |
| 04:31      | Well, if you just go through and kind of batch the stuff out of your brain into this application,      |
| 04:37      | there's just nothing like it and I was a believer from the first day.                                  |
| 04:43      | And when I downloaded that, it's kind of the same thing for me.                                        |
| 04:46      | I just started putting everything in there and it was on my home screen to start and                   |
| 04:50      | now it has not left my doc since version four came out.                                                |
| 04:54      | It's there, it'll be there until Greg decides to say, I'm done with this and I'll cry in               |
| 04:59      | a corner.                                                                                              |
| 05:00      | That's what I'm going to be doing the day that he announces he's done.                                 |
| 05:02      | Well, we're going to need a support group if that happens because like both of you,                    |
| 05:07      | I end up writing so much in [[Drafts]].                                                                    |
| 05:09      | I don't necessarily start everything in [[Drafts]], but a significant portion of anything that             |
| 05:13      | I write down does start life in [[Drafts]] in one way or another.                                          |
| 05:17      | It might be dictation through my watch or it might be through the share sheet, but it                  |
| 05:22      | is just such an easy way to write stuff down because then what am I going to do with it?               |
| 05:27      | Well, you can do anything, right?                                                                      |
| 05:29      | That's the magic.                                                                                      |
| 05:30      | And we're going to get into that in the show with the automation, but I think the starting             |
| 05:34      | bit of magic is the idea of tap an icon on your iPhone or your iPad or on your Mac now.                |
| 05:42      | And there's a blinking cursor.                                                                         |
| 05:44      | There is no step in between.                                                                           |
| 05:46      | There's no creation of a new file.                                                                     |
| 05:48      | There's no navigating to a folder.                                                                     |
| 05:50      | You just open the app and it's waiting for you.                                                        |
| 05:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:55      | And I think that, I mean, even for me now, more so on the watch than anything because                  |
| 05:59      | I opened that up and you can have auto capture enabled, so it just goes right to dictation.            |
| 06:04      | And for me now, anytime I have a thought, that's what I'm doing.                                       |
| 06:09      | I'll be walking at work and I'll just, you know, I'll tap that icon and I'll just start                |
| 06:15      | talking and I can capture everything that I need to.                                                   |
| 06:19      | Sometimes it doesn't quite understand what I need, but it gets me close enough so that                 |
| 06:22      | I can remember it for later.                                                                           |
| 06:25      | And I'm only getting older.                                                                            |
| 06:27      | So for me, it's something where I need to kind of remember everything as much as I can                 |
| 06:33      | and [[Drafts]] allows me to get it out of my brain down on paper so that I don't have the mental           |
| 06:37      | overhead and the mental burden to try to remember that later.                                          |
| 06:42      | I'm not putting it in a reminder's app and tagging it with something and putting a due                 |
| 06:45      | date on it.                                                                                            |
| 06:46      | I'm just capturing that and I'll deal with it later.                                                   |
| 06:49      | And that's the, that's the whole beauty of this.                                                       |
| 06:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 06:51      | You know, some people complain about complications on the Apple watch, how they don't work well        |
| 06:56      | because so often a developer is trying to jam a very complicated app into a very small                 |
| 07:01      | screen with no buttons.                                                                                |
| 07:05      | And [[Drafts]] is one of the exceptions to that because like Tim was saying, [[Drafts]] is kind                |
| 07:12      | of like a great candidate for a on-face complication on your watch because you just tap it and start   |
| 07:18      | talking and you're off to the races and it synchronises whatever you say back to the                   |
| 07:24      | application on your phone.                                                                             |
| 07:26      | And I would add to that that this is the reason why [[Drafts]] is one of the very few applications         |
| 07:31      | that I badge and I've enabled [[Drafts]] to badge me if there's anything in the inbox because              |
| 07:37      | I'm always dictating stuff into [[Drafts]] on my watch and then I forget about it.                         |
| 07:41      | So then I see that badge on my home screen and it makes me crazy because I hate badges,                |
| 07:46      | right?                                                                                                 |
| 07:47      | And the badge just represents anything in the inbox that hasn't been processed.                        |
| 07:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:52      | So I love the Apple Watch functionality and the fact that you can have it tag automatically.           |
| 07:57      | Everything that comes from the Apple Watch is so useful because then as you say to him,                |
| 08:01      | it doesn't always understand what you say quite right.                                                 |
| 08:03      | And this is on Apple's dictation.                                                                      |
| 08:06      | I should point out, agile tortures hasn't written their own dictation engine.                          |
| 08:10      | They use the built-in dictation engine.                                                                |
| 08:13      | So that means all of your data is nice and secure and safe as well.                                    |
| 08:16      | And I like to tag everything that comes from the Apple Watch because then when I'm looking             |
| 08:19      | at it and I'm like, what did I mean, six "catala"?                                                       |
| 08:22      | What?                                                                                                  |
| 08:23      | What is that?                                                                                          |
| 08:24      | Oh, right.                                                                                             |
| 08:25      | Six bars of chocolate.                                                                                 |
| 08:26      | That's what I wanted to remember.                                                                      |
| 08:29      | Then I can figure it out and I make sure to get my chocolate consumption right.                        |
| 08:32      | My only question was if it's six, why isn't it 10, honestly?                                           |
| 08:37      | I think it was a specific recipe that I was actually making sure I had the ingredients                 |
| 08:42      | for because I had the recipe on my iPad and I was going through the stuff in the kitchen               |
| 08:47      | and it was much easier to just talk to my Apple Watch.                                                 |
| 08:50      | I believe I was making chocolate brownies.                                                             |
| 08:52      | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 08:53      | See, I thought it was 10 is six and six is none.                                                       |
| 08:57      | I thought it was something that nature.                                                                |
| 08:59      | Well, that could work too.                                                                             |
| 09:00      | I always need more chocolate.                                                                          |
| 09:03      | Actually, you know, groceries is actually one of the things for me is, you know, given                 |
| 09:08      | the life that I'm living now and some changes that I've made, I actually use [[Drafts]] specifically       |
| 09:16      | for a grocery list.                                                                                    |
| 09:18      | And what I will do is I will put it on dictation and I will read off various different things          |
| 09:24      | that I know I need to get.                                                                             |
| 09:25      | I will literally open my fridge, have the phone on the counter, you know, or paired to my              |
| 09:31      | AirPods or whatever, and I will start a dictated draft and I will say eggs, new line, milk,            |
| 09:37      | new line, bread, new line, and I will just keep going until I'm done.                                  |
| 09:43      | And with the way the capture engine is on the iPhone, you can keep going forever.                      |
| 09:49      | I've dictated entire posts that I've had to go in and modify just because of the dictation,            |
| 09:54      | but I've gone in and created entire posts on my way home from work, and I've just had                  |
| 09:59      | the phone in my passenger seat and I've dictated the entire thing.                                     |
| 10:03      | And it's really amazing once you start getting into that mentality of being able to use it             |
| 10:10      | for long capture as well as, you know, a short, simple thing.                                          |
| 10:14      | But once I have the grocery list, I have a single action, it's just called add to groceries            |
| 10:20      | and it's a built-in action for a list to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                    |
| 10:25      | And I tap that, it's added to my grocery list and I'm done.                                            |
| 10:29      | That is genius.                                                                                        |
| 10:30      | Yeah, I know we have some listeners at Apple and I'd ask the listeners at Apple right                  |
| 10:34      | now to just think pleasant thoughts for a moment and tune out because one of the things                |
| 10:39      | [[Drafts]] does, I'm not sure if this is even allowed, but he manages to loop dictation                    |
| 10:46      | in a way because usually there's a dictation timer on the iPhone and iPad where after about            |
| 10:51      | a minute, one time I timed it was 45 seconds, but I think they've increased it a bit.                  |
| 10:55      | But after a certain amount of time, it just stops and [[Drafts]] continues to run.                         |
| 11:02      | It's, you know, there's no timer on that dictation, which is what allows Tim to do that.               |
| 11:06      | Yeah, there's a little magic there.                                                                    |
| 11:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 11:10      | I don't even know what's involved.                                                                     |
| 11:11      | I don't want to know and I don't want to talk about a lot, if you know what I mean,                    |
| 11:14      | you know.                                                                                              |
| 11:15      | Yeah, I know what you mean.                                                                            |
| 11:16      | I don't want it to go away either.                                                                     |
| 11:18      | But there is some hiccups with it too.                                                                 |
| 11:21      | Sometimes I find capitalisation problems when it kind of resets itself.                                |
| 11:27      | If you're in the middle of a sentence, it may suddenly have an additional capital letter               |
| 11:31      | or something like that.                                                                                |
| 11:32      | But so you've got to go back and tune it up a little bit, but you're right.                            |
| 11:36      | And the ability just to push a button and just start talking is a great feature.                       |
| 11:42      | And one of the reasons why [[Drafts]] as well as in my doc.                                                |
| 11:45      | Well, and with the text modification and going in there and capitalising words and making              |
| 11:51      | them lowercase, with the power of the automation in [[Drafts]], you can do that.                           |
| 11:56      | And it's very simple.                                                                                  |
| 11:57      | It's a simple action.                                                                                  |
| 11:58      | You can highlight the text.                                                                            |
| 11:59      | You can select it and it's done.                                                                       |
| 12:02      | And that's the whole beauty of this too, is it's just so easy to manipulate text with                  |
| 12:06      | in the document.                                                                                       |
| 12:07      | I was going to say, for anybody listening who's there going, wait, I have to say new                   |
| 12:10      | line after every item.                                                                                 |
| 12:12      | That's really annoying.                                                                                |
| 12:13      | Have you tried talking to one of the ladies in a can recently, adding stuff to your shopping           |
| 12:17      | list?                                                                                                  |
| 12:18      | I literally have to go, Amazon lady, please add toilet paper to the shopping list.                     |
| 12:22      | Amazon lady, please add ketchup to the shopping list.                                                  |
| 12:25      | Amazon lady, please add XYZ to the shopping list.                                                      |
| 12:28      | And you're there going in so many more words.                                                          |
| 12:30      | I'd rather just say the words new line.                                                                |
| 12:31      | So I'm stealing your action there, Tim.                                                                |
| 12:34      | You've changed my life.                                                                                |
| 12:35      | Well, maybe, hopefully for the better.                                                                 |
| 12:39      | We'll see.                                                                                             |
| 12:40      | Oh, definitely.                                                                                        |
| 12:41      | And, you know, we're not trying to turn this show into a [[Drafts]] commercial, but the fact               |
| 12:45      | is the three of us love it.                                                                            |
| 12:46      | And this is one of those apps where you've got a single developer behind it who's super                |
| 12:51      | passionate about making it and just solves all those problems for you.                                 |
| 12:56      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 12:57      | And one of the things that I actually think is really good with the release of [[Drafts]]                  |
| 13:01      | five, and I think it's something where a lot of people, you know, because it was a                     |
| 13:04      | switch over to subscription.                                                                           |
| 13:06      | And I think a lot of people were very turned off by that.                                              |
| 13:09      | A lot of people don't like subscription applications.                                                  |
| 13:12      | But the one thing that's really amazing with [[Drafts]] five is that it's completely free to               |
| 13:16      | download and try.                                                                                      |
| 13:18      | There's actions already preinstalled.                                                                  |
| 13:20      | You can download actions from the action directory and you can use it for free to see how it's         |
| 13:25      | going to fit in your life.                                                                             |
| 13:27      | And then when you want to get into the customisation, once you see how great this application is,      |
| 13:33      | then you can do that.                                                                                  |
| 13:34      | And so you can actually use it for free just to capture text and send it to different places           |
| 13:39      | using this share sheet, right?                                                                         |
| 13:41      | That's all you really need.                                                                            |
| 13:42      | So getting started with it is easier than ever.                                                        |
| 13:46      | And then getting into the weeds and getting into automation and all the different things               |
| 13:50      | that we do with it, yeah, that's the subscription portion of it.                                       |
| 13:54      | But nobody should be put off at this point to download it and try it.                                  |
| 14:00      | Well, I think it goes beyond try.                                                                      |
| 14:02      | Let's say it's an optional subscription, really, because the power user features, a lot of             |
| 14:07      | the stuff we're going to talk about today is in the subscription.                                      |
| 14:10      | But the basics, the stuff I was talking about that I did in that hotel lobby comes for free            |
| 14:16      | and it's not going away.                                                                               |
| 14:17      | I mean, you can use that for an unlimited time with those basic features.                              |
| 14:22      | So it's a good model, I think.                                                                         |
| 14:25      | And I love that the developer is passionate about it.                                                  |
| 14:28      | When you have somebody that is like that, they figure out how to turn carriage returns                 |
| 14:33      | into new entries and reminders for your grocery list.                                                  |
| 14:35      | They figure out how to make dictation run longer than a set period of time.                            |
| 14:41      | And all that stuff goes into that app.                                                                 |
| 14:43      | And now that it is on a subscription, the guy can pay for his shoes.                                   |
| 14:48      | He's making enough money that he can actually put even more wood behind the arrow.                     |
| 14:54      | And we get things like [[Drafts]] for Mac, which is now out.                                               |
| 14:58      | And I'll put a link in the show notes.                                                                 |
| 14:59      | I did the screencast for them when they released it.                                                   |
| 15:03      | And it's really great.                                                                                 |
| 15:04      | I mean, it's not as powerful as an iOS yet, but just having that stuff you dictate on                  |
| 15:10      | your watch show up on your Mac is pretty handy.                                                        |
| 15:13      | I think with the Mac version of the app, which Rose did the review on for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), which           |
| 15:22      | is great.                                                                                              |
| 15:23      | Thank you.                                                                                             |
| 15:24      | And I think the one thing there that, and I put a little post together kind of linking                 |
| 15:29      | to the article, it's a 1.0 application and it's on a whole new platform.                               |
| 15:35      | So having the actions come eventually will be there.                                                   |
| 15:39      | And I think it's just a matter of time, right?                                                         |
| 15:41      | He's got some other pressing stuff I think on iOS that he wants to do and bring that                   |
| 15:45      | over to the Mac as well.                                                                               |
| 15:47      | But it'll be there.                                                                                    |
| 15:48      | It'll come and we'll have some parity there.                                                           |
| 15:51      | The actions might work a little differently at some point, but just having the ability                 |
| 15:55      | to access everything on a Mac, I think is actually going to turn a lot of users on to                  |
| 15:59      | using [[Drafts]], whereas before they might have wanted to use other applications because they             |
| 16:05      | couldn't access the [[Drafts]] on a Mac.                                                                   |
| 16:07      | And now they have the ability to do so.                                                                |
| 16:09      | And I think that's going to be really good going forward.                                              |
| 16:12      | And my power tip on that is enable the keyboard shortcut and the menu bar app if you put it            |
| 16:18      | on your Mac because if someone, like you're sitting in your front of your Mac and a thought            |
| 16:23      | occurs to you, a phone call comes in, something that you want to write notes down on, you're           |
| 16:27      | one keystroke away from the [[Drafts]] inbox.                                                              |
| 16:30      | It's just like back on the iOS devices where you tap the icon and you can start typing.                |
| 16:35      | They essentially do the same thing on the Mac.                                                         |
| 16:37      | And you can always put it somewhere else later.                                                        |
| 16:39      | You can email it.                                                                                      |
| 16:40      | You can put in your listings to whatever floats your boat.                                             |
| 16:44      | But just getting to text input so quickly is golden.                                                   |
| 16:51      | So I just want, we're going to get into some of Tim's automations.                                     |
| 16:56      | He's got some simple ones and some more complicated ones.                                              |
| 16:59      | So hopefully we've got something for everybody.                                                        |
| 17:01      | But before we do that, I just kind of wanted to give an overview.                                      |
| 17:04      | We've been gushing about the app, but I just wanted to talk kind of more practical terms               |
| 17:08      | about the way it works.                                                                                |
| 17:10      | I kind of call it the three layers of [[Drafts]], you know, the first is the basics, the one               |
| 17:16      | that came out with those first versions of the application and the idea is quick text                  |
| 17:20      | capture and quick process.                                                                             |
| 17:22      | So they have these actions built in where you can just type something and then send                    |
| 17:26      | it off as a text message or send it as an email or save it to an application.                          |
| 17:31      | The second layer is what I would call probably actions.                                                |
| 17:35      | And those kind of came with version four.                                                              |
| 17:37      | How would you summarise those, Tim?                                                                    |
| 17:39      | Oh, yeah, I think with version four, there were a lot more built in actions.                           |
| 17:44      | I think originally when [[Drafts]] was first created, I remember the story, I can't remember where         |
| 17:49      | I heard it, but I know Greg said it, that he was trying to send an email to his wife                   |
| 17:54      | and then he's like, ah, this would be better as a text message.                                        |
| 17:57      | And back then on the iPhone, you couldn't copy paste, right?                                           |
| 18:00      | This was the first iPhone.                                                                             |
| 18:02      | And so those simple actions to send to messages and emails were great.                                 |
| 18:08      | And then it kind of expanded with a little bit more built in functionality and doing                   |
| 18:12      | things with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] because it's a framework as well as an app.                                      |
| 18:18      | You can do that email and just kind of progressively growing from there.                               |
| 18:23      | Yeah, I would consider those more action based, right?                                                 |
| 18:27      | And there's more complex actions as you go.                                                            |
| 18:30      | And there's really nice ways to take bits of your draft and manipulate it in ways to                   |
| 18:36      | make some of those actions work.                                                                       |
| 18:38      | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 18:39      | And by the way, the episode where Greg talked about this, he definitely talked about it                |
| 18:43      | on episode 33 of Vector, which I have got a link to in the show notes.                                 |
| 18:48      | And then the action's got increasingly complex, but totally usable.                                    |
| 18:53      | And you don't need to understand programming to do this.                                               |
| 18:56      | You can automate [[Drafts]] right out of the box very easily.                                              |
| 18:59      | And then with the more recent versions, suddenly you've got keyboard customisation, you've             |
| 19:05      | got scripting.                                                                                         |
| 19:07      | It's like come to a whole new level.                                                                   |
| 19:09      | It's almost like a programming environment if you want it to be.                                       |
| 19:13      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 19:14      | And with the actions, the one thing that you can do and even the scripts as well, you can              |
| 19:18      | start combining them, right?                                                                           |
| 19:20      | So like one of the biggest actions that I have in [[Drafts]] is clipboard, right?                          |
| 19:26      | And there's an action step and you can make that into multiple different things that you               |
| 19:32      | want.                                                                                                  |
| 19:33      | And it's really powerful just to manipulate text in various different ways using a simple              |
| 19:38      | built-in template.                                                                                     |
| 19:40      | And it's easily modifiable.                                                                            |
| 19:42      | It's very understandable.                                                                              |
| 19:43      | And you can go in there, do that, and you can just copy some clipboard text and either                 |
| 19:47      | share it with another app or send it as a message or just copy it so you can jump into                 |
| 19:52      | an app in a more traditional copy-paste way.                                                           |
| 19:57      | There's little tiny actions like that that are built in that are really helpful.                       |
| 20:04      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by TextExpander from our friends at Smile.                |

| 20:23      | And the brand new TextExpander 6.5 is now available for macOS, as well as TextExpander                 |
| 20:28      | 2.0 being available on Windows.                                                                        |
| 20:32      | Both new versions of TextExpander are supporting a new visual editor for snippets.                     |
| 20:36      | This editor makes it easier to see and edit snippet fill-ins, dates, date math, nested                 |
| 20:41      | snippets, and more.                                                                                    |

| 20:52      | If, like me, you're always looking for ways to be a little more productive, you need TextExpander.     |
| 20:57      | It makes typing those repetitive phrases and paragraphs unbelievably fast.                             |
| 21:02      | Seriously, an entire paragraph would take ages to type.                                                |
| 21:06      | But you can expand it in a second, which leaves you more time to do what you do best.                  |
| 21:11      | I personally love TextExpander.                                                                        |
| 21:13      | It saves me time every day, on average 15 minutes.                                                     |
| 21:17      | You might think 15 minutes a day doesn't sound like much, but 5 days a week at work,                   |
| 21:21      | that adds up to a lot.                                                                                 |

| 21:29      | Our thanks to TextExpander from SMILE for their support of this show and Relay FM.                     |
| 21:35      | You know, Rose, one of the things I like about TextExpander, and we're no longer doing the             |
| 21:39      | ad, but this is editorial, is TextExpander works at [[Drafts]], and [[Drafts]] works with TextExpander,        |
| 21:46      | and it's one of the reasons why I like to use [[Drafts]] for text input, because I get                     |
| 21:50      | all my snippets.                                                                                       |
| 21:51      | Yeah, it is really good, and it's got proper support as well, so you can at any point go               |
| 21:56      | into the settings and just update them.                                                                |
| 21:58      | I love that so much.                                                                                   |
| 21:59      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 22:00      | So, Tim, give us the goods.                                                                            |
| 22:02      | We want some of your favourite [[Drafts]] workflows.                                                        |
| 22:06      | So things that I use on a regular basis, just for simple things, I've already said about               |
| 22:13      | the groceries edition, one of the things I do constantly is manipulate text.                           |
| 22:21      | And I have an action that I created, and what it is is actually from [[Drafts]] for, there are             |
| 22:25      | a bunch of different little actions that I could grab, and I changed it all around.                    |
| 22:30      | And now what I can do is take any text, select it, and then I tap the action, or I have a              |
| 22:37      | keyboard shortcut, and what it does is it kicks it off.                                                |
| 22:41      | It gives me a list of the things that I want to do.                                                    |
| 22:44      | So I can choose to title case everything, lower case everything, upper case everything.                |
| 22:50      | I can encircle it, I can strike through, I can do all these different text manipulations,              |
| 22:55      | and I can do that with a bit of text, I can do that with the entire document, whatever                 |
| 22:59      | I want.                                                                                                |
| 23:01      | And that's just one little thing that it's a very complicated script, but it's all done                |
| 23:05      | for you.                                                                                               |
| 23:06      | It's already taken care of, but it's something that you can easily install, easily add to              |
| 23:10      | your workflow to fix all the little typos that you may have.                                           |
| 23:15      | Very very handy action for me.                                                                         |
| 23:17      | And I'm using that literally every day, and I'm probably three, four, five times in an                 |
| 23:22      | hour if I'm being honest.                                                                              |
| 23:24      | I'm in [[Drafts]] constantly throughout the day, so that's one big thing I use.                            |
| 23:29      | I journal all the time.                                                                                |
| 23:31      | And so for people listening, we're going to put a link in the show notes, and Tim has                  |
| 23:36      | created an action directory, and these are shareable, and the [[Drafts]], Greg and the gang                |
| 23:42      | at [[Drafts]] has made Tim's [[Drafts]] action directory shareable that gives you action keys associated       |
| 23:50      | with text transformations.                                                                             |
| 23:52      | So all you have to do is open that link on your iPhone or iPad that has [[Drafts]] installed,              |
| 23:58      | and press the install button, and you're going to get the benefit of all this stuff.                   |
| 24:01      | And it is crazy.                                                                                       |
| 24:02      | I was just looking through it, Outdent, Update Tags, all of the markdown stuff, Smart Parentheses,     |
| 24:09      | Smart Quotes, Smart Brackets, you got it all covered here.                                             |
| 24:13      | Yeah, and in that key action group, I've done two things, and this is, here's a little                 |
| 24:18      | pro tip that I did for the review.                                                                     |
| 24:21      | One of the things that I missed from version four that you could do is you could have an               |
| 24:24      | action in multiple places.                                                                             |
| 24:26      | So what I did was I created a duplicate action, and it's all kind of at the bottom.                    |
| 24:31      | So for every action that's at the top, there's an action at the bottom that's a duplicate,             |
| 24:35      | and you can copy that over.                                                                            |
| 24:36      | And what those duplicate actions are, it just has one action step, and it's include action.            |
| 24:42      | And that action step is really powerful because I can take any other action that I have and            |
| 24:47      | it just include that as part of an action.                                                             |
| 24:51      | So when I have that in other areas, now I can only edit it in one place, but I get the                 |
| 24:57      | benefit of it updating everywhere.                                                                     |
| 25:00      | And so when you download it, it'll make a little bit more sense when you download it.                  |
| 25:04      | But it's something that I can now have one action and use it everywhere, which I really                |
| 25:11      | like the principle of.                                                                                 |
| 25:13      | But it took me a while to compile this thing for the review, but I wanted people to understand         |
| 25:18      | that you can have all of these little actions at your fingertips, and these are all the ones           |
| 25:22      | that I have keyboard shortcuts for.                                                                    |
| 25:25      | So every single one of these has an assigned keyboard shortcut for me.                                 |
| 25:28      | So I imagine you use this often with your iPad.                                                        |
| 25:30      | Oh, yes, all the time.                                                                                 |
| 25:32      | My iPhone gets mainly capture use, but if I'm manipulating, writing, journalling, anything,             |
| 25:39      | it's 99% of the time it's on my iPad.                                                                  |
| 25:43      | So how did you go about building this?                                                                 |
| 25:45      | So for a lot of the things in that key action group, I actually use some of the [[Drafts]] for             |
| 25:52      | actions and carried them over.                                                                         |
| 25:55      | A lot of them have different scripts associated with them.                                             |
| 25:58      | Some of them don't.                                                                                    |
| 26:00      | It just depends on the action.                                                                         |
| 26:02      | But I kind of started building everything based off of what I had in [[Drafts]] for.                       |
| 26:06      | There was a nice way to migrate from [[Drafts]] for into [[Drafts]] five.                                      |
| 26:10      | So that's what I did during the beta.                                                                  |
| 26:13      | And then I just started assembling from there and started refining it based on my limited              |
| 26:18      | programming skills.                                                                                    |
| 26:19      | So some of the some of the things in there are probably outdated as far as scripting goes.             |
| 26:24      | But a lot of them are still relevant.                                                                  |
| 26:27      | They still work.                                                                                       |
| 26:28      | They're fast.                                                                                          |
| 26:29      | There's no problems with what's there.                                                                 |
| 26:31      | So it just, it took, I just took some time and thought of all the major actions that                   |
| 26:36      | people would use to manipulate either text or a line or whatever and just put that into                |
| 26:42      | one key set so that people could kind of reap that benefit of installing something that                |
| 26:49      | would really change the way they would be able to use [[Drafts]].                                          |
| 26:52      | Well, if I sound distracted, it's because I'm installing it right now.                                 |
| 26:59      | I just wanted to go back to the thing that you were saying about the include action step.              |
| 27:04      | Because I think this is something that maybe a lot of people haven't thought about.                    |
| 27:09      | But especially for me, I have several actions which are included in multiple action groups.            |
| 27:15      | So that means that instead of copying that, I just use, I have one, I, in my case, I have              |
| 27:21      | an action group called master actions.                                                                 |
| 27:24      | And I just use the include action everywhere and it is so useful just because then, as                 |
| 27:29      | you said, you update once and it's updated everywhere, which is great, you know, if,                   |
| 27:34      | for example, you figure out, hey, as well as doing X, Y, Z and air table, I can also do                |
| 27:39      | ABC.                                                                                                   |
| 27:40      | Well, I just need to add that in my draft section that talks to air table and then voila.              |
| 27:45      | And then you do it once and it's all done, which is very, very useful.                                 |
| 27:50      | And with that action group that I created, one of the things that I did was I wanted                   |
| 27:55      | to have a visual way just for me to look at what was there to be a duplicate action and                |
| 28:01      | what was there to be the original action.                                                              |
| 28:03      | So what I actually ended up doing was finding a character in another app and just saying,              |
| 28:08      | all right, it's a small enough symbol that's not a big deal.                                           |
| 28:11      | It's not something I will commonly use ever.                                                           |
| 28:14      | And I put that in the front of the action.                                                             |
| 28:16      | So now when I use the search up at the top, if I think of, oh, hey, you know what, this                |
| 28:21      | action needs to be updated, I can go find the action.                                                  |
| 28:25      | I can just simply type text modifier and then I can pull that up, but I know which one the             |
| 28:31      | original action is.                                                                                    |
| 28:33      | And once I update it in that one spot, it carries through.                                             |
| 28:36      | And so for me, having that little symbol there was an epiphany at the time for me to say,              |
| 28:44      | this is how I'm going to manage everything going forward.                                              |
| 28:46      | It's a little cumbersome at the start, but it's by practice is really easy.                            |
| 28:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 28:52      | That makes perfect sense.                                                                              |
| 28:53      | And I think it's one of these things.                                                                  |
| 28:55      | You may be there going, okay, I've never used [[Drafts]] before, but you don't need to worry               |
| 28:58      | about having master actions and copies of actions and everything right now.                            |
| 29:03      | But when you come back to this in three months after you've become addicted to the application,        |
| 29:07      | you're going to go, now I get what Tim's talking about, because this is so useful for those            |
| 29:11      | of us who have got that little bit farther down the path and were already enslaved to                  |
| 29:16      | those [[Drafts]], as you might say.                                                                        |
| 29:19      | And one of the things that's really important, I think there's multiple action groups that             |
| 29:23      | you can create.                                                                                        |
| 29:25      | And I think you can move actions around and there's a way to do that.                                  |
| 29:28      | And there's some tips on the [[Drafts]] website to do that.                                                |
| 29:32      | So I don't want to go through it here because it's got some visuals.                                   |
| 29:35      | But starting with as few actions as possible when you're actually getting started with                 |
| 29:40      | [[Drafts]] is probably the best way to do it.                                                              |
| 29:42      | Some very simple actions, built-in actions, that's probably the best way to start.                     |
| 29:49      | And then over time, you can start adding different action groups and there's nothing to prevent        |
| 29:54      | you from installing a bunch and having those action groups.                                            |
| 29:58      | And you can kind of just go take a peek, see how it might fit later on.                                |
| 30:02      | But you start with something small and the basics.                                                     |
| 30:05      | I think one of the videos I did for Greg, I shared my, what is in essence my earthquake                |
| 30:10      | action, because I live in Southern California, occasionally we have a shaker here and the              |
| 30:15      | phones always go down afterwards because they're risk calling each other to say they're okay.          |
| 30:21      | So the trick is to get a message out as soon as possible.                                              |
| 30:24      | So I have a draft that says, I'm okay, I'm located at dot, dot, dot.                                   |
| 30:29      | And it's already programmed to send to my wife and my two daughters and my sister.                     |
| 30:34      | So if there's an earthquake, I open [[Drafts]], I just make sure I've got the right location               |
| 30:39      | in there and send and that message always gets out.                                                    |
| 30:43      | You can modify that action and I can help you with that later.                                         |
| 30:48      | But you can modify that action.                                                                        |
| 30:49      | You don't even need a draft to be created.                                                             |
| 30:51      | You can just have it be the location of where you are right now.                                       |
| 30:56      | And you can send that in the background and you don't need to do any other work.                       |
| 31:00      | Kind of almost like shortcuts.                                                                         |
| 31:01      | I know that's in there now, but the thing for me is it's not necessarily a map location.               |
| 31:07      | It may be at Jim's house or something like that.                                                       |
| 31:11      | Oh, okay.                                                                                              |
| 31:12      | And it just...                                                                                         |
| 31:13      | Because I played with that and I had it working, but I was like, yeah, I can take a second             |
| 31:19      | to write where I'm at.                                                                                 |
| 31:21      | And frankly, that way I know the data's right.                                                         |
| 31:25      | Sometimes geolocation isn't always perfect and I don't really want to send them a pin.                 |
| 31:29      | I just want to tell them, there's only a few places I am, I don't get around as much.                  |
| 31:35      | Maybe Disneyland.                                                                                      |
| 31:36      | But you should have one that just says Disneyland and then that'd be great.                            |
| 31:39      | I'm at Disneyland.                                                                                     |
| 31:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 31:41      | I'm very jealous of that.                                                                              |
| 31:42      | I was just thinking, what you could do is you could have an action that's got a prompt                 |
| 31:45      | and it's got a couple of buttons.                                                                      |
| 31:46      | So it's got Disneyland and a couple of other places that you usually are like home or Starbucks        |
| 31:52      | or electric bike.                                                                                      |
| 31:54      | And then it's got a text box and if you hit one of those, it will just send it.                        |
| 31:58      | If you hit one of the original buttons and otherwise if you fill out the text box and                  |
| 32:01      | then press okay, it takes whatever's in the text box.                                                  |
| 32:04      | That would be a smart way of announcing perhaps.                                                       |
| 32:08      | But the point is for getting started, it's a very simple message that's pre-populated                  |
| 32:14      | and also the recipients are pre-populated.                                                             |
| 32:16      | So I don't have to spend any time goofing around if something goes down.                               |
| 32:21      | I can get the message out very quickly.                                                                |
| 32:24      | And that's a very simple, that almost goes back to [[Drafts]] 101, but it works.                           |
| 32:29      | And now with this new set of tools I've got, I could title case it, I could do anything                |
| 32:34      | I want with this message.                                                                              |
| 32:35      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 32:36      | And I think that's the big thing.                                                                      |
| 32:38      | [[Drafts]] can be super powerful.                                                                          |
| 32:41      | It is probably for me one of the most powerful apps I've ever used.                                    |
| 32:46      | But for me, the simple actions are what I use on a daily basis.                                        |
| 32:52      | I'm not doing complex actions day in and day out.                                                      |
| 32:56      | I'm using a lot of simple ones.                                                                        |
| 32:58      | And it just makes life easier and anything that makes my life easier, I'm all on board                 |
| 33:03      | with.                                                                                                  |
| 33:04      | And that's what I was talking about, the multiple layers of [[Drafts]] earlier, because even though        |
| 33:07      | you can script in it, I can tell you I have one draft action I've built with a script.                 |
| 33:15      | Almost everything I do is like, get this into OmniFocus, get it to you Lizzie, send this               |
| 33:19      | as an email.                                                                                           |
| 33:20      | I mean, even just the idea of, for people who are concerned about distractions of your                 |
| 33:25      | email inbox, you go in your email to send an email, but you see something in the inbox                 |
| 33:30      | and off you go.                                                                                        |
| 33:32      | With [[Drafts]], you can just write the email and [[Drafts]] and send it without ever going                    |
| 33:36      | really into your mail application.                                                                     |
| 33:39      | And all of these things are real basic, but totally useful.                                            |
| 33:44      | And even more important than email, Twitter, right?                                                    |
| 33:47      | You can tweet from [[Drafts]] and you never have to open Twitter at all.                                   |
| 33:51      | So right now, as we're kind of recording here, there's some big movies coming, right?                  |
| 33:57      | You got Avengers Endgame, you got Star Wars coming up.                                                 |
| 34:01      | If there's any spoiler stuff that you want to stay away from, you could stay off of Twitter.           |
| 34:05      | You can still tweet and send out whatever you want to, but you don't have to open Twitter              |
| 34:11      | at all.                                                                                                |
| 34:12      | And you can do a tweet, you can do a tweet storm and all of those are available on the                 |
| 34:16      | Action Directory and you can just install them and you're done.                                        |
| 34:19      | So it's something that for me, I'm not necessarily distracted by going to multiple different apps.     |
| 34:26      | I can be in one app and have it be multiple things.                                                    |
| 34:29      | When I talked about that in my review, is this being such a modular interface that you can             |
| 34:34      | make for yourself and have it be multiple things for you if that's what you want?                      |
| 34:40      | It may be something, a simple text capture app at the start.                                           |
| 34:43      | And then as you progress, this may replace multiple apps for you.                                      |
| 34:47      | For me, definitely the workspaces and the action groups and the fact that you can combine              |
| 34:51      | them together is basically made [[Drafts]] into about 10 different applications for me because             |
| 34:57      | it is so flexible.                                                                                     |
| 34:59      | And that is something that, for some people, that might not work at all, but for me, having            |
| 35:05      | the list of my [[Drafts]] switched and the actions that are available to me on the right-hand              |
| 35:09      | side, just having that switch when I tap one button, it's like, okay, great.                           |
| 35:13      | Well, now I'm in blogging mode because I'm in my blogging application, which is [[Drafts]]                 |
| 35:16      | or switch.                                                                                             |
| 35:17      | And then I'm in a writing mode for something else, like super secret project number one.               |
| 35:23      | And I switched to that and it's, okay, super secret project time.                                      |
| 35:26      | Let's get writing.                                                                                     |
| 35:27      | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 35:28      | It's good fun.                                                                                         |
| 35:29      | We'll definitely go down gang and download the key action group that Tim has created.                  |
| 35:36      | But we're not happy, Tim.                                                                              |
| 35:37      | We want more automation out of you.                                                                    |
| 35:40      | We want all the automation.                                                                            |
| 35:42      | So some of the other things that I do, and I do a lot with task management in [[Drafts]]                   |
| 35:49      | and on iOS specifically, I'm not so much a Mac user.                                                   |
| 35:55      | But I use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                                                                   |
| 35:57      | That's what I've been using now for a little while.                                                    |
| 35:59      | I've moonlighted with other apps with [[Things]] with [[OmniFocus]], with [[Todoist]], all these different         |
| 36:05      | apps.                                                                                                  |
| 36:06      | And for whatever reason, I'm just, I'm always drawn back to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] because of the ways              |
| 36:10      | I can capture.                                                                                         |
| 36:12      | And so for me, getting any sort of task down, I can do it through complex automation.                  |
| 36:22      | But sometimes I just need something simple.                                                            |
| 36:24      | I just need a text box to pop up, capture what I need to put a date and time to it and                 |
| 36:30      | send it on its way.                                                                                    |
| 36:31      | And I don't want a lot of friction.                                                                    |
| 36:33      | So one of the things that I created, and I actually just created this the other day,                   |
| 36:37      | and I've done this for other apps too, but I'm using [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] here for an example, is                 |
| 36:42      | just an add single [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] action.                                                                   |
| 36:45      | And what this does is I can pop up a little prompt.                                                    |
| 36:49      | And what that prompt does is it just says, hey, I need a title for this task.                          |
| 36:56      | That's all I need.                                                                                     |
| 36:57      | Select a due date and time.                                                                            |
| 37:00      | And if you want me to add an alarm to this, I can do that too, right?                                  |
| 37:04      | So that'll pop up your notification because you can't not, you can have a task that has                |
| 37:11      | a due date, but no notification kicks off.                                                             |
| 37:16      | It'll put it in the inbox for me and then it goes on its merry way.                                    |
| 37:23      | So it pops up this prompt.                                                                             |
| 37:25      | And what the beauty behind this action for me is I don't have to enter in an actual draft.             |
| 37:33      | So for example, I run a meeting every week for about 200 people.                                       |
| 37:38      | It's a giant call-in meeting for work.                                                                 |
| 37:42      | And sometimes I'll be sitting there listening to something and I'll have a thought, enter              |
| 37:46      | in my head, and I'll be like, ooh, I need to remember that.                                            |
| 37:50      | And I'll kick off this action because I'm taking notes on the meeting in [[Drafts]] on my                  |
| 37:54      | iPad.                                                                                                  |
| 37:55      | I'll kick open this action, the prompt will come up, I'll enter in the task title, I'll                |
| 38:00      | select a date and time, and I'll hit send, and then it's gone.                                         |
| 38:04      | And I don't have to jump over to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] or good tasks, which is what I use.                         |
| 38:09      | I don't have to jump over to another app.                                                              |
| 38:11      | I don't have to stop taking meeting notes and enter a new draft.                                       |
| 38:15      | It's using all of the prompt information.                                                              |
| 38:18      | So there's no draft required.                                                                          |
| 38:20      | And this is kind of like a medium automation for me to say, hey, I can use the data that               |
| 38:28      | I get from this prompt step in a bunch of different ways and I don't need to create                    |
| 38:35      | cruft in my inbox, let's say.                                                                          |
| 38:37      | So I know David, you said, hey, when I have the notification badges for my inbox, I don't              |
| 38:43      | like seeing that and you want to clear things.                                                         |
| 38:45      | This makes it so that I can not only add it, but I'm also not adding to the mental burden              |
| 38:50      | of my inbox.                                                                                           |
| 38:51      | So you're in essence adding a user interface element to [[Drafts]] to skip the inbox?                      |
| 38:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 38:59      | So it just takes whatever's in that prompt step and sends it on its way.                               |
| 39:03      | And that's all you have to do.                                                                         |
| 39:05      | And because it does nothing to your current draft, it's almost like you're popping into                |
| 39:09      | another application briefly, but you're not because you just trigger a keyboard shortcut,              |
| 39:13      | I'm guessing, and then you've got a new reminder and you can keep taking notes.                        |
| 39:18      | I find that that happens to me a lot in meetings.                                                      |
| 39:21      | I'm there and I'm writing something down and there's something else that occurs to me.                 |
| 39:25      | And I'm trying to figure that out.                                                                     |
| 39:26      | So I'm going to have to have a look into this because this is definitely something that                |
| 39:30      | I can use because I take so many notes and [[Drafts]] for almost everything.                               |
| 39:34      | I've done this before.                                                                                 |
| 39:35      | I did this with things at one point in time, but the one thing about things that I didn't              |
| 39:40      | like was that it uses [[URL Schemes]].                                                                     |
| 39:42      | And because this uses the scripting and it uses the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] framework, I don't have                  |
| 39:49      | to leave the app.                                                                                      |
| 39:50      | So with things, I would be kicked out of the app and then brought back in and ready to                 |
| 39:54      | go again to type.                                                                                      |
| 39:56      | But now I don't even have that round trip.                                                             |
| 39:58      | It just says, all right, it's captured, you're done, and I don't have to go anywhere.                  |
| 40:02      | So I really can stay focused on what I'm doing.                                                        |
| 40:06      | And for OmniFocus users, you can use this as well because OmniFocus, and I'm sure many                 |
| 40:10      | other task management applications can capture from a specific [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list, which means             |
| 40:15      | that you can say add it to an OmniFocus list in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and OmniFocus can eat everything             |
| 40:19      | that's in that list for you, meaning that it gets into whatever your task manager is.                  |
| 40:23      | I know Jew does the same thing.                                                                        |
| 40:26      | And I'm sure there's many others that do that as well.                                                 |
| 40:28      | That is genius.                                                                                        |
| 40:31      | And it's just something that, it makes my life a little easier and it makes it so that                 |
| 40:36      | I don't have to worry about remembering that, oh, there's another draft there.                         |
| 40:42      | I'm always trying to make things a little bit more efficient for myself.                               |
| 40:46      | And having this there is just like, oh, hey, I can add a reminder.                                     |
| 40:49      | From at any point in time, I can add this.                                                             |
| 40:51      | And it just makes life so much easier.                                                                 |
| 40:53      | Well, it saves you processing it twice, right?                                                         |
| 40:56      | That's what this is all about.                                                                         |
| 40:58      | Add it once, not more than you have to.                                                                |
| 41:01      | Absolutely.                                                                                            |

| 41:17      | If you have a Mac and an iPad, you should be checking out Luna Display.                                |
| 41:22      | This little piece of hardware gives you a second display that's super portable with                    |

| 41:30      | So how does it work?                                                                                   |
| 41:31      | You get the Luna Display hardware, you plug it into the back of your Mac, and then your                |
| 41:36      | iPad becomes a secondary display for your Mac.                                                         |
| 41:39      | It's that easy.                                                                                        |
| 41:40      | Setting up extra screens can be fiddly, but Luna Display couldn't be easier.                           |
| 41:45      | You just plug it in and go.                                                                            |
| 41:47      | Plus everything works over Wi-Fi.                                                                      |

| 41:52      | You can also connect via USB.                                                                          |

| 42:13      | And the all new liquid video engine brings significantly reduced latency and a faster                  |
| 42:17      | screen refresh rate.                                                                                   |

| 42:26      | about my recording for this show.                                                                      |
| 42:28      | If you're heading out of town, throw it in your bag and bring it with your laptop and                  |
| 42:32      | your iPad, and you'll have a secondary screen in your hotel room, or maybe you just want               |
| 42:36      | to sit on your couch and drive your Mac.                                                               |

| 43:17      | We need all of these.                                                                                  |
| 43:18      | We want more.                                                                                          |
| 43:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 43:20      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 43:21      | Something I did recently, and I'm part of my task management stuff because I'm big on                  |
| 43:27      | task management.                                                                                       |
| 43:28      | Sorry for everybody out there, but one of the things that I really like doing is having                |
| 43:34      | a draft and using the link to that draft and saving that as a note.                                    |
| 43:41      | What I will do is, for example, I have a fixes and updates list for my house, and it's all             |
| 43:47      | in [[Drafts]], and it's got checkboxes all the way down of everything that I need to do for                |
| 43:52      | my house.                                                                                              |
| 43:55      | Little things.                                                                                         |
| 43:56      | I need to weed this flowerbed.                                                                         |
| 43:57      | I need to replace this electrical socket.                                                              |
| 43:59      | I need to put a new roof on whatever it is.                                                            |
| 44:03      | Everything's in that big list.                                                                         |
| 44:04      | It's sectioned out, and that's the way I want it because it clutters my [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list                 |
| 44:10      | otherwise.                                                                                             |
| 44:12      | It's not stuff that I can action right away.                                                           |
| 44:14      | If there's going to be an action, I can kick that off to a reminder, and that's fine.                  |
| 44:19      | What I want to do is I want to remind myself of that list, and so I need a way to get to               |
| 44:25      | it quickly.                                                                                            |
| 44:27      | One of the ways you can do that is you can say, hey, dingus, remind me of this, and it                 |
| 44:32      | should work.                                                                                           |
| 44:33      | Sometimes it doesn't, but most of the time it does, and it'll capture the draft, and                   |
| 44:39      | you can go back and forth that way.                                                                    |
| 44:42      | For the times where you're not able to speak to Siri, what I've created is a remind me                 |
| 44:48      | of [[Drafts]] action.                                                                                      |
| 44:50      | This actually works with multiple task managers, and we'll get into that in a minute.                  |
| 44:56      | What this does is this says, all right, I want the title of the draft, and that's going                |
| 45:02      | to be my task name.                                                                                    |
| 45:04      | And then it's going to take that information for just the title.                                       |
| 45:10      | That's all you really need here.                                                                       |
| 45:13      | It's going to prompt you for a date, and if you want an alert.                                         |
| 45:18      | And then at that point, it creates a task, and it creates a task with the title name,                  |
| 45:23      | the due date, time, sets an alert for you, and then also attaches the URL to the specific              |
| 45:31      | draft, which you can get by getting a permalink, and you can read through the script.                  |
| 45:37      | I don't want to really get into the weeds there.                                                       |
| 45:39      | I don't want to put everybody to sleep.                                                                |
| 45:41      | But you can have that note, or have that attached as a note, so that when you use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]],           |
| 45:48      | when you use good tasks, when you use [[OmniFocus]], [[Todoist]], whatever, you can, in fact, just link        |
| 45:55      | back to that specific draft, and that draft could be in archive, it could be flagged,                  |
| 46:00      | it could be in the inbox, it doesn't matter where it's at, it will go to that specific                 |
| 46:04      | draft and load it for you.                                                                             |
| 46:07      | So I'll do that for those kinds of lists.                                                              |
| 46:10      | If I'm writing big blog posts or whatever, I'll also link to those [[Drafts]] as well.                     |
| 46:17      | So I don't have to have multiple different giant lists in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                   |
| 46:24      | I can just link to the specific draft in there.                                                        |
| 46:27      | That is very smart, because this is something that I see people run into quite frequently,             |
| 46:31      | that they're trying to use their task management system almost as a reference system in some           |
| 46:35      | way.                                                                                                   |
| 46:36      | So even if it's just that, hey, I don't know, for example, for me, I need to set a bunch               |
| 46:40      | of custom logging forms by tomorrow morning.                                                           |
| 46:42      | Well, I've got the precise list of custom logging forms and all the details related                    |
| 46:46      | to that in a draft, and I really do have this in a draft, and so I can just use this to                |
| 46:52      | link to that.                                                                                          |
| 46:54      | And so then I can see I need to create custom logging forms, that's my OmniFocus action.               |
| 46:59      | And then I can go back to the draft at any point, which is much more convenient than                   |
| 47:04      | having 42 different actions in my OmniFocus, which are all the same thing, but slightly                |
| 47:09      | different.                                                                                             |
| 47:10      | I mean, this really opens the general idea of [[Drafts]] as an outboard reference system                   |
| 47:15      | that you can have details or information stored in some app or web service, but you can because        |
| 47:23      | of [[Drafts]], scriptability and availability, you can make that the reference area that                   |
| 47:28      | actually contains the text.                                                                            |
| 47:30      | Makes sense.                                                                                           |
| 47:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 47:32      | It does.                                                                                               |
| 47:33      | And I know that my co-host on my podcast, Fundamentally Broken, he actually uses this system for work, |
| 47:43      | and he'll have his work-related projects all in a draft and in a Taskpaper format.                    |
| 47:49      | And then he'll have one single reminder, and he will have that link.                                   |
| 47:55      | So he can have that in his list.                                                                       |
| 47:57      | He knows he needs to do it, but then all of the reference information is there for him,                |
| 48:01      | and he doesn't have to keep moving that from task manager to task manager because that's               |
| 48:05      | something we do.                                                                                       |
| 48:07      | He can just keep that in one place, and you can move around your task managers as you                  |
| 48:10      | see fit.                                                                                               |
| 48:11      | So if I want to switch from [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] to OmniFocus to things to whatever, I don't have to do           |
| 48:15      | a whole lot of movement, and it makes everything a little bit more nimble in the process.              |
| 48:21      | And this is also this automation to remind me of is Tim has generously made that available             |
| 48:28      | at the [[Drafts]] website, so we'll have a link to that one as well.                                       |
| 48:32      | One more thing with this, the one thing that I have in here is there's two main blocks,                |
| 48:39      | and when you actually install this action, [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] is the one that it goes to.                       |
| 48:45      | However, there's a bunch of other script blocks that are disabled.                                     |
| 48:49      | So you can actually disable the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] one and enable the to do is one or the things                |
| 48:54      | one or the OmniFocus one, and it will allow you to enter the same stuff into those applications        |
| 49:02      | through the different scripting options that [[Drafts]] provides.                                          |
| 49:06      | So all of those applications work here.                                                                |
| 49:09      | What a great introduction to scripting in [[Drafts]] too for folks who haven't done it before              |
| 49:13      | because it's already written for you, you just need to enable it, and you can pick it                  |
| 49:18      | apart.                                                                                                 |
| 49:19      | Yeah, and the variables from the first step carry through all of these different actions.              |
| 49:23      | So it just really highlights the power of the scripting in [[Drafts]].                                     |
| 49:28      | It has become the go-to place for me.                                                                  |
| 49:32      | If I need to get anything done, I'm more figuring out how to in [[Drafts]] put it there rather than        |
| 49:42      | go to shortcuts.                                                                                       |
| 49:43      | If it's something that [[Drafts]] just can't do, I'll use shortcuts with it.                               |
| 49:47      | But I try to do everything that I can within [[Drafts]].                                                   |
| 49:51      | That makes sense.                                                                                      |
| 49:52      | I mean, if that's the app that you're in most of the day, why break up your workflow by                |
| 49:55      | going to another application every time?                                                               |
| 49:58      | So that's where [[Drafts]] really can serve you because it can do so much.                                 |
| 50:03      | Like I'm using it for a bunch of ad table stuff.                                                       |
| 50:05      | Previously, this was all in shortcuts.                                                                 |
| 50:07      | And now I've moved a bunch of it out to [[Drafts]] because it's like, well, I'm already in [[Drafts]]          |
| 50:11      | and I have to stop and I have to go and open shortcuts and I have to run the shortcut and              |
| 50:14      | I have to go back to [[Drafts]].                                                                           |
| 50:15      | Wait, why don't I just do this in [[Drafts]] because I can.                                                |
| 50:20      | And that is where the magic is.                                                                        |
| 50:22      | And I love the way that you've done this because it is literally swipe, tap to disable [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]],      |
| 50:27      | swipe, enabled, OmniFocus, done.                                                                       |
| 50:30      | And then I have all of these [[Drafts]] now in my OmniFocus because I've been playing with                 |
| 50:33      | this since you put it in the show notes for us last night.                                             |
| 50:37      | Yeah, and I mean, that's just a really good example of the scripting.                                  |
| 50:42      | There are other things that I've done.                                                                 |
| 50:44      | [[Drafts]] 5.4 came out a few months ago and there was a giant update to one thing that I really           |
| 50:51      | wanted within the app is WordPress integration.                                                        |
| 50:54      | I had been pining for that for a long time.                                                            |
| 50:58      | And I wanted to have at least the ability to do just a regular standard post and a link                |
| 51:03      | post.                                                                                                  |
| 51:04      | And both of those things were made a reality through a lot of time and effort through Greg's           |
| 51:09      | part.                                                                                                  |
| 51:11      | And those are probably some of the most complex actions I've ever created.                             |
| 51:14      | I think, I can't remember exactly, but I think there's something, you know, I think I've               |
| 51:19      | refined it and there's like eight or 10 steps in each one.                                             |
| 51:23      | But what it does is it takes my blog post that I've written, it pops up an HTML preview                |
| 51:28      | of my site and then goes and gets the tags and the categories from my website allows                   |
| 51:35      | me to enter those into that post.                                                                      |
| 51:39      | It sends the draft over to WordPress.                                                                  |
| 51:43      | It actually saves and archives my post automatically in the background and then pops up in the         |
| 51:49      | Safari View Controller, excuse me.                                                                     |
| 51:53      | It actually pops up in the Safari View Controller, the interface for WordPress so that I can           |
| 52:00      | modify anything I need to on the site if I really want to, or I can just hit publish                   |
| 52:06      | and it's done.                                                                                         |
| 52:07      | It's a super complex action.                                                                           |
| 52:09      | There's a lot of scripting involved with it, but it's just something that I don't need                 |
| 52:13      | to now have another application to do my WordPress publishing.                                         |
| 52:18      | Have you shared that, Tim, blog post or anything?                                                      |
| 52:22      | Yeah, so I actually wrote a review for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/) at that time, so it's on their site.                |
| 52:27      | I think I put the link in the show notes and it's something that I've refined and I've                 |
| 52:33      | updated those actions continually so that people can have the latest and greatest.                     |
| 52:38      | But it's something that has just saved me so much effort and one of the apps that I                    |
| 52:44      | used to use, I love Ulysses.                                                                           |
| 52:46      | I really do.                                                                                           |
| 52:47      | It's a beautiful application.                                                                          |
| 52:49      | It's just not something that I need now with having this in [[Drafts]] and that's my personal              |
| 52:56      | choice so everybody can use what they want.                                                            |
| 52:58      | But for me, it eliminates me having an app that I don't necessarily need to keep around                |
| 53:06      | and minimises my space.                                                                                |
| 53:08      | That makes sense because why use six or seven apps when you can have one app that you enjoy            |
| 53:13      | using that does everything for you.                                                                    |
| 53:14      | I have to say, some people are very anti-subscription, but I'd like to point out [[Drafts]] is $20 a year. |
| 53:21      | That gives you iOS and macOS plus whatever updates come and boy, oh boy, I mean, something             |
| 53:27      | we should probably mention.                                                                            |
| 53:29      | You've been talking about version five and 5.4.                                                        |
| 53:32      | Version 11 has come out recently as we record this and that's just because the version numbering.      |
| 53:38      | They're limited to three figures on macOS and four on iOS, which meant that agile torches              |
| 53:44      | couldn't maintain the numbering system they've been using on iOS so they switched to go to             |
| 53:49      | version 11, straight to 11.                                                                            |
| 53:52      | Turn it up to 11.                                                                                      |
| 53:53      | Perfect.                                                                                               |
| 53:54      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 53:55      | Yeah, I mean, there are constantly great updates coming and I'm finding that [[Drafts]] has earned         |
| 54:01      | its money's worth and probably about eight times that just because of how much I get                   |
| 54:04      | done in it and also one thing I should mention is you made me switch to WordPress because              |
| 54:10      | of the actions that you posted on [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/).                                                          |
| 54:12      | So thank you.                                                                                          |
| 54:13      | You're welcome.                                                                                        |
| 54:14      | I had to switch CMS.                                                                                   |
| 54:15      | Well, I'm sorry about that.                                                                            |
| 54:17      | That's okay.                                                                                           |
| 54:18      | You're forgiven.                                                                                       |
| 54:19      | Rose, if it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.                                                   |
| 54:21      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 54:22      | It's interesting to me because [[Drafts]] in my head since the beginning has been this great               |
| 54:28      | place to capture and process text.                                                                     |
| 54:31      | That's my internal, even using the fancy scripts and everything, [[Drafts]] is a place text goes           |
| 54:37      | into and then something happens to it.                                                                 |
| 54:39      | But there's a lot of people, Tim included, who are now using [[Drafts]] as their kind of                   |
| 54:44      | text bank.                                                                                             |
| 54:45      | I still use Ulysses.                                                                                   |
| 54:46      | I have two of them.                                                                                    |
| 54:47      | I'm very fancy.                                                                                        |
| 54:50      | But you could, I mean, because they have tagging support, this is a high quality application.          |
| 54:57      | If you wanted, you could use this application as storage and text maintenance as well as               |
| 55:05      | text capture.                                                                                          |
| 55:07      | And I use the, there's kind of two main large areas that I use [[Drafts]] for.                             |
| 55:14      | And one of them is obviously my blog posts and publishing.                                             |
| 55:17      | And then the other one is journalling.                                                                  |
| 55:20      | And there was a recent episode about journalling and for, I believe, Mac Power users.                   |
| 55:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:28      | So it, it talked about day one is using that as a journal, which is a wonderful application.           |
| 55:35      | Something that I'm going to have coming up and it's just a matter of time for me.                      |
| 55:38      | But it's, I've, I used it one point in time, [[Drafts]] with workflow at the time to roll my               |
| 55:46      | own solution for making a journal.                                                                     |
| 55:51      | And I've kind of adopted that into shortcuts, refined some things here and there and I'm               |
| 55:56      | working through kind of an update of that right now.                                                   |
| 55:59      | So I can share all of that information with everybody.                                                 |
| 56:03      | And that's another subscription that I don't necessarily need to have.                                 |
| 56:06      | Again, day one, wonderful app.                                                                         |
| 56:09      | It's not something maybe that I need to keep around when I have other things to do it for              |
| 56:12      | me.                                                                                                    |
| 56:13      | So if, if I, if I'm making the personal choice of saying, Hey, okay, Ulysses, I'm not going            |
| 56:19      | to use that because I'm going to use [[Drafts]] and day one, I'm not going to use that.                    |
| 56:21      | I'm going to use [[Drafts]].                                                                               |
| 56:23      | I'm saving myself money, even though it's $20 a year.                                                  |
| 56:26      | Now I'm saving those subscriptions as well.                                                            |
| 56:28      | And that, that's a lot of money per year, right?                                                       |
| 56:30      | So I'm, I, I'm getting a huge benefit for me.                                                          |
| 56:34      | And it's now a place because of the changes with workspaces in version five, it's now                  |
| 56:40      | a place that this is possible in the, in the previous version of [[Drafts]].                               |
| 56:43      | It wouldn't have been possible to do this, but now that you can do this with workspaces                |
| 56:48      | and action groups, it, it becomes this modular place that you can say, all right, I'm in               |
| 56:53      | my writing app and I'm in my task management app.                                                      |
| 56:56      | I'm in my journalling app and I don't have to leave the screen.                                         |
| 57:01      | And that's just super powerful.                                                                        |
| 57:02      | And you've got that place, not only to create the journal entries, but also to store them.             |
| 57:09      | And once again, you can tag them.                                                                      |
| 57:10      | You can have the text transformations we talked about earlier.                                         |
| 57:13      | You can have the TextExpander support, all that stuff built into this writing app for                 |
| 57:18      | you.                                                                                                   |
| 57:19      | That makes sense.                                                                                      |
| 57:20      | I understand why people are doing it.                                                                  |
| 57:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 57:22      | If you have any other workspaces, obviously you've got like, I'm guessing your blog post               |
| 57:27      | one and your journal one, but what other workspaces have you got him?                                  |
| 57:31      | So I have a, I have a general one, which is basically everything that's not to do item                 |
| 57:36      | or sorry, not a to do item.                                                                            |
| 57:39      | It's everything that's not a journal item.                                                             |
| 57:41      | It's everything that's not a writing item.                                                             |
| 57:43      | Everything else is in there.                                                                           |
| 57:45      | And then I also have one for my job, my day job, I work in automotive, not going to disclose           |
| 57:51      | here, but I work in automotive and I have some very specific things that I do at work                  |
| 57:56      | and I've customised the actions to make that work for me.                                              |
| 58:01      | This meeting that I said that I, I host for 200 people, I'm writing the notes down for                 |
| 58:06      | that meeting in [[Drafts]].                                                                                |
| 58:09      | And then at the end of it, I actually kick it over to a shortcut that's formatted with                 |
| 58:13      | HTML and I make a PDF in shortcuts.                                                                    |
| 58:16      | And then I save that to Google drive.                                                                  |
| 58:19      | And I capture that all in about 10 seconds.                                                            |
| 58:22      | And I don't have to worry about sending that to myself, creating a document at work, uploading         |
| 58:29      | the file.                                                                                              |
| 58:30      | I just save a lot of time.                                                                             |
| 58:32      | And so that's another big one for me.                                                                  |
| 58:36      | And then I have a kind of a social one.                                                                |
| 58:38      | And those are the main ones that I use all the time.                                                   |
| 58:41      | I have others that are all hidden and actually one of the things in the latest version of              |
| 58:46      | [[Drafts]], you can actually select which action groups you show.                                          |
| 58:50      | So for someone like myself who has, I don't know, probably 20 or 30 action groups that                 |
| 58:55      | I've installed over time, I don't have to show them all, which is nice.                                |
| 58:59      | I have access to them, but I don't have to show them.                                                  |
| 59:01      | So it's cleaned up a lot for me.                                                                       |
| 59:02      | Yeah, that's something I need to go through and do.                                                    |
| 59:04      | I realised the other day I have three action groups called basic.                                      |
| 59:08      | And I installed an action into a basic action group and then I couldn't find it.                       |
| 59:12      | So I had to go through and search.                                                                     |
| 59:14      | Typically I found out with the search that I really need to go and clean up my actions.                |
| 59:17      | Search is your friend.                                                                                 |
| 59:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:19      | And that is really useful as well because sometimes I'm in an action group because that's              |
| 59:22      | the action group assigned to a workspace and I'm going, you know what, I actually need                 |
| 59:26      | an action that I don't usually need in this workspace.                                                 |
| 59:28      | Search for it, run it, find it, done.                                                                  |
| 59:32      | And I have a big miscellaneous action group for that purpose is a bunch of stuff that                  |
| 59:36      | I don't even ever keep track of.                                                                       |
| 59:38      | I just add that.                                                                                       |
| 59:39      | It's like, oh, hey, there's this one off I might want to look at someday.                              |
| 59:42      | And that's when I put it in and it's searchable so I can find it.                                      |
| 59:46      | I do think that, you know, action inflation, I guess, for lack of a better word can be                 |
| 59:50      | a problem.                                                                                             |
| 59:52      | Even just out of the box, it has stuff in there for Evernote and it has stuff for all                  |
| 59:57      | sorts of different apps that maybe you use or don't use.                                               |
| 01:00:00   | And as a user, you've got an easy ability to go in and edit, delete, move.                             |
| 01:00:04   | And I think if you want to use this app and you're having a little trouble getting started             |
| 01:00:09   | going in and getting rid of the actions that you'll never use and putting the ones you                 |
| 01:00:13   | really want on the top of the list is a great way to get yourself using the app more.                  |
| 01:00:18   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:19   | Absolutely.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:20   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:00:21   | Well, listen, Tim, thank you so much for coming on and sharing some of your remarkable scripts         |
| 01:00:27   | with the audience.                                                                                     |
| 01:00:28   | And we're going to have links for all these so you can go download them, gang.                         |
| 01:00:31   | And, you know, I just continue to believe [[Drafts]] is one of the key automation tools                    |
| 01:00:36   | on iOS and now on Mac as it grows on Mac.                                                              |
| 01:00:41   | To me, [[Drafts]] was for a while the only automation on iOS.                                              |
| 01:00:45   | You know, they were one of the very first ones to the game, really.                                    |
| 01:00:50   | Now that we've got [[Shortcuts\|Siri Shortcuts]], there's other options as well.                                    |
| 01:00:52   | But if you do anything with words and you don't check out [[Drafts]], you're doing yourself                |
| 01:00:57   | a disservice.                                                                                          |
| 01:00:58   | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:59   | Agreed.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:00   | Tim, where can we find you?                                                                            |
| 01:01:01   | Give us some links.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:02   | Where can people go and stalk you in the friendliest of matters on the Internet?                       |
| 01:01:06   | Well, I'm on Twitter, kind of, somewhat, sort of.                                                      |
| 01:01:11   | So I'm at Nahumck on Twitter, just my last name.                                                       |
| 01:01:14   | That'll be in the show notes for everybody because that's really hard to spell.                        |
| 01:01:17   | My website is Nahumck.me.                                                                              |
| 01:01:20   | Hopefully soon I'll put up this journal post and that's something that I'm working towards             |
| 01:01:25   | actually right now.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:27   | Occasionally over at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), but those are the main three places.                                 |
| 01:01:31   | And then, of course, if you want to hear my podcast, it's called Fundamentally Broken.                 |
| 01:01:36   | It's with Seth Clifford.                                                                               |
| 01:01:37   | And just a fair warning that's not necessarily the safest for work or kids.                            |
| 01:01:42   | But we get into some automation stuff.                                                                 |
| 01:01:45   | We get into some task management, how we do things, the why we do things.                              |
| 01:01:49   | But yeah, there's a little bit of swearing involved, too.                                              |
| 01:01:52   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:01:53   | So thank you to our sponsors, TextExpander and Luna Display, and we'll see you next time.            |

| 00:00      | Welcome to the Automators, episode three where we talk about some automation with our pal                                                                                |
| 00:06      | Sal Soghoian.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:07      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:08      | We are very excited to have Sal on the show here today.                                                                                                                  |
| 00:11      | For those of you who don't know him, he's possibly the most important person in the                                                                                      |
| 00:14      | automation world.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:15      | Isn't that right, David?                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:17      | When we started the show, we were like, well, we're going to have guests too, of course.                                                                                 |
| 00:20      | In fact, to you listeners out there, if you've got a really cool automation workflow, let                                                                                |
| 00:24      | us know in the forums because we're going to pick a few and we're going to have some                                                                                     |
| 00:28      | of you on the feature.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:30      | But the obvious first guest was Sal.                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:33      | Sal, welcome to the show.                                                                                                                                                |
| 00:35      | Thank you so much.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:36      | I am just so pleased to be here.                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:39      | I am so pleased that automation is an exciting topic once again.                                                                                                         |
| 00:44      | Amen, brother.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 00:45      | Amen.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:46      | We had Sal on the Mac Power users, so I'm going to put a link in the show notes where                                                                                    |
| 00:49      | we talked at length, but the real quick short summary of it is I first met Sal when he taught                                                                            |
| 00:55      | [[AppleScript]] at the Mac World Expo years ago.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00      | He did a two-day course on it, and I have used the stuff Sal taught me in that course                                                                                    |
| 01:05      | for, I don't know, something like 10 years now, all the time to help me get automation                                                                                   |
| 01:10      | better.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11      | And for the longest time, Sal was the term product manager.                                                                                                              |
| 01:15      | I mean, you were basically the guy for automation at Apple for a long time.                                                                                              |
| 01:19      | My job was kind of overloaded.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21      | My title was product manager automation technologies, but I also functioned as the dev representer                                                                       |
| 01:29      | and I would, the public meeting presenter and PR guy and a bunch of other things too.                                                                                    |
| 01:36      | We're all encompassed within that title.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:38      | Well, I mean, the fact that Sal loves automation and it's infectious if you spend any time                                                                               |
| 01:44      | with him because there's so many ways you can make your life easier with this stuff.                                                                                     |
| 01:49      | And now you're not with Apple, but you're still doing that.                                                                                                              |
| 01:51      | You're helping [[Omni Group\|Omni]] with the [[JavaScript]] implementation they're doing.                                                                                |
| 01:55      | You're constantly publishing stuff over at Mac automation, I'm sorry, macosxautomation.com.                                                                              |
| 02:02      | And you're just a treasure of the community for the automation stuff, I mean, honestly.                                                                                  |
| 02:08      | Definitely.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:09      | I mean, I wouldn't have got started with AppleScript if it hadn't been for you and your                                                                                  |
| 02:12      | websites.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02:13      | So thank you because I'm here today because of you.                                                                                                                      |
| 02:16      | I am so impressed and inspired.                                                                                                                                          |
| 02:19      | That's amazing.                                                                                                                                                          |

| 02:40      | I have an Apple badge.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:43      | I work as a contractor with HCS which is Craig Cohen's organisation for the enterprise team                                                                              |
| 02:51      | at Apple.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02:52      | I help them to develop automation tools for setting up iOS devices using Macs.                                                                                           |
| 03:01      | And so some of that stuff that we developed early during my time at Apple, we're still                                                                                   |
| 03:07      | using and advancing and it's really incredible.                                                                                                                          |
| 03:10      | Just give a shout out to JD and Adam and Ricardo and the rest of the team over there.                                                                                    |
| 03:16      | They're doing a really great job on automating iOS devices using Macs.                                                                                                   |
| 03:22      | And are they using AppleScript for that?                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:24      | Or I don't know if you can say at all.                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:26      | AppleScript comes into play quite a bit.                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:27      | It's mostly based on automator.                                                                                                                                          |
| 03:30      | They use workflows upon attachment to automate the setup of iOS devices for companies, usually                                                                           |
| 03:38      | large installations and maybe tens of thousands of iOS devices where they might not have access                                                                          |
| 03:46      | to a network or the convenience of just being able to plug and go is really important.                                                                                   |
| 03:54      | So we developed that technology.                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:57      | I worked with the configurator team, Todd Fernandez and the configurator team, and we                                                                                    |
| 04:03      | developed an architecture for that.                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:05      | And I document a lot of that at [configautomation.com](https://configautomation.com), which you can get to from the [macosxautomation.com](https://macosxautomation.com) |
| 04:13      | master site.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 04:15      | And gang, if you're, first of all, this is an episode we want you to listen to in front                                                                                  |
| 04:20      | of a computer because Sal, as the first guest, has set the bar so high that I don't think                                                                                |
| 04:26      | any future guest will match.                                                                                                                                             |
| 04:28      | We're going to get into the weeds on some AppleScript today because that's what we                                                                                       |
| 04:32      | do on the show.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:33      | Sal set up a website for you.                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:35      | So if you go to macosxautomation.com/automators, you'll see how he did that.                                                                                             |
| 04:41      | There's a whole [[AppleScript]] there that's annotated for you.                                                                                                          |
| 04:44      | It's got videos to show.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 04:45      | And we're going to talk through it on the show today.                                                                                                                    |
| 04:47      | So I think one of the best ways to get your very first lesson in auto script from Apple                                                                                  |
| 04:52      | script from the guy is to sit down, listen to our show and just open that website on                                                                                     |
| 04:57      | your Mac and you're going to get the code and everything you need.                                                                                                       |
| 05:01      | Before we get started, I think if anybody's getting serious about AppleScript, one thing                                                                                 |
| 05:05      | I would recommend you do, Apple has a built-in AppleScript editor on your Mac.                                                                                           |
| 05:09      | But if you want to get serious about the stuff, the app that I've been using, and Sal told                                                                               |
| 05:13      | me about this app way, way long ago when I took his course, is you want to get yourself                                                                                  |
| 05:19      | over to late night software.                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:20      | There's an app called [[Script Debugger]].                                                                                                                               |
| 05:22      | And for years I paid for this app, bought it, they had a purchase system.                                                                                                |
| 05:27      | Now they've got a thing where you can, I believe you can just download it and upgrade your                                                                               |
| 05:30      | license once you get into it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:32      | So anybody can download it and get the basic features with it.                                                                                                           |
| 05:35      | And it's, in my opinion, far superior to the [[Script Editor\|AppleScript editor]] in the built-in to the                                                                |
| 05:41      | Mac OS.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:42      | It's a wonderful tool.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:44      | It's got a complete free trial for the first 20 days as well, which is really, really good                                                                               |
| 05:48      | for testing it out.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:49      | I highly recommend it.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:51      | One of the tricks of [[AppleScript]] is the libraries.                                                                                                                   |
| 05:53      | And you know, it's a real challenge to do this on a podcast because it's a programming                                                                                   |
| 05:58      | language, but the libraries into the applications is what gets you the magic ability to automate                                                                         |
| 06:03      | them.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:04      | And Script Debugger's libraries are amazing.                                                                                                                             |
| 06:08      | Another thing is I want to plant a seed.                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:09      | We're going to talk about this later in the show, but Sal's getting ready to do a whole                                                                                  |
| 06:13      | three-day conference on [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:15      | And that's going to be in October in Cartersville, Georgia, going to the South this time.                                                                                |
| 06:22      | It's called the [[Command-D Down Home Scripting Bootcamp]].                                                                                                              |
| 06:27      | And we are going to have a code for you at the end of the show to get you $200 off.                                                                                      |
| 06:31      | So we have a lot to talk about.                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:34      | But this is the automator, so we like to get nerdy.                                                                                                                      |
| 06:36      | So let's start out talking a little bit about this [[AppleScript]] implementation that Sal                                                                               |
| 06:40      | shared with us.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:41      | A lot of people always ask me when they want to get into [[AppleScript]], they're like, I'm                                                                              |
| 06:45      | not really sure how I use it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:47      | I understand that there's this great language out there that lets me connect apps together                                                                               |
| 06:51      | and make my Mac do things without me having to trouble with it.                                                                                                          |
| 06:55      | But where do I start?                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:57      | And I asked that question of Sal and he put together this really great tutorial for us.                                                                                  |
| 07:01      | So how do we start there?                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:04      | So once again, this is at macosxautomation.com/automators.                                                                                                               |
| 07:08      | So if you're listening in your car, this is one I would pause right now and just wait                                                                                    |
| 07:12      | till you get home and from your Mac because looking at the code is going to make this                                                                                    |
| 07:15      | way easier for you.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:17      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:18      | And Sal's been really great here and he's got a complete downloadable zip file with everything                                                                           |
| 07:23      | in it that you're going to need to get started and play.                                                                                                                 |
| 07:25      | All right, so what is this script about?                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:27      | So when you asked me about doing the podcast, the thousands of scripts that I've written                                                                                 |
| 07:36      | or seen in my life, I said, you know, is there some type of script that shows some of the                                                                                |
| 07:42      | basic power behind AppleScript and some of the remarkable abilities that it has, but                                                                                     |
| 07:48      | at the same time is quite functional and easy to understand.                                                                                                             |
| 07:53      | And my mind instantly went to this script and what the script does is it takes a table                                                                                   |
| 08:03      | in numbers and takes the data from the table and makes a chart in a slide on keynote.                                                                                    |
| 08:13      | And just the act of being able to run the script, it grabs the data, reformats it and                                                                                    |
| 08:20      | transfers it and transforms it into a visual chart in another application.                                                                                               |
| 08:28      | And it does so with a really small amount of [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                            |
| 08:32      | And I thought, wow, this is a great example for showing the transformative power of automation.                                                                          |
| 08:40      | And that's what the script is.                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:43      | It starts off in numbers and it finds the table, extracts the data, stores the data,                                                                                     |
| 08:51      | then goes to keynote and runs a command for creating a chart and passing in the data that                                                                                |
| 08:57      | it had previously extracted.                                                                                                                                             |
| 08:59      | And that's the basic principle behind it.                                                                                                                                |
| 09:02      | And once you've saved it and installed it into the system-wide script menu, it's there                                                                                   |
| 09:08      | for you at any time.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:09      | So you can just select the script from the script menu and instantly the data from the                                                                                   |
| 09:16      | current table you're looking at turns into a chart in keynote.                                                                                                           |
| 09:21      | And then because you guys are my favourite people, I added two other scripts that you                                                                                    |
| 09:28      | can also use based on the same script where you can select a row or a column in the table                                                                                |
| 09:36      | and use that data from that row or that column and turn it into a pie chart.                                                                                             |
| 09:42      | So it's really useful.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 09:45      | And then you start realising, it just takes a small amount of effort to make this script                                                                                 |
| 09:51      | and to spend, what, 15 minutes to install it, create it, put it on your machine.                                                                                         |
| 09:57      | But then every time you use it, think of how much time that is saving you from having to                                                                                 |
| 10:03      | figure out how to grab that data from the table, how to go to keynote, how to create                                                                                     |
| 10:11      | the slide, how to create a chart, then how to populate the chart with the data that you                                                                                  |
| 10:17      | want, that could take an hour to do by hand.                                                                                                                             |
| 10:22      | And it gets done in a second using [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                                      |
| 10:27      | So that's really what's going on with this particular script.                                                                                                            |
| 10:31      | This script really reminds me of my Hallelujah moment with [[AppleScript]].                                                                                              |
| 10:35      | It was like I said, I was taking your course.                                                                                                                            |
| 10:37      | At the time, I was seriously considering getting into [[Xcode]], really going all in, because                                                                            |
| 10:44      | I used to program computers all the time, kind of fell off the wagon for a long time.                                                                                    |
| 10:48      | I thought it would be fun.                                                                                                                                               |
| 10:49      | I mean, the tools now in a lot of ways are easier than they used to be in a lot of ways                                                                                  |
| 10:52      | they're harder.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:53      | But I thought, but I also have a career and other things I want to do.                                                                                                   |
| 10:57      | And I know people that spend all of their time program computers, and it's a never-ending                                                                                |
| 11:01      | struggle.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11:02      | But when I realised that with [[AppleScript]], I could take the fruits of others, I could                                                                                |
| 11:08      | take the work that the Omni Group does and that the Smile does on PDF pan and these                                                                                      |
| 11:12      | companies do, and I could glue them together in ways that I wanted them to work and make                                                                                 |
| 11:18      | them do stuff for me that the developers had never even dreamed of.                                                                                                      |
| 11:23      | All I had to do is learn [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                                                |
| 11:25      | That was like the moment for me when I realised, oh, this is where I need to spend my time,                                                                              |
| 11:29      | because I am a power user.                                                                                                                                               |
| 11:30      | I'm not a programmer.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:32      | And this stuff is great.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11:33      | And that's why I love this script, because it takes two apps.                                                                                                            |
| 11:36      | Then you do the work in [[Numbers]], but it automatically creates the chart for you in [[Keynote]].                                                                      |
| 11:41      | And I can tell you, the [[Numbers]] team never had the idea of doing this.                                                                                               |
| 11:45      | It's not a feature you're ever going to find built into the application.                                                                                                 |
| 11:48      | But like we said, this is 17 lines of code and you do this.                                                                                                              |
| 11:53      | And it's [[AppleScript]], so it's not even that hard of code.                                                                                                            |
| 11:56      | It's easy to just understand.                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:59      | Could you walk us through just kind of, because let's assume people have taken our advice.                                                                               |
| 12:03      | They're looking at your code now on the website.                                                                                                                         |
| 12:05      | Just walk us through kind of the basics of what the point is of some of these lines in                                                                                   |
| 12:09      | here.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12:10      | Like for instance, the first line is tell application open quote numbers, close quote.                                                                                   |
| 12:15      | So that is a line that you're always going to see when you're addressing an application                                                                                  |
| 12:19      | in [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12:20      | It just gets the ball rolling.                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:22      | It tells the computer where you're, you know, what sandbox you just jumped into.                                                                                         |
| 12:27      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12:28      | [[AppleScript]], when they came up with the idea for [[AppleScript]] a long time ago, before System                                                                      |
| 12:33      | 7, the thought was, is there a way that basically what the user's thinking, you could just have                                                                          |
| 12:43      | them write that down and the computer would understand that?                                                                                                             |
| 12:48      | It's kind of very close to the idea of natural language like Siri uses, where the user says,                                                                             |
| 12:55      | hey, you know, find me a grocery store nearby that sells fresh tomatoes.                                                                                                 |
| 13:03      | And somehow that gets understood and translated.                                                                                                                         |
| 13:06      | So the idea was, can you have a natural language that the user could write that would actually                                                                           |
| 13:12      | control the applications on the computer?                                                                                                                                |
| 13:16      | And [[AppleScript]] has an English-like syntax.                                                                                                                          |
| 13:19      | It's very close to English.                                                                                                                                              |
| 13:22      | There are a certain couple of things that are more stilted about it, but generally you                                                                                   |
| 13:28      | can say things that are what you're thinking of.                                                                                                                         |
| 13:33      | For example, I can say tell application finder to duplicate every file of the folder documents                                                                           |
| 13:42      | of home whose name contains Sparky to the desktop.                                                                                                                       |
| 13:48      | And it will do what I just said.                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:52      | Now on the computer, when you're dealing with [[AppleScript]], you need to tell the computer                                                                             |
| 13:57      | who you're talking to.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:00      | And in this particular case, we're talking to two applications, [[Numbers]] and [[Keynote]].                                                                             |
| 14:06      | So the first part of our script, lines one through 10, are dealing with the Numbers application.                                                                         |
| 14:14      | So when we have a multiple line script, we encase the statements that are dealing with                                                                                   |
| 14:22      | Numbers in a tell block.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:24      | And that means we're going to start off by telling application numbers.                                                                                                  |
| 14:30      | And that's a way of waking it up and saying, hey, we're going to be talking to you.                                                                                      |
| 14:35      | And then we give it all our various script statements.                                                                                                                   |
| 14:37      | And when we're done, we say end tell.                                                                                                                                    |
| 14:41      | So that just means that anything between the first line and line 10 is going to be targeted                                                                              |
| 14:47      | at the Numbers application.                                                                                                                                              |
| 14:49      | And that's called a tell block.                                                                                                                                          |
| 14:52      | There's two types of tells.                                                                                                                                              |
| 14:53      | A tell statement would be a one line script, tell application numbers to activate.                                                                                       |
| 15:01      | Tell block would be a multiple line script beginning with the targeted application and                                                                                   |
| 15:07      | ending with end tell.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:09      | So somebody wrote tell application numbers to activate.                                                                                                                  |
| 15:13      | What would happen?                                                                                                                                                       |
| 15:14      | That's a one line script.                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:15      | What happens when you do that?                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:17      | Then what happens is that gets translated into what they call Apple events.                                                                                              |
| 15:22      | There's an underlying architecture that [[AppleScript]] sits on top of.                                                                                                  |
| 15:27      | It's a messaging architecture called [[Apple Events]].                                                                                                                   |
| 15:30      | And it's a way for applications and the system to send messages to each other.                                                                                           |
| 15:35      | And what happens is the application numbers gets sent a message to start up and come forward.                                                                            |
| 15:43      | The word activate gets translated into that message, start up and come forward, become                                                                                   |
| 15:50      | the front most application.                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:52      | So it just pulls it forward and like people can organise their desktops with a couple                                                                                    |
| 15:57      | simple [[AppleScript]] commands.                                                                                                                                         |
| 15:58      | I mean, if you're ready to podcast, you can say tell application [[Skype]] to activate.                                                                                  |
| 16:05      | Tell application [[Safari]] to activate.                                                                                                                                 |
| 16:07      | And then you can even drive it to a certain web page so you could get your notes up.                                                                                     |
| 16:14      | I know people that do that.                                                                                                                                              |
| 16:16      | Tell application Safari to set the URL of the front window to macautomation.com.                                                                                         |
| 16:27      | And the great thing about this is there are dictionaries built into Mac OS and so many                                                                                   |
| 16:33      | applications like, for example, OmniFocus have a dictionary, which means that if you're                                                                                  |
| 16:38      | looking for language specific to controlling a certain application, you can find that it's                                                                               |
| 16:44      | right there in the documentation built into your Mac, which is really, really powerful.                                                                                  |
| 16:49      | So you can find out exactly what you can do with these things.                                                                                                           |
| 16:51      | And it's all explained there for you.                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:54      | Every application that is scriptable or will respond to the Apple events carries an internal                                                                             |
| 17:00      | dictionary that you can view and it tells you, these are my commands.                                                                                                    |
| 17:05      | These are what I understand.                                                                                                                                             |
| 17:07      | These are my objects like a document or a slide or text box or an image.                                                                                                 |
| 17:13      | And these are the properties that those objects have, like a height, a width, a colour.                                                                                  |
| 17:19      | And what you do with [[AppleScript]], it's very conversational, you take a set of verbs and                                                                              |
| 17:25      | you match them with the objects and properties.                                                                                                                          |
| 17:28      | So you could say, set the colour of the current box to blue.                                                                                                             |
| 17:33      | And you've created an [[AppleScript]] statement that is very much like an English-like sentence.                                                                         |
| 17:42      | So quite often with [[AppleScript]], you can read the code and understand exactly what it's                                                                              |
| 17:48      | doing, which is in contrast to other languages like [[Swift]] or [[Objective C]] or [[C++]] or stuff                                                                     |
| 17:57      | like that, where you have to really look at what's going on because things are typed                                                                                     |
| 18:03      | from the top down and you're trying to figure out, okay, what's really happening here?                                                                                   |
| 18:09      | What is this variable?                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:10      | What's holding?                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:11      | What's in that?                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:12      | With [[AppleScript]], let's look at the second line here, tell the first table of the active                                                                             |
| 18:18      | sheet of the front document.                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:21      | So that means we're targeting a very specific object that's in the front document.                                                                                       |
| 18:28      | And you'll notice the word front, that indicates [[AppleScript]]'s way of saying the first item,                                                                         |
| 18:36      | the first document, and maybe a stack of documents.                                                                                                                      |
| 18:39      | On the Mac, we can have multiple documents open simultaneously.                                                                                                          |
| 18:44      | So [[AppleScript]] needs a way to indicate which one is the one you want to talk to.                                                                                     |
| 18:50      | And in this case, in the English language, we use the word front all the time.                                                                                           |
| 18:56      | If there's a row of people lining up, you can say, well, the first person or the front                                                                                   |
| 19:01      | person, the person at the front, please come forward.                                                                                                                    |
| 19:05      | And [[AppleScript]] uses that as well.                                                                                                                                   |
| 19:08      | So that means it's looking at, in the [[Numbers]] spreadsheet, it's looking at the front number                                                                          |
| 19:11      | spreadsheet.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:12      | It's just looking at the front sheet you have.                                                                                                                           |
| 19:14      | And if you had two and you had one behind it, you want to look from the one behind you                                                                                   |
| 19:18      | would change the word front to what?                                                                                                                                     |
| 19:20      | The second.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:22      | Or you can even say the sheet behind the first sheet, if you wanted to.                                                                                                  |
| 19:28      | So I mean, there's a lot of ways to, in English, we use positional identification quite a bit.                                                                           |
| 19:34      | Well, the third person in the second row, please stand up, or you can use properties as a way                                                                            |
| 19:42      | of identifying.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:43      | You can say, well, everyone who has red hair, please stand up.                                                                                                           |
| 19:49      | There's different ways of identification.                                                                                                                                |
| 19:52      | And [[AppleScript]] incorporates those so that you don't have to know any particular programming                                                                         |
| 19:59      | construct to be able to target the object you want.                                                                                                                      |
| 20:02      | And that same thing happens again at the beginning of that line, too, where it says, tell the                                                                            |
| 20:08      | first table.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 20:10      | So if there's four tables on that spreadsheet or on that page, you're talking to the first                                                                               |
| 20:18      | one.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20:19      | And that's a way of identifying that.                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:21      | And you'll notice something else.                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:23      | In [[AppleScript]] to the world of [[AppleScript]], and basically the way the computers work,                                                                            |
| 20:29      | is everything belongs to or is contained in something else.                                                                                                              |
| 20:33      | For example, a word is contained in a sentence, which is contained in a paragraph, which is                                                                              |
| 20:40      | contained in a story.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:43      | A file is in a folder that's in a folder that's in another folder on a disk.                                                                                             |
| 20:49      | And that's the way things work on the computer.                                                                                                                          |
| 20:53      | And the way you identify something is by identifying its position in the chain of command.                                                                               |
| 21:00      | It's object hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:01      | So we're looking at the first table of the active sheet of the front document.                                                                                           |
| 21:10      | It's like writing an address, you know, 123 Main Street, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States,                                                                                |
| 21:19      | Planet Earth.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:20      | Or the car keys in the drawer in the entry hall, you know.                                                                                                               |
| 21:26      | There you go.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:27      | You've described a containment, what it's called a containment hierarchy.                                                                                                |
| 21:33      | And that's how you identify things.                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:35      | And when you put the word tell before it, it's the way of telling the computer that                                                                                      |
| 21:41      | this is the guy that's going to be doing what I need to do.                                                                                                              |
| 21:45      | In the first two lines, we've used two tell statements.                                                                                                                  |
| 21:47      | The first to say, this is the application we're talking to.                                                                                                              |
| 21:52      | And the second one to say, this is the particular object that we're talking to a table, a very                                                                           |
| 21:57      | specific table.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:59      | And then you do something with it.                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:01      | And then you do something with it.                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:04      | And then what do we do with it is the next three lines in our script where it says set                                                                                   |
| 22:09      | the column titles to the formatted value of cells two through minus one of the first row                                                                                 |
| 22:16      | of the cell range.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:18      | And what happens there is we're describing a range of cells in a row.                                                                                                    |
| 22:24      | So for example, our particular table has a header row and a header column.                                                                                               |
| 22:32      | So we want the data from the table, not the header row.                                                                                                                  |
| 22:36      | And so that's why we're saying cells two through minus one.                                                                                                              |
| 22:41      | And minus one is just a programming way of saying the last guy in the row.                                                                                               |
| 22:47      | Instead of putting in the words last guy in the row there, we're saying cells two through                                                                                |
| 22:51      | minus one of the first row of the cell range.                                                                                                                            |
| 22:56      | And cell range is a property of the table that is a list of positions.                                                                                                   |
| 23:02      | So you don't even have to know this is cell A1C or cell 3B2 or whatever.                                                                                                 |
| 23:10      | You just talk to the cell range and ask AppleScript to find it and it will do that for you.                                                                              |

| 24:22      | Our thanks to TextExpander from Smile for their support of this show.                                                                                                    |
| 24:27      | So the cell range, is that a part of the library entry for numbers?                                                                                                      |
| 24:31      | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:32      | Exactly correct.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:33      | If you look in the dictionary for numbers, if you're in [[Script Debugger]] or the script editor                                                                         |
| 24:39      | and you choose to open dictionary and you can view the entire dictionary of every term                                                                                   |
| 24:45      | that [[Numbers]] knows and every object and all the values, the cell range is a property of                                                                              |
| 24:53      | a table.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 24:55      | And it just means, you know, what you have selected is identifiable by a certain range.                                                                                  |
| 25:02      | If you've ever used [[Microsoft Excel\|Excel]], you'll notice that, you know, when you select something, it'll                                                           |
| 25:07      | tell you, you selected B4 to Q16 and that identifies what is called the cell range.                                                                                      |
| 25:16      | And that's a property in [[AppleScript]] for table and numbers.                                                                                                          |
| 25:21      | So what happens in line two is we're getting the formatted value, which it means, give                                                                                   |
| 25:27      | it to me nicely with the period 00 or whatever is being used or dollar sign or whatever.                                                                                 |
| 25:35      | Give me that and then we're going to store it in a container called column titles.                                                                                       |
| 25:40      | We're making a, what is called a variable and variables are just basically bottles or                                                                                    |
| 25:46      | bowls that you hold stuff in temporarily while you're using it in the script.                                                                                            |
| 25:52      | And the way that you create a variable is very simple.                                                                                                                   |
| 25:57      | You just make up a word that [[AppleScript]] doesn't know or that's not part of the application's                                                                        |
| 26:02      | dictionary and it looks at it and it goes, oh, that's a container.                                                                                                       |
| 26:07      | So I took two words and jammed them together.                                                                                                                            |
| 26:11      | I made them intercapped or [[Camel case]] column titles.                                                                                                                 |
| 26:15      | And that's the name of my variable and it's going to hold all of the data that was extracted                                                                             |
| 26:21      | by my request to get the content of the first row of the cell range.                                                                                                     |
| 26:29      | Then the next line in the script does the same thing and it gets the first column of                                                                                     |
| 26:36      | the cell range.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 26:37      | So what I'm doing in those first two line two, line two, three, sorry, line three and                                                                                    |
| 26:44      | line four is I'm getting the headers.                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:47      | I'm getting the column titles and I'm getting the row titles.                                                                                                            |
| 26:51      | Yeah, because your [[Keynote]] table needs titles and you're just grabbing the variables.                                                                                |
| 26:55      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:56      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 26:57      | I want to keep those and I identify them because I know where they are.                                                                                                  |
| 27:00      | They're the header ones.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 27:01      | So they're the first row or the first column are your header columns.                                                                                                    |
| 27:07      | And so the first two lines of doing something, line three and four, is basically extracting                                                                              |
| 27:13      | that information.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 27:15      | And that's really remarkable when you think about it that one line of [[AppleScript]] will                                                                               |
| 27:19      | give me the contents of all of that row automatically in a nice list of strings or text names, whatever                                                                  |
| 27:28      | the column names or the row editors are, it's going to return those as a nice list of strings.                                                                           |
| 27:35      | And I store both of those in my variables column titles and row titles.                                                                                                  |
| 27:40      | Then the next line, I begin, I want to get the data for the table, all those numbers                                                                                     |
| 27:48      | that are in that table.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 27:49      | And so I make an empty container that's going to hold a list of values.                                                                                                  |
| 27:56      | And I do that, I call table data, I make up a word that [[AppleScript]] doesn't know and                                                                                 |
| 28:02      | it looks at it and says, oh, that's a container.                                                                                                                         |
| 28:04      | And I give it a value of an empty container.                                                                                                                             |
| 28:07      | That's in some programming languages, that's called an array, in [[AppleScript]] you call                                                                                |
| 28:13      | lists, but they're basically anything within curly braces that is separated by commas is                                                                                 |
| 28:21      | a list.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:22      | And so I created an empty list and a variable that's going to hold the data that I'm going                                                                               |
| 28:28      | to extract from the table.                                                                                                                                               |
| 28:30      | Does that make sense so far?                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:32      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 28:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:34      | So the tip I would like to give people is when you use, you can do this in [[Script Debugger]]                                                                           |
| 28:39      | or in [[Script Editor]].                                                                                                                                                 |
| 28:40      | In [[Script Editor]], there's a hammer icon and in [[Script Debugger]], it's the compile button.                                                                         |
| 28:45      | Once you click that, it does syntax highlighting, which for people who don't know, basically                                                                             |
| 28:49      | it makes certain words special colours to help you figure out what they mean.                                                                                            |
| 28:53      | And the variables are always green in both of these.                                                                                                                     |
| 28:56      | They actually use the same syntax highlighting, which is really nice.                                                                                                    |
| 28:59      | And that's really helpful for trying to figure things out so you can follow what you're doing                                                                            |
| 29:03      | quite easily.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:04      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 29:05      | In this particular one, you'll notice that the properties of objects I made like this                                                                                    |
| 29:11      | light blue active sheet formatted value.                                                                                                                                 |
| 29:15      | And then the positional ones I made like a greenish, like first, yeah, the word first                                                                                    |
| 29:22      | and front are that.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:24      | And then things that are objects I made like an orange, like document, cells, rows.                                                                                      |
| 29:30      | So you can begin to see, oh, this is an object and this is the property of that object and                                                                               |
| 29:35      | this is the value of that.                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:39      | And we put them together.                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:41      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:42      | So the next thing we're going to do is line six through eight.                                                                                                           |
| 29:46      | It's only a three lines and it's a repeat loop.                                                                                                                          |
| 29:50      | And the repeat loop means you're going to perform some kind of action multiple times                                                                                     |
| 29:57      | each time with a different object.                                                                                                                                       |
| 30:00      | And in this case, we're going to go through each one of the rows.                                                                                                        |
| 30:07      | We have three rows of data.                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:09      | So the first time we're going to go through row two and then next time is row three, next                                                                                |
| 30:14      | time is row four of data.                                                                                                                                                |
| 30:18      | And then we're going to extract the data from those rows.                                                                                                                |
| 30:21      | That's basically what's going to happen.                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:23      | So that's why we're saying repeat with a I and in this case, I is just a container.                                                                                      |
| 30:31      | Although that is a word I in AppleScript, it's not a word.                                                                                                               |
| 30:36      | So it looks at it as a container.                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:39      | It's called a loop counter and it basically it's just going to each time the loop occurs,                                                                                |
| 30:46      | it's going to have a value indicating the loop that it's going through.                                                                                                  |
| 30:53      | And that loop counter is going to be from two to the count of rows.                                                                                                      |
| 30:58      | So I'm asking AppleScript to count how many rows there are and start at the second one                                                                                   |
| 31:04      | and go to the end.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:05      | So if there's five rows and it starts at the second, it's going to do two, three, four                                                                                   |
| 31:11      | and five.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31:12      | If there's four rows, it's going to start the second and go two, three and four.                                                                                         |
| 31:18      | And each time I will have that value of two, three or four.                                                                                                              |
| 31:23      | The line in between, you'll notice that the repeat is follows of the same kind of construct                                                                              |
| 31:29      | that we have with a tell block where you begin a tell and you end to tell with a repeat loop,                                                                            |
| 31:35      | you begin the repeat.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:37      | And then there's an end repeat that indicates to the computer that this is where I'm stopping                                                                            |
| 31:44      | the repeat.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:45      | So let's just do anything in between those two lines.                                                                                                                    |
| 31:49      | And in this case, we only have one operation we're doing.                                                                                                                |
| 31:53      | It's line seven.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:55      | And it says set the end of the table data to the value of cells two through minus one                                                                                    |
| 32:03      | of row I.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:05      | And let's look at that.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:07      | Set the end of the table data.                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:10      | It's your appending information to a list.                                                                                                                               |
| 32:14      | So if I have a list and my list has three things on it, and I want to add something                                                                                      |
| 32:19      | to the end of the list, this is how you do it in AppleScript.                                                                                                            |
| 32:22      | You say set the end of this list, table data, to the value of cells two through minus one.                                                                               |
| 32:33      | Remember minus one is just in programming a fancy way of saying the last item, the last                                                                                  |
| 32:39      | row, the last column.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:42      | Cells two through minus one, the last cell, of row I.                                                                                                                    |
| 32:46      | And remember I is our loop counter.                                                                                                                                      |
| 32:49      | So each time it's going to be either two, three, or four.                                                                                                                |
| 32:53      | So if this was the second, the first time this loop ran, it would say set the end of                                                                                     |
| 32:59      | the table data to the value of cells two through minus one of row two.                                                                                                   |
| 33:04      | Then to do the same thing again, say row three, and then to do the row four.                                                                                             |
| 33:09      | And what is happening is each time we're doing this, our list gets added to, our table data                                                                              |
| 33:15      | container gets added to, and then we end up with nice three sections in there of multiple                                                                                |
| 33:22      | lists within our table data variable.                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:27      | So you could actually do the same thing, but say set the beginning, right?                                                                                               |
| 33:31      | If you needed to flip your data for whatever reason.                                                                                                                     |
| 33:34      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33:35      | You can use the word beginning.                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:37      | AppleScript understands that.                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:40      | In AppleScript, the index of the first item in a list is one.                                                                                                            |
| 33:46      | In JavaScript, they use a zero index.                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:50      | So the first item is zero, item zero.                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:53      | But AppleScript is more English-like, and in English we don't go, will the zero person                                                                                   |
| 34:00      | please stand up?                                                                                                                                                         |
| 34:01      | We say, well, the first person stand up.                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:03      | So AppleScript uses the one as the index for the first value of a list or an array.                                                                                      |
| 34:12      | And end is identified to show where you're going to be appending the data to instead                                                                                     |
| 34:18      | of beginning or the end.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:19      | You could also say middle.                                                                                                                                               |
| 34:22      | AppleScript uses a lot of positional indicators that are just normal English language.                                                                                   |
| 34:30      | And so then the other, once we've closed off our repeat and we close the Intel for the                                                                                   |
| 34:38      | block talking to the table, and then Intel for the application, we've completed the conversation                                                                         |
| 34:44      | with numbers.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34:46      | And what we have to show for it are three containers, one called column titles that                                                                                      |
| 34:51      | held all of the titles of the columns.                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:55      | We have row title container that contains the column names, the column titles contains                                                                                   |
| 35:03      | the row column names.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 35:06      | And then we have table data that contains the information pulled out of the cells.                                                                                       |
| 35:11      | So we have all, we've cleaned out our table, we've extracted what we need, and we have                                                                                   |
| 35:17      | it in three containers that we can now use with another application.                                                                                                     |
| 35:23      | That's a great thing about [[AppleScript]] is that it makes it easy to transfer data between                                                                             |
| 35:29      | applications.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 35:30      | You don't have to write that data to disk or you don't have to put the data in some                                                                                      |
| 35:35      | other file and then go get it again.                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:38      | In [[AppleScript]], you could just hold it in memory and then switch applications that you're                                                                            |
| 35:44      | talking to and go to the second application and use that data, which is what we'll be                                                                                    |
| 35:49      | doing here.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 35:51      | So next we go over to [[Keynote]].                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:53      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:54      | So lines 12 through 17 through the end of the script, we now have our data from the                                                                                      |
| 36:00      | table and now we're ready to do something with that in [[Keynote]].                                                                                                      |
| 36:04      | And if we were in front of the script editor or in front of [[Script Debugger]] and we opened                                                                            |
| 36:09      | up the dictionary for [[Keynote]], you'll see that not only does [[Keynote]] have an extensive                                                                           |
| 36:15      | scripting dictionary where it talks about documents and slides and transitions and templates                                                                             |
| 36:22      | and all the different things that [[Keynote]] does, it also has sets of commands.                                                                                        |
| 36:30      | Commands are verbs like make, print, close, quit, open, and then there are some specialised                                                                              |
| 36:42      | commands for each application that are commands that just that application does itself.                                                                                  |
| 36:48      | Like an application like [[TextEdit]] would not understand the word rotate that [[Adobe Photoshop\|Photoshop]]                                                         |
| 36:55      | would use.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:57      | So if you were scripting [[Adobe Photoshop]], you would use the word rotate maybe sometimes                                                                              |
| 37:02      | if you were adjusting your images.                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:05      | But [[TextEdit]] doesn't really understand what rotate means and it wouldn't have that as                                                                                |
| 37:11      | a command.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:12      | So that would be a command specific to that application.                                                                                                                 |
| 37:16      | There are some commands that are common to all applications like open, close, quit, print,                                                                               |
| 37:21      | things like that.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:23      | But in this case, the command on line 14 is add chart.                                                                                                                   |
| 37:29      | So [[Keynote]] has a command just for creating charts.                                                                                                                   |
| 37:34      | And we can address that command and use it to target a specific slide.                                                                                                   |
| 37:40      | So line 12 begins our talking to [[Keynote]].                                                                                                                            |
| 37:45      | We're saying tell application Keynote, hello.                                                                                                                            |
| 37:48      | And we begin with the tell block and we end with the tell block at line 17 and anything                                                                                  |
| 37:53      | in between is talking to [[Keynote]].                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:57      | Then we're going to talk to a specific object in that [[Keynote]].                                                                                                       |
| 38:03      | And it's going to be the current slide of the front document.                                                                                                            |
| 38:06      | Now what does current slide mean?                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:09      | Current slide is a property of the document in Keynote.                                                                                                                  |
| 38:14      | And it just means which slide you have selected in the interface.                                                                                                        |
| 38:18      | That's the current slide.                                                                                                                                                |
| 38:20      | So whatever slide the user currently has selected, we're going to be addressing it.                                                                                      |
| 38:26      | So tell the current slide of the front document.                                                                                                                         |
| 38:28      | So if I have two Keynote documents open, it's the one that's on top of the other one.                                                                                    |
| 38:34      | And I'm going to talk to the current slide.                                                                                                                              |
| 38:37      | And then in between the actual command is on line 14 and 15.                                                                                                             |
| 38:43      | It's actually one line, but I couldn't fit it on one line in the page.                                                                                                   |
| 38:49      | So there's a character at the end of line 14 that looks like a line with a little squiggly                                                                               |
| 38:54      | going down.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:56      | That means that's a wrap character.                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:59      | It means that it's an option L. And it means that this is actually the next line is actually                                                                             |
| 39:05      | part of the script statement.                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:08      | But for convenience purposes, I'm wrapping it to the next line so that we can see it                                                                                     |
| 39:14      | easier.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:15      | So the command on line 14 is actually one long statement.                                                                                                                |
| 39:21      | And it is this.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:22      | Add chart.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 39:24      | And then the first parameter for our command, it needs to know what are your row names for                                                                               |
| 39:31      | the chart.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 39:33      | And that's the parameter.                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:35      | Row names, two words.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 39:37      | And I give it that value of row titles, my container.                                                                                                                    |
| 39:42      | So the first parameter of the add chart command is row names.                                                                                                            |
| 39:46      | I pass that my container that contains the row titles.                                                                                                                   |
| 39:51      | Then the second parameter for the command is column names.                                                                                                               |
| 39:56      | And I pass it the container that is holding the column titles.                                                                                                           |
| 40:02      | I say column titles.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:04      | And then the third parameter is data.                                                                                                                                    |
| 40:08      | And I pass it the container that is holding the table data.                                                                                                              |
| 40:12      | Then the next parameter is type.                                                                                                                                         |
| 40:15      | What kind of chart do you want to make?                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:18      | And you'll notice in purple, there's something called vertical underscore bar underscore                                                                                 |
| 40:24      | 2D.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:26      | In the keynote dictionary, they have a textual representation of each one of the possible                                                                                |
| 40:34      | charts.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:36      | And that's what they use for the representation for a vertical bar chart that's 2D, not 3D.                                                                              |
| 40:43      | And I would imagine if you went in that code and changed the 2 to 3, you probably got a                                                                                  |
| 40:47      | 3D chart.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 40:49      | You probably get a 3D chart.                                                                                                                                             |
| 40:51      | You do.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:52      | I just tested it.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40:53      | Yes, there you go.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:55      | And then the last parameter is how do you want this data grouped by?                                                                                                     |
| 40:59      | And I don't know if you've done a lot of charts, but there's an axis.                                                                                                    |
| 41:03      | So you can say I want to group by the column or by the row is really what it is.                                                                                         |
| 41:08      | So grouped by is the parameter.                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:11      | And the value for that is chart row.                                                                                                                                     |
| 41:14      | So I want my column, I want my bar chart to be grouped by the row value.                                                                                                 |
| 41:24      | Because it will invert it for you if you want to.                                                                                                                        |
| 41:27      | And you can always, as you see in the video at the end of this page, I go in and I switch                                                                                |
| 41:32      | the axis to show how that data can be transformed easily within the document itself.                                                                                     |
| 41:40      | So then we close off our tell blocks on the last two lines.                                                                                                              |
| 41:44      | We're finished talking to the current slide and we finished talking to [[Keynote]].                                                                                      |
| 41:49      | And that's it.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 41:50      | In that 17 lines, we have addressed the numbers application, found a specific table, extracted                                                                           |
| 41:58      | the headers, extracted the table data, then addressed [[Keynote]], found the current document,                                                                           |
| 42:05      | the current slide in the front document, and then converted that data into a chart.                                                                                      |
| 42:13      | All within 17 lines of [[AppleScript]] and it happens in a fraction of a second when you                                                                                 |
| 42:18      | actually run it.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:20      | That's pretty amazing.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:21      | It is.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:22      | And just imagine if you had to go to your boss every Wednesday and give a presentation                                                                                   |
| 42:26      | and you had to incorporate a chart and you had the date already.                                                                                                         |
| 42:30      | Running this [[AppleScript]] automates that process for you.                                                                                                             |
| 42:34      | And this is just a jumping off point.                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:35      | We've given you the code, sales written, you can download it and use it as is.                                                                                           |
| 42:39      | Or you can start changing the chart types.                                                                                                                               |
| 42:41      | Or you can start, just go in there and start fiddling with it.                                                                                                           |
| 42:45      | You can always redownload it if it breaks.                                                                                                                               |
| 42:47      | And you're doing [[AppleScript]] at that point.                                                                                                                          |
| 42:50      | That's the beauty of this.                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:52      | I learned all this [[AppleScript]] from Sal.                                                                                                                             |
| 42:54      | I don't think I've written a few of any scripts from scratch by myself or I just started line                                                                            |
| 43:02      | one with a blank cursor because so much of the stuff is out there.                                                                                                       |
| 43:05      | You can download it and start modifying it to make it work for you.                                                                                                      |
| 43:08      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:09      | You don't really need to sit down and learn all of these words and how it all works.                                                                                     |
| 43:13      | And obviously, it's a really powerful tool and if you're ready to get into the stuff                                                                                     |
| 43:18      | you can, but also, Sal's just given you everything that you can download and run it.                                                                                     |
| 43:22      | You don't need to necessarily understand it, obviously try to, but it's really useful                                                                                    |
| 43:27      | as it is.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 43:28      | If you go to [iWork Automation](http://iworkautomation.com), which is linked off of the macOS automation main page, it's                                                 |
| 43:36      | an entire site for just scripting the [[iWork]] suite of applications.                                                                                                   |
| 43:41      | And this script is actually part of the keynote section under it or under the numbers section.                                                                           |
| 43:49      | Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:50      | It's under the numbers section.                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:52      | There's on the right hand side, it says exporting to keynote.                                                                                                            |
| 43:57      | There's a couple examples there and they explain how the script works.                                                                                                   |
| 44:03      | So there's hundreds and hundreds of scripts available for you just dealing with iWork                                                                                    |
| 44:10      | on the iWork Automation website as well.                                                                                                                                 |
| 44:13      | And once you've used one of these, it's like David said, it's easy to understand what's                                                                                  |
| 44:20      | going on and use bits and pieces of things that you've seen or other people use or provided                                                                              |
| 44:26      | and put them together in creative ways to do what you want to do with the computer.                                                                                      |
| 44:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:33      | You know, we released this show on Friday for a reason because the goal is that our                                                                                      |
| 44:36      | listeners will spend the weekend kind of learning whatever new automation we talked about.                                                                               |
| 44:42      | If you go to this macOS automation.com site, I recommend having some vacation time stored                                                                                |
| 44:47      | up because it is a rabbit hole.                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:50      | There's so much great stuff.                                                                                                                                             |
| 44:52      | If you want to automate your photos application, I mean, honestly, a lot of this stuff is going                                                                          |
| 44:56      | to be future content for our show.                                                                                                                                       |
| 44:57      | We're going to talk about some of these automations, but there's so much stuff here that Sal has                                                                         |
| 45:02      | put together at [macosxautomation.com](https://macosxautomation.com) and just go take a look and I'm sure you're going to                                                |
| 45:06      | find something you would like to play with.                                                                                                                              |
| 45:09      | And because it's all there, you can download it, you can go ahead and break it and then                                                                                  |
| 45:14      | fix it.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:15      | And before you know it, you're programming and that's the beauty of this stuff.                                                                                          |
| 45:19      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:20      | And if anybody makes any tweaks to the original AppleScript to make it work for them, please                                                                             |
| 45:25      | post it in the forum so that everybody else can steal it because this is an amazing way                                                                                  |
| 45:30      | to get started.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 45:32      | So please, please share what tweaks you make to make it yours.                                                                                                           |
| 45:36      | To borrow a great idea that Apple has of everybody can code.                                                                                                             |
| 45:41      | Well, I think we can even go a step before that.                                                                                                                         |
| 45:45      | Everybody can script.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:46      | You know, it's coding and it uses the same kind of concepts of understanding objects                                                                                     |
| 45:52      | and it uses the same ideas about repeating and extracting and manipulating and empowering.                                                                               |
| 46:02      | And scripting is a great way to get yourself into the idea of that the power of the computer                                                                             |
| 46:10      | should reside in the hands of the one using it, that this is there for you.                                                                                              |
| 46:16      | This is built into this computer.                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:19      | It's built into the Apple software.                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:21      | It's built into third party software and it's waiting for you to just spend a little bit                                                                                 |
| 46:28      | of time to take advantage of it.                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:30      | Yeah, we were talking before we start recording how it feels like there's a little bit of                                                                                |
| 46:35      | a wave building on automation between Siri shortcuts and things going on.                                                                                                |
| 46:39      | And honestly, we started developing the show months before any of that stuff got announced.                                                                              |
| 46:43      | So we just got lucky, I guess.                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:45      | But how do you see, Sal, as someone who's so knowledgeable about [[AppleScript]] and [[JavaScript]]                                                                      |
| 46:52      | and worked for Apple for so long, how do you see all this fitting together with the Siri                                                                                 |
| 46:58      | shortcuts and the stuff that Apple is now bringing to the forefront?                                                                                                     |
| 47:04      | Automation is a fundamental thing about computers and not only computers, but just humans.                                                                               |
| 47:11      | As humans, we've always looked for ways to automate what we do.                                                                                                          |
| 47:16      | It's just a natural instinct.                                                                                                                                            |
| 47:19      | It's what makes us human.                                                                                                                                                |
| 47:22      | It's what makes us creative.                                                                                                                                             |
| 47:23      | It's what inspires us.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 47:26      | And so that's never going to go away from the computer.                                                                                                                  |
| 47:30      | And it's one of the things that attracts us to Macs is that it's always been a device                                                                                    |
| 47:35      | that allows us to explore and create with our own tool sets that we make ourselves.                                                                                      |
| 47:43      | And one of the interesting things that's happening is that this world is coming to iOS too, with                                                                         |
| 47:50      | groups like software developers like the Omni Group, who have implemented core [[JavaScript]]                                                                            |
| 47:59      | as a scripting language for their applications like [[OmniGraffle]] and [[OmniOutliner]] on iOS, you're                                                                  |
| 48:06      | starting to see the same kind of creative pallet that you had on the Mac.                                                                                                |
| 48:13      | You're starting to see that happen on iOS, and then you have applications like [[Drafts]]                                                                                |
| 48:20      | or 1Writer that support core [[JavaScript]] as well and expose their apps and functionality                                                                              |
| 48:29      | and a lot of these apps are now using URLs as a communication path instead of Apple events.                                                                              |
| 48:40      | They're using URLs because that's what's available currently on iOS.                                                                                                     |
| 48:46      | And I think that what you're seeing in the sense of the wave building, your instincts                                                                                    |
| 48:52      | are right on, David and Rose, your instincts are right on is you're sensing that there's                                                                                 |
| 48:57      | a wave happening and I really believe it is because that same ability is coming to that                                                                                  |
| 49:04      | platform and it's also being shared across both platforms.                                                                                                               |
| 49:09      | What Omni has done is they've implemented an automation solution through Omni Automation                                                                                 |
| 49:16      | that works both on Macs and iOS exactly the same way.                                                                                                                    |
| 49:21      | You write the same script that runs on both platforms the same.                                                                                                          |
| 49:26      | And I think that that's the beginning of a new wave of automation, a new wave of user                                                                                    |
| 49:32      | empowerment, and I think that's coming.                                                                                                                                  |
| 49:35      | And it's really important for Apple to be part of that as well.                                                                                                          |
| 49:42      | I think that Apple wants to grow their platform, especially in the enterprise and education                                                                              |
| 49:49      | markets, and I'll bet you as more automation comes to iOS that you're going to see an increase                                                                           |
| 49:55      | in sales in the enterprise because all of a sudden now you can make that device yours.                                                                                   |
| 50:02      | You can create a set of tools that your team or your staff use that solve those problems                                                                                 |
| 50:09      | and freeze them from drudgery and allows them to be as productive as they can be for you.                                                                                |
| 50:17      | And I think that Apple senses that too as well.                                                                                                                          |
| 50:21      | I'm looking at the changes that they made in Mojave and I'm looking at what they're                                                                                      |
| 50:26      | doing with iOS 12 and Siri shortcuts and I'm going, mm-hmm, it's part of it.                                                                                             |
| 50:33      | They're embracing this and I bet you it's going to reward Apple with increased sales,                                                                                    |
| 50:39      | increased loyalty, increased excitement about their products again.                                                                                                      |
| 50:44      | And once you get that excitement going, it's infectious.                                                                                                                 |
| 50:48      | Apple love to share the tools that they've created.                                                                                                                      |
| 50:51      | They love to make productivity things and then share that with their team or share that                                                                                  |
| 50:57      | with other individuals.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:59      | And Rose, you're a great example of that.                                                                                                                                |
| 51:02      | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 51:03      | Yes, it's really exciting.                                                                                                                                               |
| 51:04      | I was watching the keynote and I was like, they mentioned [[Automator]] on stage.                                                                                        |
| 51:09      | Are you kidding me?                                                                                                                                                      |
| 51:10      | They mentioned [[Automator]] on stage and yeah, I was there freaking out a little bit and                                                                                |
| 51:15      | a couple of people at [[AltConf]] were looking at me like I was a bit crazy.                                                                                             |
| 51:19      | It's like, no, it's fine.                                                                                                                                                |
| 51:20      | Seriously, this is good stuff.                                                                                                                                           |
| 51:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:22      | I'm like, [[Automator]], [[Automator]], you could use [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                   |
| 51:24      | It's like, yes, but [[Automator]] is a very good starting point.                                                                                                         |
| 51:27      | I can tell you that [[Automator]] and [[AppleScript]] have been part of every Apple keynote.                                                                             |
| 51:34      | They run in the background.                                                                                                                                              |
| 51:37      | When all of a sudden an email comes in from Tim or something, that just doesn't happen                                                                                   |
| 51:41      | by magic.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 51:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:43      | Or when all of a sudden, Craig walks up to the machine and it's perfectly set up for                                                                                     |
| 51:49      | this particular demo, there's a reason behind that.                                                                                                                      |
| 51:54      | And Apple uses automation to a high degree like any other large company.                                                                                                 |
| 52:00      | I mean, 80% of top tier companies that have a lot of computers use automation, they rely                                                                                 |

| 52:09      | You can't make charts by hand.                                                                                                                                           |
| 52:11      | You have to automate that process.                                                                                                                                       |
| 52:13      | You can't produce content by hand, especially if you're doing huge websites with lots of                                                                                 |
| 52:20      | images and media materials.                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:22      | That's got to be automated.                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:24      | It's the only way to, through automation, you get speed, accuracy, consistent output                                                                                     |
| 52:30      | and scalability.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 52:31      | And there's no other way to do that besides just throw bodies at something.                                                                                              |
| 52:37      | And then you're dealing with the normal problems of dealing with humans.                                                                                                 |
| 52:43      | And you're not using them to their best potential and you burn people out.                                                                                               |
| 52:47      | And that's not what you want to be about as an organisation.                                                                                                             |
| 52:50      | You want to be an organisation that leads and inspires.                                                                                                                  |
| 52:54      | And automation plays a big role in that.                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:57      | And if there's a mission statement for this podcast, it's that you don't need to be a                                                                                    |
| 53:01      | big company to take advantage of that.                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:03      | These tools are easy enough that anybody can do it.                                                                                                                      |
| 53:06      | I've got to feel like I just hit you guys over the head with a Nerf bat, right?                                                                                          |
| 53:11      | Definitely, yes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:14      | Anybody can get started.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:15      | And even if your organisation or a company that you work for is not necessarily thinking                                                                                 |
| 53:20      | it in terms of automation yet, just do it yourself.                                                                                                                      |
| 53:23      | That's something, you know, I do it at work.                                                                                                                             |
| 53:25      | That's my job.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:26      | My job is to automate things so that we don't have people sitting there copying things from                                                                              |
| 53:29      | spreadsheets into programs anymore.                                                                                                                                      |
| 53:31      | They just type it straight into the program.                                                                                                                             |
| 53:34      | And, you know, it makes life easier and you'd be surprised at how quickly people get on                                                                                  |
| 53:38      | board when they see, oh, right.                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:40      | So that table that you have to create every week in numbers, you can just snap your fingers.                                                                             |
| 53:45      | And in the time it's taking you to snap your fingers, that script is run and boom, you've                                                                                |
| 53:48      | got a fancy looking chart and keynote ready to go.                                                                                                                       |
| 53:52      | That's the sort of thing that gets people on board.                                                                                                                      |
| 53:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 53:57      | to be Apple to take advantage of this stuff.                                                                                                                             |
| 54:00      | It's easy enough and it's fast enough that anybody can do it, whether you're a one-person                                                                                |

| 54:11      | or whatever.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 54:12      | And we really want you to take that out of this show that you can do this stuff.                                                                                         |
| 54:16      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 54:17      | So, you know, one way you could get better at doing this stuff is going and taking a three-day                                                                           |
| 54:21      | course on AppleScript.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 54:23      | And there just happens to be one in October.                                                                                                                             |
| 54:27      | The [[Command D Down Home Scripting Bootcamp]], where you get taught by the master, Sal will                                                                             |
| 54:32      | be there teaching you for three days about how to get better at AppleScript.                                                                                             |
| 54:35      | And, you know, I think back to those two days I spent with you at Mackerel, I really think                                                                               |
| 54:42      | it was a huge step for me in my automation journey.                                                                                                                      |
| 54:45      | And I hope anybody that's interested in this stuff goes and checks it out.                                                                                               |
| 54:48      | And we even have a discount code.                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:50      | Yes, yes we do.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 54:52      | But you're going to have to do a little bit of coding to figure out the discount code,                                                                                   |
| 54:56      | aren't you, David?                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:57      | Yeah, we decided to make the code, Sal asked us, well, what do you want the code to be?                                                                                  |
| 55:01      | We said, well, let's make people write their first line of [[AppleScript]] to get $200 off.                                                                              |
| 55:06      | So Rose, what's the code?                                                                                                                                                |
| 55:07      | My code is very, very simple.                                                                                                                                            |
| 55:09      | It's `tellappdiscount`, all one word, small letters, lowercase.                                                                                                          |
| 55:14      | syntax isn't quite right, but yeah, that's what we can use, so `tellappdiscount`.                                                                                        |
| 55:20      | Yeah, so you don't need to write us and tell us we're missing the quote marks or spaces.                                                                                 |
| 55:25      | We understand.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 55:26      | But just be quiet and get your $200, just, you know.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:33      | Definitely, yes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:34      | I wanted to mention that.                                                                                                                                                |
| 55:35      | I'll be teaching this with Ray Robertson, who's an absolute master of [[AppleScript]] instruction.                                                                       |
| 55:42      | He is just the most patient and personable guy, and he knows scripting inside and out,                                                                                   |
| 55:50      | and it's just a joy to work with him.                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:53      | So we'll both be there, plenty of hands-on attention, and it's down home because it's                                                                                    |
| 55:59      | in Cartersville, Georgia, and where we can go to partake in some southern hospitality,                                                                                   |
| 56:05      | and I'm really looking forward to that.                                                                                                                                  |
| 56:07      | Yes, I'm sure it's going to be absolutely fabulous.                                                                                                                      |
| 56:10      | And of course, if you go to this, you'll get to hang out with a bunch of other people who                                                                                |
| 56:13      | are also interested in automation and trade ideas with them and borrow them and expand                                                                                   |
| 56:18      | them and make them your own, which is one of the massive advantages of going to these                                                                                    |
| 56:21      | things in person.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 56:23      | You really get to feed all the ideas in together.                                                                                                                        |
| 56:26      | Yeah, I saw Ray was teaching us some [[AppleScript]] last year at [[Command D]]. He made an                                                                              |
| 56:32      | analog clock with [[AppleScript]].                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:34      | To this day, I have no idea how he did it.                                                                                                                               |
| 56:37      | The guy really knows his stuff.                                                                                                                                          |
| 56:41      | I think it was using [[Adobe Illustrator\|Illustrator]] or something, right?                                                                                              |
| 56:44      | Yeah, it was.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:45      | It was using [[Adobe Illustrator\|Illustrator]].                                                                                                                          |
| 56:46      | It had a second hand that was sweeping.                                                                                                                                  |
| 56:50      | Crazy.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:51      | It's pretty amazing.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 56:52      | It would definitely go crazy.                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:54      | We promised our audience like 45 minutes, but we have you on the show, so of course                                                                                      |
| 56:58      | we're going to go over a little bit, but I want to ask you one last question.                                                                                            |
| 57:03      | What was your first automation?                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:04      | I mean, you're the master of this stuff, but you started somewhere.                                                                                                      |
| 57:07      | What is it that got you on this path?                                                                                                                                    |
| 57:12      | I was working in a print service bureau in Charlottesville, Virginia, and in the early                                                                                   |
| 57:18      | day, it was the early days of desktop publishing.                                                                                                                        |
| 57:24      | We had a Lineatronic 100, something like that, and we were getting hundreds and hundreds                                                                                 |
| 57:29      | of files coming through the door every day.                                                                                                                              |
| 57:32      | I had to go through manually these [[PageMaker]] and [[QuarkXPress]] files and make sure did they                                                                        |
| 57:38      | put the image to this, is this set for that, did they put a background on that, is the                                                                                   |
| 57:43      | font set for that.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:46      | Finally I was looking for ways to automate just checking and flight checking documents.                                                                                  |
| 57:54      | Simple things like that, it's something that could save me from 45 minutes of sending a                                                                                  |
| 58:00      | file to print and then finding out that wrong font type or image didn't have its background                                                                              |
| 58:05      | set.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 58:06      | I was looking for ways to automate that process, and I had been working with various developers                                                                          |
| 58:13      | at [[QuarkXTensions]], and that was quite useful.                                                                                                                        |
| 58:16      | We developed a couple things, one of which was [[ShadowCaster]] that did drop shadows on                                                                                 |

| 58:23      | It was like the first time that was done, but then I saw an ad in the Apple Developer                                                                                    |

| 58:40      | I bought the CD and I spent, I think, $10 or $14 on the [[Scriptable Finder]].                                                                                           |
| 58:48      | You had to buy a [[Scriptable Finder]] that came on a 400K floppy.                                                                                                       |
| 58:53      | At the time [[QuarkXPress]] was scriptable.                                                                                                                              |
| 58:56      | Dave Shaver and Ralph Rich had gotten Tim Gill to put scripting into [[Quark]], and [[Quark]]                                                                            |
| 59:04      | had this extensive scripting library, and I said, oh, this is fantastic.                                                                                                 |
| 59:09      | Let me try this out.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 59:11      | It's like David said, I looked at it and I looked at the dictionary and I said, okay,                                                                                    |
| 59:17      | there's an object and there's a property.                                                                                                                                |
| 59:21      | It says I should use the verb set and I should be able to just tell it.                                                                                                  |
| 59:26      | The first script that I ever wrote that got me started was set the colour of the current                                                                                 |
| 59:32      | box to blue.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 59:35      | Once I ran that and I watched that box in [[QuarkXPress]] turned blue, I just said, oh,                                                                                  |
| 59:43      | this is it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 59:44      | I don't need to go to somebody and say, please write me code to do this.                                                                                                 |
| 59:50      | I can do this myself.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 59:52      | I can create my own tools and I promptly fired all my clients.                                                                                                           |
| 59:57      | I had a design business.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 59:59      | I got rid of all my clients and I spent 13 hours a day in a room just sitting there                                                                                      |
| 01:00:05   | for months trying to learn and understand and absorb [[AppleScript]] and once I got my head                                                                              |
| 01:00:12   | around it, I started writing scripts professionally for big companies like AT&T and Better Homes                                                                         |
| 01:00:20   | and Gardens.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:21   | I wrote a fraction making script for their recipes.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:00:26   | I wrote scripts for everybody from Showtime to hundreds of big name companies and it's                                                                                   |
| 01:00:36   | a common thing.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:37   | Everybody needs automation and I got into the desktop publishing with the local real estate                                                                              |
| 01:00:43   | magazine and I created catalogue publishing scripts for that that eventually Apple saw                                                                                   |
| 01:00:50   | me and convinced me through much trickery, they convinced me to join the company and                                                                                     |
| 01:00:57   | once I did it, it just took off and accelerated but that's how I got started, just one line                                                                              |
| 01:01:04   | of code.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:05   | That's all it takes.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:06   | Got to get hooked somewhere.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:01:08   | You made it so much easier for the rest of us with all the stuff you've done over the                                                                                    |
| 01:01:10   | years so we certainly thank you for that and I'm really excited.                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:14   | The third episode of this new show, we're able to get a kind of intensive [[AppleScript]]                                                                                |
| 01:01:18   | tutorial from the man himself so I'll say go ahead and thank you so much and do download                                                                                 |
| 01:01:24   | that script, play with it, let us know in the forums how you're using it and like I                                                                                      |

| 01:01:35   | Sal, you're also speaking at a couple of places.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:37   | I guess you're at the [[Mac Sysadmin Conference]], correct?                                                                                                              |
| 01:01:40   | Yes, I'm at [[Mac Sysadmin Conference\|Mac Sysadmin]] this year in Gothenburg, Sweden in October and I'm speaking with my                                                |
| 01:01:48   | friends down at [[MacTech]] in November.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:53   | Always love going to visit with those guys, Neil and everybody, they're so nice and the                                                                                  |
| 01:01:59   | food is outstanding.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:02   | I just love the food there.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:02:04   | That's in LA, right?                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:05   | It's in LA and it's really convenient to get to and it's always fun and like you said,                                                                                   |
| 01:02:11   | I enjoy being around people who are into automation, who are looking for creative ways to use it.                                                                        |
| 01:02:22   | That's what Rose mentioned was that when you're around those kind of people, it's infectious                                                                             |
| 01:02:26   | and you start creating things and coming up with solutions that take you way beyond the                                                                                  |
| 01:02:32   | initial ideas that you had.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:02:34   | Well, thank you so much, Sal.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:36   | This certainly will not be the last time you're invited on the show.                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:38   | I hope we have you on many times in the future to talk about automation as we continue this                                                                              |

| 01:02:54   | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:55   | Yes, you did.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:56   | Again, I'm @macsparky.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:57   | Sal, you can find over at [macosxautomation.com](https://macosxautomation.com).                                                                                          |
| 01:03:00   | Is there any other websites we should point people at, Sal?                                                                                                              |

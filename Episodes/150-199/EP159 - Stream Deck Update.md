| 00:00      | Welcome the Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                    |
| 00:07      | And this is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.                                                                                |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:12      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                                                                                |
| 00:14      | Good.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:15      | I have been looking forward to this one.                                                                                                                                |
| 00:18      | We've mentioned on the show in the past that Elgato has been up to their usual tricks with                                                                              |
| 00:23      | the [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:24      | And we thought that was a good excuse to do an episode catching up on [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                  |
| 00:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:32      | I mean, it's one of those things where we do love our [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] and I use mine every                                                                |
| 00:38      | single day without really thinking about it.                                                                                                                            |
| 00:40      | I was actually just screen sharing at work earlier today and somebody said, oh, okay,                                                                                   |
| 00:45      | can you take a quick look at this story for me?                                                                                                                         |
| 00:47      | So stories are sort of our sub projects, I guess.                                                                                                                       |
| 00:51      | And I was like, sure, what's the number?                                                                                                                                |
| 00:54      | And I hit the button on my [[Stream Deck]] and a little macro run by [[Keyboard Maestro]] popped                                                                        |
| 00:58      | up a little input on my screen.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00      | And so as the person said, the number, like 1234, I typed it in and hit *Enter* and it opened                                                                           |
| 01:05      | the web page for me.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07      | And they were like, hang on a second, what just happened?                                                                                                               |
| 01:11      | Because I've made it really easy for myself to do things like open particular stories                                                                                   |
| 01:15      | at work or go to certain systems, which I need to do in certain browsers, and if I need                                                                                 |
| 01:22      | to remote desktop into one thing, then I actually have to open a terminal first and stuff like                                                                          |
| 01:26      | that.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:27      | So for all of those things, I've created macros and for things that I don't necessarily need                                                                            |
| 01:33      | super regularly, so I don't need them as a keyboard shortcut, they're on my [[Stream Deck]]                                                                             |
| 01:37      | right in front of me with a pretty little icon to make it really easy to just reach out                                                                                 |
| 01:41      | and press the picture and then the magic happens.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:44      | And for people who are not familiar with the [[Stream Deck]], this is such an automator friendly                                                                        |
| 01:49      | tool.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:50      | It's a piece of hardware made by [[Elgato]] that's a control surface.                                                                                                   |
| 01:54      | It's got a bunch of buttons on it, and then there's a screen behind it, and then the screen                                                                             |
| 01:59      | can give custom backgrounds to each of the buttons.                                                                                                                     |
| 02:03      | And as automators, we can do a bunch of things with it.                                                                                                                 |
| 02:06      | We're going to get into the software and the hardware here in a minute, but just the general                                                                            |
| 02:10      | idea is it's a control service near your Mac or your PC, and you can push a button and                                                                                  |
| 02:16      | make things happen.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 02:18      | And I understand that there's lots of ways to assign keyboard shortcuts, but the [[Stream Deck]],                                                                       |
| 02:22      | as someone who loves keyboard shortcuts, I can tell you the [[Stream Deck]] really is                                                                                   |
| 02:27      | useful because it's always there, and like I said, we're going to go through our uses                                                                                   |
| 02:32      | and what we're doing with them, but I guess that's enough of a basic explanation.                                                                                       |
| 02:37      | It's called the [[Stream Deck]] because they started it as a product for streamers, like                                                                                |

| 02:55      | I think the name feels a little antiquated, honestly, at this point, but we love our [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]].                                                     |
| 03:02      | Rose and I have multiple.                                                                                                                                               |
| 03:03      | I thought maybe we'd start by just checking in on the body count.                                                                                                       |

| 03:11      | Okay, so I've got my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]], [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]],                                                        |

| 03:23      | At what point do we start admitting that we have a problem?                                                                                                             |
| 03:26      | I have fewer [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] than you, I am sure of that.                                                                                                 |
| 03:28      | How many do you have, David?                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:30      | No, I also have five, but the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]] is the big one.                                                                                        |
| 03:38      | It's got 32 buttons on it and a grid of four by eight.                                                                                                                  |
| 03:42      | I got one of those, and then we were on the show talking about it at some point, and I                                                                                  |

| 03:49      | [Somebody on Etsy created a custom 3D printed bracket](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1148121754/dual-stream-deck-xl-stand-2-versions)                                 |

| 03:58      | After I made fun of owning two of them, one of the users wrote me and said, Challenge                                                                                   |

| 04:03      | He had one that he wasn't using any longer.                                                                                                                             |
| 04:05      | He sold it to me, and now I have two of the big [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL's]].                                                                                   |
| 04:10      | Then a year or two ago, they came out with the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]], which is only eight                                                          |
| 04:16      | buttons, but it also has four dials.                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:19      | That's useful.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:20      | Add touchscreens above them as well.                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:22      | We're going to talk about all this as we go through it, but just to index the body count.                                                                               |
| 04:28      | They came out with a new one called the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Stream Deck Neo]], which is what led to this show.                                               |
| 04:33      | It's more of a consumer-friendly one.                                                                                                                                   |
| 04:34      | It's eight buttons, but it's got some very clever features.                                                                                                             |
| 04:38      | It puts the date and time on it.                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:40      | It allows you to scroll through multiple setups without using a whole button as well, which                                                                             |
| 04:45      | is really nice.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 04:46      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:47      | Then they also have [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|a pedal]].                                                                                                         |

| 04:57      | automations with your foot.                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:00      | If you do things like podcasting, that could be pretty useful.                                                                                                          |
| 05:03      | Even if you're not podcasting, if anybody's not seen it, if you go to a concert and there's                                                                             |
| 05:08      | a guitarist with an electric guitar, they've probably got a foot pedal there that they                                                                                  |
| 05:13      | walk over to and they hit at various points to do various things on their guitar.                                                                                       |
| 05:17      | This is in addition to the switches and flips and so on on their guitar.                                                                                                |
| 05:21      | If you think of piano pedals, as you hold a piano pedal, that changes the sound of how                                                                                  |

| 05:27      | Well, a [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]] is very much a similar concept in that it's only three pedals,                                                                |
| 05:33      | but that's quite good because I can easily distinguish between those three with my feet,                                                                                |
| 05:37      | because the middle one is... I was really silly last week.                                                                                                              |
| 05:41      | I was wearing sneakers, David.                                                                                                                                          |

| 05:48      | I'm currently wearing slippers with really thick soles to cushion my feet to make sure                                                                                  |
| 05:51      | I don't do any more damage to my feet.                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:54      | Through those very thick soles, I can still feel the difference between that wider middle                                                                               |

| 06:09      | I use this for all sorts of things, muting myself in various applications.                                                                                              |
| 06:14      | As I'm having meetings at work or as we're recording, I can hit the button and it inserts                                                                               |
| 06:19      | a timestamp into the show notes and then it pops up a little thing for me to say, hey,                                                                                  |
| 06:24      | what sort of timestamp do you want to input to give me a little hand if it's like a chapter                                                                             |
| 06:28      | marker or a cough mark or something so that we can pass that on to our editor?                                                                                          |
| 06:32      | I honestly think the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]], despite it only being three buttons, is underrated.                                                             |
| 06:39      | It's a very sneaky little... It's not super visible, but it just means that you've got                                                                                  |
| 06:45      | your feet there anyway, right?                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:47      | You can just press a button and then the thing happens without you really needing to move                                                                               |
| 06:51      | the rest of your body, and especially if you've got one foot resting on it already, that's                                                                              |
| 06:55      | very handy.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:56      | Yeah, I'm not sure I agree with [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|the pedal]] to me.                                                                                     |
| 07:00      | That's the least used device because it is just three buttons, but I do have it rigged                                                                                  |
| 07:06      | when I'm on a [[Zoom]] call to be able to hide the camera, mute the audio, things like that,                                                                            |
| 07:12      | and it makes sense for that.                                                                                                                                            |
| 07:14      | Historically, I had used it with my Elgato microphone capture device because all the [[Elgato]]                                                                         |
| 07:22      | stuff works together so easily as a mute button, but then that device stopped working.                                                                                  |
| 07:27      | In fact, today on Automator's Max, we're going to talk about other [[Elgato]] gear we own.                                                                              |
| 07:32      | It was useful for that, but I've got to tell you, I feel like I'm underutilising the pedal.                                                                             |
| 07:38      | There's part of me that feels like, well, I should be able to... Maybe I turn the centre                                                                                |
| 07:43      | one into new task in [[OmniFocus]] or something, but it never really sticks for me.                                                                                     |
| 07:49      | It clearly is useful for online meeting stuff, but I haven't been able to really get it to                                                                              |
| 07:56      | stick for any other use, honestly.                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:00      | Just looking through.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:02      | One of the ways the [[Stream Deck]] works is you can make various setups.                                                                                               |
| 08:06      | You could say, if you're in a certain application, make it do this or that.                                                                                             |
| 08:11      | I've been setting it up lately because I make a lot of [[Zoom]] videos for my team, and I've                                                                            |
| 08:17      | got it set up so when I open the [[Zoom]], I can trigger things.                                                                                                        |
| 08:19      | I open [[Zoom]] and [[ScreenFlow]].                                                                                                                                     |
| 08:22      | The recording style apps, I find it useful for, but I just can't really get it to work                                                                                  |
| 08:27      | for me in general.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:29      | Well, I guess we will need to talk about that then, David, because I feel like for me, it's                                                                             |
| 08:34      | an incredibly useful application or tool to help with what I'm currently doing with my...                                                                               |
| 08:43      | What is the right word for it?                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:46      | Context?                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:47      | I guess, yeah.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:48      | One of the ways that I decide what my pedals should be doing is based on what I'm currently                                                                             |
| 08:54      | doing through my setup that I've currently set up through [[Bunch]] or similar.                                                                                         |
| 09:00      | That will help me then decide or that dictates what the pedal does at any moment in time,                                                                               |
| 09:06      | because when I've set it up to say that I'm podcasting, then I pop it into podcasting                                                                                   |
| 09:10      | mode and it does one thing with inserting stuff into the show notes or just activating                                                                                  |
| 09:14      | the show notes or activating [[Zoom]].                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:17      | If I switch to a meeting, then it toggles it to being for mute, bringing up the meeting                                                                                 |
| 09:23      | window again, and then opening drafts, because that's where I write my notes.                                                                                           |
| 09:27      | When I'm doing my programming, then different buttons will open my IDE or they will open                                                                                |
| 09:34      | my browser because I'm a web developer, so I'm often switching between those two or                                                                                     |
| 09:38      | the [[Terminal]], because that's what I need.                                                                                                                           |
| 09:40      | I tend to just have it activate applications or do one simple function, most likely as                                                                                  |
| 09:46      | a toggle, but I also have it set up so that I have a button on my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]] that                                                   |
| 09:56      | I can easily see that shows me or which lets me set the profile of my pedal, so it's actually                                                                           |
| 10:04      | a folder and then when I press on the folder, it allows me to say, okay, I want podcasting                                                                              |
| 10:09      | mode or I want iOS today mode because that does things so differently or I want my work                                                                                 |
| 10:14      | mode and things like that.                                                                                                                                              |
| 10:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10:16      | I've done the same setup in terms of how I switch modes on it, but like I said, I just                                                                                  |
| 10:22      | find in general, I find myself more likely to go push a button on a [[Stream Deck]] or use                                                                              |
| 10:28      | a keyboard shortcut than use the pedal, except for those kind of video style items, and I                                                                               |
| 10:34      | don't know why.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10:35      | I just can't seem to get myself into the mode of using it day to day for other things like                                                                              |
| 10:41      | launching an app or things like that, so I'm aware of it.                                                                                                               |
| 10:44      | I'm trying to explore other ways to use it.                                                                                                                             |
| 10:49      | I was thinking the other day, maybe I use it as a dedicated music control because I listen                                                                              |
| 10:55      | to music all throughout the day and I could have pause play previous and forward just                                                                                   |
| 11:01      | as I'm sitting through the day, but at the same time, I've got an [[Apple]] keyboard and                                                                                |
| 11:05      | I've got those controls literally a half inch from my finger, and I think I can probably                                                                                |
| 11:11      | get to the control on the keyboard faster than I can get my foot on the pedal.                                                                                          |
| 11:16      | That's where I run into the block on the pedal, but yeah, I guess we are now officially                                                                                 |
| 11:22      | talking about the pedal.                                                                                                                                                |
| 11:24      | It's been out for a couple years, and like I said, I am struggling to find uses for it                                                                                  |
| 11:29      | beyond video and meeting, but for the stuff I do use it for, I find it quite useful.                                                                                    |
| 11:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11:35      | I mean, for me, I found it to be indispensable, but it is primarily when combined with another                                                                          |
| 11:43      | device because the problem with the pedal is, unlike the stream deck, there is no screen                                                                                |
| 11:48      | to tell me what that button is going to do.                                                                                                                             |
| 11:50      | I also have a desk in the way.                                                                                                                                          |
| 11:53      | My desk is not glass, it's solid wood, so I can't look through my desk at a picture                                                                                     |
| 11:58      | to see what it's going to do.                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:02      | I've worked on a couple of different options over time.                                                                                                                 |
| 12:07      | At the moment, I've just gone with there is a folder which shows me which profiles I                                                                                    |
| 12:13      | can choose, and then I just rely on having selected the right one, but one of the things                                                                                |
| 12:19      | that I have tried previously is the sort of switch type button that you can have in the                                                                                 |
| 12:27      | [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12:28      | It's not the one that's a multi-action.                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:30      | I think it is a switch where someone can have two states, and when you press it, it switches                                                                            |
| 12:37      | between them, but that only works if you only have two, because I like having the visual                                                                                |
| 12:44      | indicator of which profile I'm on, and that's the tricky part.                                                                                                          |
| 12:51      | Maybe I can do something.                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:52      | [[Timothy Luoma\|TJ Luoma]] created that awesome [[Apple Calendar\|Calendar]], a [[Keyboard Maestro]], [[Stream Deck]] combination.                                     |
| 12:59      | Maybe I can do something like that where when I set the [[Stream Deck]] profile, it also triggers                                                                       |
| 13:05      | a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that sets a particular button image for me so that I know what profile                                                                     |
| 13:12      | I'm currently on, because that could definitely be handy for a lot of people if they've got                                                                             |
| 13:17      | multiple profiles for the pedal.                                                                                                                                        |
| 13:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 13:20      | Well, I would argue that [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|the pedal]] is probably the most niche product of all of the [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]],                   |
| 13:24      | but it is, like I said, if you do stuff in front of a camera, you just stick it down                                                                                    |
| 13:29      | on your foot, and there you go.                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:32      | But can I get back to the primary [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] and talk about those, because I want to talk                                                            |
| 13:37      | about what I'm doing with my pair of excels.                                                                                                                            |
| 13:40      | I did, after I made fun of it, I did order [the stand off Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1148121754/dual-stream-deck-xl-stand-2-versions).                       |
| 13:45      | It's a 3D printed stand, very well-crafted, and it's got magnets embedded in it, so the                                                                                 |
| 13:50      | [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] fit on it perfectly with one on top and one on bottom.                                                                                    |
| 13:56      | They're both excels, so I've got 64 buttons on these two [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] combined, and they                                                               |
| 14:01      | sit under my monitor and right above my keyboard.                                                                                                                       |
| 14:05      | So that is a very convenient location, and that's really the primary control surface                                                                                    |
| 14:11      | of stream deck for me, even though I've got some others we can get into in a minute.                                                                                    |
| 14:15      | And the way I do it is the top one is static.                                                                                                                           |
| 14:19      | It has, the buttons are always the same, and if you never use a [[Stream Deck]], Rose was                                                                               |
| 14:23      | mentioning earlier, profiles, you can have different sets of buttons that show up, so                                                                                   |
| 14:28      | if you've got an answering email profile, it's got your email buttons, and then you've                                                                                  |
| 14:32      | got your managing task buttons, it's got your, it changes all the buttons out to managing                                                                               |
| 14:37      | task buttons, or whatever it is that you want to do with it.                                                                                                            |
| 14:41      | But I keep the top one static that doesn't have different profiles.                                                                                                     |
| 14:46      | It's got key stuff for me, like that's where I've got the [[Zoom]] mute controls.                                                                                       |
| 14:53      | That's where I can turn on the recording light outside my door.                                                                                                         |
| 14:56      | I've got a bunch of home control stuff.                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:58      | I can lock the front door here, sometimes I can, I'm working in the morning, my kids                                                                                    |
| 15:02      | will leave the house, my wife, she doesn't lock the door, I press a button, door will                                                                                   |
| 15:06      | lock.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:07      | The same thing, I can control the lights in the room.                                                                                                                   |
| 15:11      | And then I also have buttons that correspond to changing the profiles on the bottom one.                                                                                |
| 15:17      | And the bottom one for me really does change a lot.                                                                                                                     |
| 15:21      | Like right now, I'm on the podcasting one, and it's got buttons in front of me for, it's                                                                                |
| 15:26      | got like Rose's time zone, if this thing is right right now, Rose, it's 18:23 at your house.                                                                            |
| 15:33      | And I can save recordings, I can set up episodes, I can do [[Zoom]] controls, I can add timestamps.                                                                     |
| 15:42      | I've got a whole like series of buttons I've created over the years that give me everything                                                                             |
| 15:46      | I need to drive a podcast, and that those appear on the bottom set of [[Stream Deck]] buttons.                                                                          |
| 15:52      | But when I finish the show, maybe I'm going to go over to [[OmniFocus]], and [[OmniFocus]] will                                                                         |
| 15:57      | then take over control.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16:00      | It has the ability to automatically switch those profiles when you go into an app.                                                                                      |
| 16:03      | So like I've got a button series for OmniFocus, and if I do that, the bottom one will switch                                                                            |
| 16:09      | from podcasting to [[OmniFocus]], and I'll have all the various controls that I want out of                                                                             |
| 16:14      | OmniFocus.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16:15      | So, you can really do a lot with a pair of these things after I made fun of it.                                                                                         |
| 16:20      | Man, I don't think I'd give it up.                                                                                                                                      |
| 16:22      | Yeah, I do something similar with [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|the plus]].                                                                                               |
| 16:27      | So [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|the plus]] is mostly static and doesn't really change all that much, but it allows me to                                                 |
| 16:32      | do things like, you know, see and easily control the volume and so on.                                                                                                  |
| 16:36      | And one thing that is important to know about my setup is I have two machines on my desk.                                                                               |
| 16:44      | I have my laptop, my desktop, my Mac Studio, and so I'll do all of my podcasting and everything,                                                                        |
| 16:50      | you know, personal on my Mac Studio, but I also use my laptop for work.                                                                                                 |
| 16:53      | So it means that I can, you know, easily have both set up and then at lunchtime just, you                                                                               |
| 16:57      | know, swap over to the Mac Studio because switching users on macOS, especially if you're                                                                                |
| 17:03      | a developer and you're trying to run services and stuff, it gets a little bit hairy at times.                                                                           |
| 17:06      | So I just switch machines if I need to do a little podcast for lunchtime.                                                                                               |
| 17:10      | And that means that my Mac Studio is always ready to go.                                                                                                                |
| 17:14      | But as part of this, I switch my keyboard and mouse and [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]] and [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]]                            |
| 17:21      | between my two machines.                                                                                                                                                |
| 17:25      | I use, it's actually a USB switch.                                                                                                                                      |
| 17:28      | It's sort of similar to a [[KVM Switch\|KVM]] for anybody familiar with those.                                                                                          |
| 17:32      | But basically I have, you know, a button on my desk with, it's actually got four buttons                                                                                |
| 17:37      | on it.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:38      | Like this four computers and one is my Mac Studio and two is my laptop.                                                                                                 |
| 17:44      | But when my Mac Studio is the one with the keyboard and, you know, mouse control, then                                                                                  |
| 17:53      | the Stream Deck Plus will be controlling the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]].                                                                            |
| 17:57      | If it's not, then, you know, the buttons that I have in that second row don't really do                                                                                 |
| 18:02      | a lot.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18:03      | But that's okay because, you know, my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]] has, you know, what 32 buttons on                                                  |
| 18:07      | it.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 18:08      | So, yeah, I can control my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]] from my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Plus]] a lot of the time when I'm using                   |
| 18:14      | my Mac Studio, which is great.                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:17      | And then I have the other buttons to just allow me to do whatever I need as I want.                                                                                     |
| 18:22      | Yeah, I'm really spoiled with this two [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]] setup.                                                                                        |
| 18:28      | I'm currently, like I've been playing with things, like there is a set of plugins for                                                                                   |
| 18:32      | the [[Stream Deck]] that will display like the current date, time and weather.                                                                                          |
| 18:37      | And I had those across the top row for the longest time, but I found that I never looked                                                                                |
| 18:42      | at them.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18:43      | You know, I want the time and date, I look at my screen.                                                                                                                |
| 18:47      | I don't look down at the [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                               |
| 18:49      | So I killed those off recently and now I've got four buttons here that I haven't used                                                                                   |
| 18:54      | yet, so I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do with those.                                                                                                        |
| 18:56      | But it's kind of an organic process if you get one of these.                                                                                                            |
| 19:00      | I want to take a little side note, though, on [[Stream Deck]] as we're doing this update.                                                                               |
| 19:07      | And we've mentioned this on the show in the past, but you can drive a [[Stream Deck]] with                                                                              |
| 19:11      | the built-in [[Elgato]] software, or you can use [[BetterTouchTool]], which can take over the                                                                           |
| 19:17      | [[Stream Deck]] entirely.                                                                                                                                               |
| 19:19      | And I was just wondering, where are you on that these days?                                                                                                             |
| 19:24      | So it depends on what machine I'm using, actually.                                                                                                                      |
| 19:28      | So on my laptop, I am using [[BetterTouchTool]] to control my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|Stream Deck XL]] or the                                                                     |
| 19:35      | [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck MK 2\|Stream Deck MK 2]] that I have as my on-the-go device, because, of course, I have a [[Stream Deck]]                                     |
| 19:41      | in my portable office bag.                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:43      | And yeah, so that's what I'm using there.                                                                                                                               |
| 19:46      | And then on my Mac Studio, I am using [[Elgato\|Elgato's]] software, just because I use [[Ecamm Live\|Ecamm]] a lot for                                                 |
| 19:55      | [[iOS Today]] and some other things as well, which allows me to do things like use my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]]                                                 |
| 20:00      | to pop up my iPhone on screen or to pop up my iPad on screen, or to switch back                                                                                         |
| 20:05      | to just a view of me.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 20:07      | And that's not something that's easy to do without support from [[Ecamm Live\|Ecamm]].                                                                                  |
| 20:13      | I'd have to hack around it with a click-it image or adding a bunch of keyboard shortcuts                                                                                |
| 20:18      | and then using [[Keyboard Maestro]] to trigger stuff.                                                                                                                   |
| 20:21      | So I decided that on my Mac Studio, I was going to stick with the [[Stream Deck]] software.                                                                             |
| 20:26      | But on my laptop, I am using [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                                                       |
| 20:29      | I have spent a lot of time experimenting with [[BetterTouchTool]], and I think in a lot of                                                                              |
| 20:34      | ways it's superior to the [[Elgato]] software.                                                                                                                          |
| 20:37      | [[Elgato]] software feels a little rickety to me, to be honest.                                                                                                         |
| 20:41      | But it's like Rose said, there's a bunch of features in the [[Elgato]] software that I don't                                                                            |
| 20:45      | get in [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                                                                             |
| 20:48      | And I just decided at this point, at least I'm sticking with the [[Elgato]] stuff, but I'm                                                                              |
| 20:53      | always keeping attention on [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                                                        |
| 20:57      | And in [[Elgato]], I call it rickety, but it works.                                                                                                                     |
| 21:00      | There's not a problem that when you press the buttons, everything happens, but just                                                                                     |
| 21:06      | occasionally oddities happen.                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:09      | Like yesterday, as I was actually working on the outline for the show, the top [[Stream Deck]]                                                                          |
| 21:13      | of my two [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XLs]] just went dark on me.                                                                                                     |
| 21:17      | And I don't know why.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:18      | So I rebooted the software, that didn't fix it, I unplugged it and plugged it back in,                                                                                  |
| 21:23      | that fixed it right away.                                                                                                                                               |
| 21:24      | I've never had that experience when I was running the [[BetterTouchTool]] software where                                                                                |
| 21:29      | I get sometimes oddities with the [[Elgato]] software.                                                                                                                  |
| 21:34      | But there's so many plugins for it, there's so many third parties that are in on it.                                                                                    |
| 21:38      | And Elgato is actively working on this.                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:40      | There's always updates.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:41      | It's not like it's kind of like the hardware/abandonware that you get with a lot                                                                                        |
| 21:47      | of stuff you plug into your computer.                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:50      | This is actively being developed.                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:52      | I mean, one thing that's changed over the years we've been talking about [[Stream Deck]]                                                                                |
| 21:55      | is they've turned it into [a store](https://marketplace.elgato.com/stream-deck) now where you can buy icon sets and additional features                                 |
| 22:02      | if you want.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22:03      | So they've got a lot of good reasons to want to make their software work.                                                                                               |
| 22:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 22:08      | And it's one of those things as well where they are working really hard on it.                                                                                          |
| 22:13      | And to that end, they've actually launched [the marketplace online](https://marketplace.elgato.com/stream-deck), which is, it's like                                    |
| 22:20      | an app store for your [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                  |
| 22:22      | So if you install some software, say, for example, [[Ecamm Live]] or [[Farrago]], which is from                                                                         |
| 22:28      | [[Audio Hijack]], not [[Audio Hijack]], [[Rogue Amoeba]], the folks who make [[Audio Hijack]], [[Paul Kafasis]]                                                         |
| 22:34      | as we had him on the last episode of the show, then those applications can prompt you to                                                                                |
| 22:41      | install a [[Stream Deck]] plugin.                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:44      | But in lieu of that, for everything else out there, because there's so many great options,                                                                              |
| 22:50      | then there is [an actual marketplace](https://marketplace.elgato.com/stream-deck) where you can go and you don't have to actually                                       |
| 22:55      | have a [[Stream Deck]] to go on to [the marketplace](https://marketplace.elgato.com/stream-deck) and look at what plugins there are for the                             |
| 23:01      | [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:02      | This is also not the only way to install [[Stream Deck]] plugins, icons, profiles.                                                                                      |
| 23:07      | There's even sound music and screen savers now, which is pretty cool.                                                                                                   |
| 23:11      | But it is quite a nice way to find some of the things that are possible with the [[Stream Deck]]                                                                        |
| 23:18      | So one of the things that is there is, for example, a [[Toggl Track\|Toggl]] plugin, which is created                                                                    |
| 23:24      | by Toby Mori.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:27      | He unfortunately isn't maintaining it, but it is open source, so it's been upgraded to                                                                                  |
| 23:32      | use the new [[Toggl Track\|Toggl]] API rather than the deprecated one.                                                                                                   |
| 23:35      | But it will show you your current timer on screen and how long it's been running for.                                                                                   |
| 23:39      | And just being able to have a look and see what's available, if you are going to look                                                                                   |
| 23:44      | at it, I do recommend, make sure if you're looking at plugins that you filter for macOS                                                                                 |
| 23:48      | ones, because otherwise, like me, every self-gyn you'll get very excited about something and                                                                            |
| 23:52      | then realise that it's a Windows-only one because it's using, you know, like [[PowerShell]][^1]                                                                         |
| 23:56      | or something.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:57      | And so you'd have to fork it and rewrite it to make it work on the Mac, which isn't                                                                                     |
| 24:02      | always possible.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 24:03      | But yeah, there's all sorts of great options, including some nice ones from [[Elgato]] themselves                                                                       |
| 24:09      | with support for [[Apple Mail]] and [[Apple Music]].                                                                                                                    |
| 24:14      | There's also one for [[Amphetamine]], so you can control one of the applications that will                                                                              |
| 24:18      | keep your Mac awake from your [[Stream Deck]] and things like that, all of which is pretty                                                                              |
| 24:23      | cool.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:24      | Yeah, like one of the ones that they have that I think is really well done is they've                                                                                   |
| 24:27      | got a [[Zoom]] profile and icon pack.                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:31      | So if you use [[Zoom]] a lot, you can just download some nicely formatted buttons, and it does                                                                          |
| 24:38      | a whole control surface, and it lets you pick which device you have.                                                                                                    |
| 24:41      | So like I have the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]], so it fills up all 32 buttons with various [[Zoom]] controls.                                                    |
| 24:46      | And I did that just as kind of a joke to see what it was like, because I'd already made                                                                                 |
| 24:50      | my own [[Zoom]] controls, but I actually found the one they made better than the one I had                                                                              |
| 24:53      | made, so I started using it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:56      | And yeah, you can go through there and get access to a lot of that.                                                                                                     |

| 27:16      | Okay, so Rose, I didn't finish my tour of hardware before in the earlier segment, so                                                                                    |
| 27:24      | I want to talk about the other two pieces I have.                                                                                                                       |
| 27:28      | The [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]] is the one I had mentioned.                                                                                              |
| 27:31      | It's got the dials, some basic control service and eight buttons.                                                                                                       |
| 27:36      | And that has really turned into media controls for me and desktop view controls.                                                                                        |
| 27:42      | So I've got the static buttons on there that runs [[Apple Music]], runs my white noise generator,                                                                       |
| 27:49      | but also does stuff like hide the dock, hide the desktop icons.                                                                                                         |
| 27:54      | And I'm doing all that with various software keyboard shortcuts.                                                                                                        |
| 27:57      | Like I'm using [[Cleanshot X\|CleanShot X's]] function to hide the desktop items.                                                                                       |
| 28:04      | And I just got that keyboard shortcut attached to a button.                                                                                                             |
| 28:07      | I've got, I think it's a terminal command or something I use to hide the dock.                                                                                          |
| 28:11      | Something I don't even remember how I set it up, but I push a button and the dock gets                                                                                  |
| 28:15      | hidden because I screencast a lot.                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:17      | I've got [[Change macOS Menu Bar Clock\|a terminal command that swaps the clock in the upper right corner between analog and digital]]                                  |
| 28:24      | because when I screencast, even though you think I've only been there 30                                                                                                |
| 28:29      | seconds, it might be 45 minutes because screencasting is hard.                                                                                                          |
| 28:33      | And I feel like the analog clock makes it less obvious.                                                                                                                 |
| 28:37      | I used to just not show a clock, but there's no way to do that now.                                                                                                     |
| 28:41      | But I made [[Change macOS Menu Bar Clock\|a little terminal that switches them out]] and I have a button for that.                                                      |
| 28:47      | So I use the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]] for that kind of stuff.                                                                                         |
| 28:50      | The dials I've got connected to two [[Stream Deck]] key lights so I can turn them on by pressing                                                                        |
| 28:58      | the dial and I can turn them up and down using the dial to make them more and less.                                                                                     |
| 29:03      | And then also on the wheel, the right wheel, I've got overall system volume and then the                                                                                |
| 29:09      | second from right wheel, I have dedicated to [[Apple Music]] volume.                                                                                                    |
| 29:14      | And that is a [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcut that is running a little [[AppleScript]] that just                                                                          |
| 29:21      | lowers the music volume.                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:23      | Nice.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:25      | One of my favourite things about my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]] is that I also gave me an excuse                                                         |
| 29:29      | to use my 3D printer.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:32      | And I printed a little shelf unit so it holds the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]] on a lower shelf and                                                       |
| 29:40      | my audio interface on the upper shelf, which got more room on my desk and just makes me                                                                                 |
| 29:46      | happy that I can 3D print things.                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:50      | I mean, 3D printers are excellent.                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:52      | Have you actually put any 3D printer controls on your [[Stream Deck]], David?                                                                                           |
| 29:57      | Because I do have one where I know my 3D printer is actually right behind me, but I do actually                                                                         |
| 30:04      | have a button that will allow me to open the camera stream for my 3D printer because I                                                                                  |
| 30:09      | have a little camera pointed at it so I can do time-lapse videos of things, which is always                                                                             |
| 30:15      | quite fun.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:16      | If you make a little gift for somebody being able to send them a little time-lapse video                                                                                |
| 30:18      | of it being printed as well, it's fun.                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:22      | But I tend to have that open, little corner of the screen somewhere out of the way while                                                                                |
| 30:27      | I'm working just because it means that I'm not constantly turning around and moving my                                                                                  |
| 30:31      | head away to actually see what's happening with my [[Stream Deck]] or with my 3D printer                                                                                    |
| 30:38      | thanks to the [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                          |
| 30:39      | And my printer's out in the woodshop, so that camera is actually even more useful for me,                                                                               |
| 30:43      | but I don't have it connected to a [[Stream Deck]] button.                                                                                                              |
| 30:48      | Maybe that's for [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|my foot pedal]].                                                                                                      |
| 30:50      | Give me a quick look what's going on in the garage.                                                                                                                     |
| 30:52      | But the plus is, I think for someone like me who does a lot of media stuff, it's really                                                                                 |
| 30:59      | useful to be able to set up lighting and camera rigs with those buttons.                                                                                                |
| 31:04      | And I think that [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Stream Deck+]] is ideal for that.                                                                                          |
| 31:07      | It does have, like you said, a control surface, which I almost never use.                                                                                               |
| 31:12      | And I feel like that could be better, honestly.                                                                                                                         |
| 31:18      | I feel like they learned from the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Plus]] when it came to making the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Neo]], because one of                    |
| 31:23      | the things with the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Mini\|Stream Deck Mini]], which neither David nor I have, because it's only                                               |
| 31:28      | got six buttons on it, but one of the things about that is the fact that they were aware                                                                                |
| 31:35      | that the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Mini\|Stream Deck Mini]] only has six buttons.                                                                                       |
| 31:38      | And especially if you want multiple pages, screens, or whatever, that means that you're                                                                                 |
| 31:44      | using at least one of those buttons at all times, if not two, which means you're down                                                                                   |
| 31:51      | to four.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31:52      | So with the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Stream Deck Neo]], which is the newest one, and their Neo range, by the way,                                                 |
| 31:57      | is eco-friendly.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31:59      | So they're using eco-friendly plastics.                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:01      | They've upgraded all their packaging to be eco-friendly, so it's all card, and so it's                                                                                  |
| 32:05      | biodegradable and so on, rather than plastics and things like that.                                                                                                     |
| 32:08      | But what they've done there is they have taken some of that sort of touchscreen element                                                                                 |
| 32:13      | from the plus, and they've put it as two buttons underneath those eight buttons with                                                                                    |
| 32:19      | that tiny little extra screen in the middle that can display things like the day and time                                                                               |
| 32:23      | or weather and things like that.                                                                                                                                        |
| 32:25      | So those two tiny little non-picture buttons at the bottom are for switching between profiles                                                                           |
| 32:32      | or pages and things like that.                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:33      | And I feel like that was a really good move there, because that for me works very nicely.                                                                               |
| 32:40      | And so I've been enjoying playing with that.                                                                                                                            |
| 32:42      | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:44      | And so that gets to the last one.                                                                                                                                       |
| 32:45      | I bought the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Neo]] just almost just to test it more than anything else.                                                                  |
| 32:49      | It's an eight-button one.                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:51      | It's got a time and date below.                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:54      | Again, I've had this thing on my desk a couple months now.                                                                                                              |
| 32:58      | I almost never look at the time and date on it, although I do find it useful when my screen                                                                             |
| 33:03      | is dark.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:04      | Like if I'm in the room and my screen is turned off or resting, I can at least see the time                                                                             |
| 33:09      | and date on the little [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Neo]].                                                                                                            |
| 33:12      | And it's got eight buttons.                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:14      | And I am currently the idea behind this one is I'm putting setups on it so I can push                                                                                   |
| 33:20      | a button on there and have it set up to record a podcast or record a screencast or process                                                                              |
| 33:25      | mail or whatever.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 33:28      | And that seems silly to me in some ways, because that is a very easy keyboard shortcut.                                                                                 |
| 33:32      | But the magic of the [[Stream Deck]], something to me is, are you just sit down, you push                                                                               |
| 33:37      | a button, and you start working?                                                                                                                                        |
| 33:39      | And I do find that to be beneficial, and I think the Neo is kind of perfect for that.                                                                                   |
| 33:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33:46      | It's also, it's not a huge amount more than the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Mini\|Stream Deck Mini]], but with those two extra buttons,                                   |
| 33:51      | that's not just two buttons.                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:53      | That is, what is it, 33% more button real estate?                                                                                                                       |
| 33:57      | But it's actually, it's more.                                                                                                                                           |
| 34:00      | It's 50% more buttons because of those two extra ones at the bottom and the little display.                                                                             |
| 34:05      | And it is currently, at least as we record on sale for 84.99 USD.                                                                                                       |
| 34:09      | So hopefully that sale will hold for the release of this episode, because that is a pretty                                                                              |
| 34:15      | good price.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 34:16      | I think another excellent use for a [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Neo]] would be as a profile driver on a bigger [[Stream Deck]].                                      |
| 34:23      | So if you've got the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Classic\\standard one]] or the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]], but you'd like to be able to jump between             |
| 34:27      | profiles the way I do with the static top one, but you don't want to buy a second [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]],                                                   |
| 34:34      | this would be perfect for that.                                                                                                                                         |
| 34:35      | Because you could put the various profile buttons on the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Neo]], and then that would change                                               |
| 34:40      | the setup on the bigger one.                                                                                                                                            |
| 34:42      | I don't know, I think that would be a good use.                                                                                                                         |
| 34:45      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 34:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:47      | I think it's one of those things where it's worth just spending a little bit of time playing                                                                            |
| 34:51      | with this.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34:52      | I put some links in the show notes for things like what are profiles on the [[Stream Deck]]                                                                             |
| 34:58      | and how can you automatically switch between profiles, so automatically when a particular                                                                               |
| 35:02      | application opens, and also how you can use one [[Stream Deck]] to control another.                                                                                     |
| 35:08      | But I think it is just worth having a look and seeing how could these things fit into                                                                                   |
| 35:14      | your life.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 35:15      | Because the beauty for me of the [[Stream Deck]] is I can remember keyboard shortcuts.                                                                                  |
| 35:20      | I do.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:21      | I customise keyboard shortcuts when they are wrong.                                                                                                                     |
| 35:23      | When I say wrong, I mean that I have 20 applications that use this keyboard shortcut to outdent,                                                                        |
| 35:29      | but this one does it differently.                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:31      | Well, that one gets changed, and so on.                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:34      | But even so, there is a limit to what I can comfortably hold in my head and remember,                                                                                   |
| 35:40      | and especially if it's not something that I'm going to be pressing all the time, or                                                                                     |
| 35:44      | not something I want to do accidentally easily, then I find having the [[Stream Deck]] with the                                                                         |
| 35:50      | picture buttons makes it so much easier, especially because you can do things like change the                                                                           |
| 35:54      | picture depending on various things that are going on.                                                                                                                  |
| 35:59      | So for example, if you are using [[Keyboard Maestro]], then that setup that I mentioned                                                                                 |
| 36:07      | that [[Timothy Luoma\|TJ Luoma]] [shared on GitHub](https://github.com/tjluoma/icalbuddy-km-and-stream-deck), and I will put a link to that in the show notes actually, |
| 36:14      | where you can have it change the image of the [[Stream Deck]] button based on the upcoming                                                                              |
| 36:21      | calendar event.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 36:22      | So as it gets closer, that colour will change.                                                                                                                          |
| 36:27      | And I personally find that that sort of thing is very easy, and then if I hit the button                                                                                |
| 36:30      | for the calendar event, then it will pop up in [[Fantastical]] for me.                                                                                                  |
| 36:35      | But depending on what you want to do with your [[Stream Deck]], there are so many possibilities,                                                                        |
| 36:41      | and there's just lots of great plugins and so on out there as well.                                                                                                     |
| 36:45      | Like [[KMlink]] is my preferred way of controlling keyboard or using [[Keyboard Maestro]] with the                                                                      |
| 36:56      | [[Stream Deck]], and it just works very, very well.                                                                                                                     |
| 37:00      | So having all of these options out there makes automating fun and also very, very simple.                                                                               |
| 37:08      | Yeah, exactly, and people think it's silly when I talk about it, how many of these things                                                                               |
| 37:14      | I've accumulated, and in fairness, I always buy the new one because I just kind of want                                                                                 |
| 37:18      | to talk about it on the show and be able to see what they're doing.                                                                                                     |
| 37:22      | But I'm also really impressed with the overall technology stack.                                                                                                        |
| 37:26      | The fact that I own five of them and the software has no problem with that, like it doesn't                                                                             |
| 37:30      | get hung up as I set buttons in different pieces of it.                                                                                                                 |
| 37:34      | It's all fairly impressive, and they have definitely pushed down the gas on this with                                                                                   |
| 37:40      | their marketplace.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 37:42      | There's so much stuff in there now.                                                                                                                                     |
| 37:43      | I don't even keep up with it.                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:45      | There's so much stuff.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37:46      | I can't stop and read it every day, but no matter how you want to customise this thing                                                                                  |
| 37:51      | to work for you, I feel like I'll got those really onto something.                                                                                                      |
| 37:55      | Maybe we could just go through a little bit of a lightning round and talk about some of                                                                                 |
| 37:58      | our favourite uses for it.                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:01      | I'll do a couple to begin with.                                                                                                                                         |
| 38:04      | I really like the home control stuff off the buttons.                                                                                                                   |
| 38:10      | The way I do that is through an app called [[HomeControl Menu for HomeKit\|HomeControl]], one word, and [[HomeControl Menu for HomeKit\|HomeControl]] allows          |
| 38:19      | you to generate a URL to trigger [[HomeKit]] actions, and then you can tie those to individual                                                                          |
| 38:27      | buttons.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 38:28      | Like I said, I can lock the front door, I can turn on the recording light, I can use                                                                                    |
| 38:32      | entire setups in the [[HomeKit]] application tied to a button.                                                                                                          |
| 38:39      | I set these up so long ago, and they just keep working.                                                                                                                 |
| 38:42      | I love it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:44      | I can turn all the lights on, like if I'm home alone and I hear a noise, I'm at my desk,                                                                                |
| 38:48      | I can push a button and turn all the lights on in the house or whatever, all off my stream                                                                              |
| 38:53      | deck.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:54      | That's a really fun feature for me.                                                                                                                                     |
| 38:56      | That is nice.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:58      | I have something similar for certain lights in my office, only the ones in my office really,                                                                            |
| 39:05      | and while thinking about it, I should actually add a button to my [[Stream Deck]] to buzz the                                                                           |
| 39:10      | intercom because I previously had a [[Nuki Opener]] for my intercom, and that was fine                                                                                  |
| 39:17      | until unfortunately at some point it just stopped charging and it now won't charge,                                                                                     |
| 39:22      | and even when it's plugged in, won't open my intercom, which is not great, so I ended                                                                                   |
| 39:26      | up buying a [[Ring Intercom]] buzzer, but it would be pretty nice if somebody buzzes the intercom.                                                                      |
| 39:33      | I do have it set up to automatically open at some point, but it would be nice to just                                                                                   |
| 39:37      | be able to press a button on my [[Stream Deck]] to buzz the intercom, so I think I'm going                                                                              |
| 39:41      | to have to do that.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:43      | I mentioned some of the things that I have already, so I actually have a little collection                                                                              |
| 39:48      | of buttons on my [[Stream Deck]] for work for opening a sprint, which is our current three-week                                                                         |
| 39:56      | period of work at work in our project tracker for opening a particular story, so it's big                                                                               |
| 40:03      | on a task, it's a mini project, I guess, and then also for opening tickets in the ticket                                                                                |
| 40:09      | system, and so all of those will pop up, they use [[Keyboard Maestro]], and it just runs a macro                                                                        |
| 40:15      | which pops up and says, hey, give me a number, I type in the number, and then it just shows                                                                             |
| 40:19      | it into the URL and opens it, very, very simple.                                                                                                                        |
| 40:22      | And then I have some classic buttons, I guess you could say, they just open particular applications,                                                                    |
| 40:30      | but they also make sure that I go to the right version of the application if that makes sense,                                                                          |
| 40:37      | so my [[Drafts]] button, it doesn't just open [[Drafts]], it opens [[Drafts]] using a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]                                                       |
| 40:43      | to a particular workspace, which means that I have the right actions and so on available                                                                                |
| 40:49      | to me, and that makes a big difference, just having things like that, because obviously                                                                                 |
| 40:54      | I can command tab and switch to certain applications, but it's nice to have that sort of thing.                                                                         |
| 41:02      | I also, and maybe you're going to want to steal some of these, David, I have a paste                                                                                    |
| 41:07      | button on my [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                                           |
| 41:10      | Now some people are thinking, Rose, it's command V, right?                                                                                                              |
| 41:14      | You know this.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:15      | I am very aware, paste is command V.                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:17      | The paste button on my [[Stream Deck]] will actually open [[Boop]] specifically, which is a great little                                                                |
| 41:23      | Mac application, and then it uses, I'm actually using [[Keyboard Maestro]] for this.                                                                                    |
| 41:28      | It does *Command + N* for new, as in wipe the slate clean, and then it pastes.                                                                                          |
| 41:33      | So this means that, you know, whatever is on my clipboard, which is usually a pretty                                                                                    |
| 41:38      | large chunk of data, gets pasted into a new [[Boop]] window, and [[Boop]] only ever has one window.                                                                             |
| 41:45      | It's not a document editor, it's for in-the-moment text, which you don't save, or you have to                                                                           |
| 41:52      | take it somewhere else to save it, very useful for formatting things and so on.                                                                                         |
| 41:57      | And I actually have a couple of other paste buttons as well, which is paste to [[Drafts]],                                                                              |
| 42:03      | and paste to [[OmniFocus]] as well, which will pop up with my quick capture for [[OmniFocus]],                                                                          |
| 42:09      | and then pastes into it.                                                                                                                                                |
| 42:10      | Okay, so I have to get out of this rabbit hole.                                                                                                                         |
| 42:13      | Why would you use [[Boop]] instead of just open a blank draft?                                                                                                          |
| 42:18      | So in this particular case, it's code-based text that I am pasting.                                                                                                     |
| 42:24      | So it'll be like [[JSON]], or it could be [[JavaScript]], or, you know, it could be [[SQL]], something like                                                             |
| 42:32      | that.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:33      | You know, there's a whole bunch of things that it could be, but it's usually like data                                                                                  |
| 42:39      | rather than text, and it'll be a lot of it.                                                                                                                             |
| 42:43      | So that's why I'll paste it in there, because, you know, if I've got raw [[HTML]], if I paste                                                                           |
| 42:48      | that into [[Boop]], then I can press *Command + B*, and then I can type format, because I'm now                                                                         |
| 42:54      | searching for it through its commands, and then I can use a format [[XML]].                                                                                             |
| 42:58      | I can format [[JSON]], I can [[Minification\|minify]] things, I can, you know, remove slashes or add slashes                                                                          |
| 43:04      | to [[Escaping\|escape stuff]], all sorts of stuff, very, very quickly and easily using [[Boop\|Boop's]] actions.                                                                   |
| 43:09      | So that's why I have a specific paste to [[Boop]], and also my paste into [[Drafts]] adds a work                                                                            |
| 43:16      | tag for those things, when I'm on a work machine, and if I'm in a podcasting mode, adds a podcasting                                                                    |
| 43:21      | tag, etc.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 43:23      | So that makes my life a little easier.                                                                                                                                  |
| 43:24      | Yeah, I've played over the years, like [[Boop]] looking at it is clearly a developer tool,                                                                              |
| 43:29      | so it's really for code.                                                                                                                                                |
| 43:31      | But I've played with over the years, trying out other apps in addition to [[Drafts]] to like                                                                            |
| 43:36      | hold temporary text.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 43:38      | What's the one made by [[The Icon Factory]]?                                                                                                                            |
| 43:41      | There's a little text app they have.                                                                                                                                    |
| 43:43      | [[Tot]]?                                                                                                                                                                |
| 43:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:45      | And, but I just feel like drafts does all this for me, I don't really need to make this                                                                                 |
| 43:49      | more complicated.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 43:51      | That's fair enough.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:52      | I mean, for me, [[Drafts]] is for text, not for data.                                                                                                                   |
| 43:57      | And when I've got a bunch of data, you know, I'll often paste it into [[Boop]], do a little                                                                             |
| 44:02      | formatting thingy, and then take it on to wherever else it needs to go, or if I need                                                                                    |
| 44:06      | to keep that and maybe multiples around for a while, then I'll put it into [[BBEdit]].                                                                                  |
| 44:12      | But I, yeah, I often throw things into [[Boop]] because there is no way to save.                                                                                        |
| 44:18      | It's just data that's there right now, and then it's going away.                                                                                                        |
| 44:22      | So for me, the fact that I'm not going to end up with a random draft that's got, you                                                                                    |
| 44:26      | know, potentially some client data in it or something that I might need to worry about                                                                                  |
| 44:30      | is very handy.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:31      | What a great name for an app, though.                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:33      | [[Boop]].                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:34      | Oh, it is.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:35      | It's so good.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:37      | And I also love the fact that the action shortcut is `Command + B` for [[Boop]].                                                                                        |
| 44:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:42      | So it also happens to be right between V and N. So that, that's great.                                                                                                  |
| 44:47      | Because you know, if you, if you paste that's V, if you want a blank [[Boop]] or two blank [[Boop]],                                                                    |
| 44:52      | I think it is more likely because it's, you're, you're emptying the content of what's currently                                                                         |
| 44:57      | there that's *Command + N* and *B* for [[Boop]] is right in the middle.                                                                                                     |
| 45:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 45:02      | Now, if you, the default setting usually is to create these profiles around specific                                                                                    |
| 45:08      | apps.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 45:09      | I thought earlier, I downloaded the [[Zoom]] profile set from [[Elgato]].                                                                                               |
| 45:14      | And I think when you set these up, it's very tempting.                                                                                                                  |
| 45:16      | Like I've made one for [[OmniFocus]], I've made one for [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                                 |
| 45:20      | But I also think a good tip for these is to create profiles, not based on a particular                                                                                  |
| 45:26      | app, but based on a particular context.                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:29      | So like I have one for my personal stuff.                                                                                                                               |
| 45:32      | And if I go to that page, it gets me to the banking into the, like the personal stuff                                                                                   |
| 45:36      | I do on my computer.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:38      | I've got another one for the blog, one for podcasts, one for the MacSparky Labs, one                                                                                    |
| 45:45      | for field guides.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:47      | And they all have interesting collection of buttons that just makes sense for when I'm                                                                                  |
| 45:51      | working in that context.                                                                                                                                                |
| 45:54      | And I find them really useful.                                                                                                                                          |
| 45:56      | Like, like one of the ones I have runs a [[Keyboard Maestro]] that copies a file to a folder on                                                                         |
| 46:03      | [[Dropbox]] and, and the way, and I covered this in the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide, but you                                                                       |
| 46:08      | can make a [[Keyboard Maestro]] file moving action, but then you can tie it to a button and [[Stream Deck]]                                                             |
| 46:16      | And I've got a picture of [[Jean Francois Brissette\|J. F. Brissette]] on there, the guy who helps me with editing.                                                     |
| 46:20      | And when I finish a file for him, I just go to the context and push the button of his                                                                                   |
| 46:25      | smiling face and the file gets sent to him.                                                                                                                             |
| 46:28      | And it's just like stuff like that makes sense.                                                                                                                         |
| 46:31      | And like I've got a one here I'm just looking at right now, the one I do for the labs.                                                                                  |
| 46:34      | I've got a voiceover button I've got in and out markers for [[ScreenFlow]].                                                                                             |
| 46:39      | It's just a whole bunch of different collection of things that I find useful when I'm working                                                                           |
| 46:43      | in that context, and not all of these have all the buttons taken.                                                                                                       |
| 46:49      | But whenever I find myself doing things repeatedly, I add a button for it.                                                                                              |
| 46:54      | And it actually is really nice to work in context on [[Stream Deck]] as well as on apps.                                                                                    |
| 47:00      | Yeah, I personally find that the context is much more important for me.                                                                                                 |
| 47:05      | So therefore I use manual profile switching than the automatic one.                                                                                                     |
| 47:12      | Because for example, right now, we are recording automators.                                                                                                            |
| 47:16      | That is what I am focused on.                                                                                                                                           |
| 47:18      | The fact that [[Safari]] is open because I've been adding links to the show notes, that's                                                                               |
| 47:23      | not relevant.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 47:24      | I don't want [[Safari]] buttons taking up the whole screen.                                                                                                             |
| 47:27      | Similarly, when I switch to the show notes to [[BBEdit]], I don't want BB edit taking over                                                                              |
| 47:33      | my whole screen.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:34      | I just want the buttons to be the same because I am podcasting.                                                                                                         |
| 47:41      | And I personally found that when I was having it automatically switch profiles based on                                                                                 |
| 47:46      | applications, the buttons were changing too much.                                                                                                                       |
| 47:50      | And I ended up with a halo of buttons around the outside that were the same for every profile.                                                                          |
| 47:56      | Because then I needed to still be able to access this thing even though I was currently                                                                                 |
| 48:01      | in [[Safari]].                                                                                                                                                          |
| 48:02      | Or I was trying to switch back to an application to do a certain action because the button had                                                                          |
| 48:06      | just disappeared as I switched applications or something.                                                                                                               |
| 48:09      | And that gets messy very, very quickly if you've got that sort of problem.                                                                                              |
| 48:13      | So yeah, I've gone for the context switching one.                                                                                                                       |
| 48:17      | I still not managed to nail down really switching profile automatically when I switch a context.                                                                        |
| 48:27      | And this is something that if you're using Better Touch Tool, it's a lot easier because                                                                                 |
| 48:32      | [[BetterTouchTool]] has more controls.                                                                                                                                  |
| 48:35      | But as far as I'm aware, even a [[Keyboard Maestro]] which has added all of the [[Stream Deck]] actions,                                                                |
| 48:42      | there is no way to switch profile with it, which is really frustrating.                                                                                                 |
| 48:47      | So you kind of have to like, what I've done is I've dedicated a button.                                                                                                 |
| 48:52      | It is usually in the top right.                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:56      | I currently have my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]] button there.                                                                                                     |
| 48:58      | So I'm going to have to shuffle some things around because obviously I was messing with                                                                                 |
| 49:01      | stuff earlier and I moved some things unintentionally.                                                                                                                  |
| 49:05      | But yeah, but usually the button in the top right opens a folder which has the different                                                                                |
| 49:10      | [[Stream Deck]] profiles for me.                                                                                                                                        |
| 49:12      | And I don't just have, there is a button, it's under the navigation section in the [[Stream Deck]]                                                                      |
| 49:19      | app, it's called switch profile.                                                                                                                                        |
| 49:24      | And it can do something like go to the next profile.                                                                                                                    |
| 49:28      | And you can specify which device you're controlling as well.                                                                                                            |
| 49:30      | Or it can just go to a specific profile.                                                                                                                                |
| 49:32      | The problem with next profiles, I never remember what order profiles are in.                                                                                            |
| 49:36      | And I create temporary profiles to test something out to see if this setup of these three things                                                                        |
| 49:42      | I'm going to want to change if that actually works for me.                                                                                                              |
| 49:46      | So just constantly switching to the next profile is not very helpful.                                                                                                   |
| 49:49      | So instead, I have it open a folder and in that folder, there are buttons for all of                                                                                    |
| 49:54      | the different profiles that I may want to switch to.                                                                                                                    |
| 49:58      | So yeah, that's what I'm doing there.                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:01      | Yeah, and see, that's the advantage.                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:03      | I'm going to talk you into buying another [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck XL\|XL]] because that's the advantage of having                                                     |
| 50:07      | an a static button.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 50:08      | I mean, I use the plus for this sort of thing a lot of the time.                                                                                                        |
| 50:12      | But I usually have a button on the [[Stream Deck]] as well.                                                                                                                 |
| 50:15      | It's just, I was shuffling some stuff around on my desk earlier and I've been out with                                                                                  |
| 50:18      | my [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck+\|Plus]] like shoved over to one side in a not particularly easy to access spot.                                                           |
| 50:23      | So I'm just going to try and pull that back.                                                                                                                            |
| 50:24      | There we go.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 50:25      | And now I can actually see the buttons and see the screen and press them.                                                                                               |
| 50:29      | So, so rather than switching through them because I've got so many buttons, I have a                                                                                    |
| 50:32      | dedicated button for each, each context and it's always there.                                                                                                          |
| 50:36      | So that makes it easy, but you're right.                                                                                                                                |
| 50:38      | I feel like if there's something they could improve on the software, it would be more                                                                                   |
| 50:42      | addressable via automation.                                                                                                                                             |
| 50:45      | Like you can change profiles with a shortcut exactly or something and they haven't gone                                                                                 |
| 50:50      | there.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:51      | You can go the other direction though.                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:53      | Like you could set up a button that triggers a shortcut and you could make the button kind                                                                              |
| 50:57      | of the, the impetus for everything.                                                                                                                                     |
| 51:00      | That's why I'm thinking about making my screen setups on this Neo like a thing because then                                                                             |
| 51:06      | it would trigger the timer and set up the screens and do all the, you know, it would                                                                                    |
| 51:10      | do all the things, but then I would really be bound to make the switch via the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Neo\|Stream Deck Neo]] as                                      |
| 51:16      | opposed to some other methodology.                                                                                                                                      |
| 51:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 51:18      | That's the thing because the, the action that I would use for that on the [[Stream Deck]],                                                                              |
| 51:23      | it's the multi-action.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:26      | And so a multi-action is just, hey, when you press this, do X amount of things.                                                                                         |
| 51:32      | And so within that multi-action, I would then add a profile action to switch the profile                                                                                |
| 51:40      | and then you could switch it to a particular profile.                                                                                                                   |
| 51:42      | And then you can use whatever action it is that you want to use for whatever your context                                                                               |
| 51:47      | switching thing is.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 51:49      | I would recommend folks, if you are looking to get into like context setups and so on,                                                                                  |
| 51:56      | I would recommend not building the whole thing as a multi-action in the [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                |
| 52:01      | Not because it's unreliable.                                                                                                                                            |
| 52:03      | I've not actually lost data within the [[Stream Deck]] profiles or anything, but just because                                                                           |
| 52:08      | you are not going to be able to trigger this from anything else.                                                                                                        |
| 52:11      | So if you temporarily unplug your [[Stream Deck]] or something, you're not going to be able                                                                             |
| 52:15      | to use it until you plug it back in, whereas if you create it in shortcuts, [[Keyboard Maestro]],                                                                       |
| 52:21      | [[Bunch]], [[Alfred]], whatever, like, then you can use that through everything else.                                                                                   |
| 52:27      | And then you can also trigger it from the [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                                                  |
| 52:30      | And so I often use [[KMlink]], which I've linked to in the show notes, to run a particular                                                                              |
| 52:36      | macro for this sort of thing with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                 |
| 52:42      | And then [[Keyboard Maestro]] is just, it's actually talking to [[Bunch]].                                                                                              |
| 52:46      | It's not very efficient, I guess, but it works.                                                                                                                         |
| 52:48      | It works 100% of the time.                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:49      | So I'm pretty happy about that.                                                                                                                                         |
| 52:52      | And yeah, if you do something like that with your multi-action, then you can switch the                                                                                 |
| 52:56      | profile and you can set up your context, but you are bound to doing it through your [[Stream Deck]].                                                                    |
| 53:05      | If you do it any other way, then you have to go into the [[Stream Deck]] settings and change                                                                            |
| 53:11      | your profile, which is not great, or use a different button to change it.                                                                                               |
| 53:16      | Well, overall, I think both of us would agree.                                                                                                                          |
| 53:19      | [[Stream Deck]] is a great tool slash toy if you're an automator, and you will constantly find                                                                          |
| 53:25      | uses for the buttons.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:27      | Don't feel bad about getting the big one.                                                                                                                               |
| 53:29      | I have two of them.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:30      | And if you want to try one and you don't have one, and you can't borrow one from a friend,                                                                              |
| 53:36      | if you do have a friend that has one good luck, try to pry it off them to be honest, unless                                                                             |
| 53:39      | they're genuinely really not using it because they probably haven't heard about the great                                                                               |
| 53:43      | automation possibilities.                                                                                                                                               |
| 53:45      | Then there is an iOS and an Android app that you can get where you can use your phone as                                                                                |
| 53:50      | a [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Mobile\|virtual Stream Deck]].                                                                                                              |
| 53:52      | It is subscription based.                                                                                                                                               |
| 53:53      | So I would recommend using this as like a trial to see if you would like the stream                                                                                     |
| 53:58      | deck.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:59      | But remember that the actual physical [[Stream Deck]] has hardware buttons as well, which are                                                                           |
| 54:02      | actually like pretty plastic buttons that you press.                                                                                                                    |
| 54:05      | And it's tactile, so you can feel the difference between the buttons.                                                                                                   |
| 54:10      | And there is a marker on the centre button on some profiles as well to help you find                                                                                    |
| 54:15      | it without looking.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 54:17      | So we're both fans, but there are alternatives kind of starting to show up.                                                                                             |
| 54:23      | Rose saw one called the [[Cooler Master]].                                                                                                                              |
| 54:26      | Tell us about that, Rose.                                                                                                                                               |
| 54:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 54:28      | So [[Cooler Master]], lovely brand.                                                                                                                                     |
| 54:30      | And I saw them at [[Computex]] and along with a bunch of other really cool things that they                                                                             |
| 54:37      | were showing off, they also have their [[MasterHUB]], including some new stuff which I do not                                                                          |
| 54:42      | photograph signs on, so I'm not going to talk about that just yet.                                                                                                      |
| 54:45      | But the thing about the [[Cooler Master]] is you've got sort of [[Stream Deck]] style button modules.                                                                   |
| 54:52      | But it's a module.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:54      | So you buy like a deck and then you've got modules that you can put on it.                                                                                              |
| 54:59      | So there's a big spinner with a display in the middle.                                                                                                                  |
| 55:03      | There's like three sort of volume knobs together.                                                                                                                       |
| 55:08      | There's a 15 button [[Stream Deck]] style thing.                                                                                                                        |
| 55:11      | There's some like paddles that can like move up and down.                                                                                                               |
| 55:16      | And it works in vertical, there's sliders as well.                                                                                                                      |
| 55:20      | And it's really, really cool.                                                                                                                                           |
| 55:22      | And I would really like to get my hands on one of these at some point because it looks                                                                                  |
| 55:27      | really, really cool.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:29      | But it is modular, so I don't yet know how much I would have to spend to set the whole                                                                                  |
| 55:38      | thing up.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 55:39      | But it is something that I would really like to try at some point.                                                                                                      |
| 55:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 55:42      | We'll put a link to this in the show notes.                                                                                                                             |
| 55:43      | It looks like kind of a nice competing platform.                                                                                                                        |
| 55:46      | The advantage is modularity.                                                                                                                                            |
| 55:48      | So you can kind of construct the controls the way you want.                                                                                                             |
| 55:51      | But they're going to have a hard time competing with [[Stream Deck]] unless they're willing to                                                                              |
| 55:55      | put some money into the software for sure.                                                                                                                              |
| 55:58      | Well their software, I saw it, I had a little play with it.                                                                                                             |
| 56:01      | It was on Windows, not Mac, but they did assure me that it's coming on Mac as well.                                                                                     |
| 56:06      | It felt very similar to the [[Stream Deck]] software.                                                                                                                   |
| 56:09      | It wasn't exactly the same, but it felt very similar in the way that you set things up.                                                                                 |
| 56:14      | You know, there's buttons that you can install and stuff like that.                                                                                                     |
| 56:17      | So I think that they've clearly seen what other people are doing and what works and                                                                                     |
| 56:23      | they are looking at that to take advantage of it.                                                                                                                       |
| 56:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:27      | And then you also have one with the [[Xencelabs Quick Keys]], which is something you've                                                                                 |
| 56:32      | talked about in prior episodes of the show.                                                                                                                             |
| 56:35      | It's like a little like control surface as well that you set aside next to your Mac.                                                                                    |
| 56:40      | We'll put a link to that as well.                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:43      | It's got programmable buttons and a dial.                                                                                                                               |
| 56:45      | I actually ordered one of these and tried it for a few days and found that I didn't really                                                                              |
| 56:50      | feel like it was doing anything that I wasn't already getting with my existing [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]]                                                            |
| 56:54      | and I didn't want one more thing on my desk, but how are you using this, Rose?                                                                                          |
| 56:59      | So this is always in my bag whenever I go to the office for a day.                                                                                                      |
| 57:06      | So I only go to a physical office once every three weeks and the whole team goes in on                                                                                  |
| 57:10      | the same day.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:11      | So it's a large conference room with up to 15 maybe more of us around tables with laptops                                                                               |
| 57:20      | and there's not a huge amount of space for a lot else.                                                                                                                  |
| 57:24      | So having an extra [[Stream Deck]] there or taking in a keyboard and mouse that are a bit nicer,                                                                        |
| 57:30      | that's not necessarily a huge great option because we are constrained on space.                                                                                         |
| 57:35      | The [[Xencelabs Quick Keys]] is narrow enough that I can always fit it in next to my laptop                                                                             |
| 57:41      | and it just gives me eight buttons and a dial which I can use as a sort of mini-[[Stream Deck]]                                                                         |
| 57:48      | and it works in portrait or landscape.                                                                                                                                  |
| 57:51      | And so I tend to use it for those days and I have a nice custom setup where I can switch                                                                                |
| 57:56      | to certain applications that I'll be using frequently on those days like [[Figma]] and, you                                                                             |
| 58:01      | know, our retro tracker[^2] and things like that where every three weeks as we finish a block                                                                           |
| 58:07      | of work, people over those three weeks put in some notes about what went well, what didn't                                                                              |
| 58:11      | go well and who's awesome and why they're awesome and then we go in and review that.                                                                                    |
| 58:16      | So yeah, I have links to pop-up and stuff like that and present and things like that.                                                                                   |
| 58:21      | So that's what I use it for because it is so small and it works wirelessly as well as                                                                                   |
| 58:26      | wired, which is a nice upgrade over the [[Stream Deck]], which only works if you plug it in.                                                                            |
| 58:32      | So if you don't have a spare port, which when I am doing these office days, I don't always                                                                              |
| 58:37      | have a spare port depending on what I'm doing, then it's quite nice to be able to use it                                                                                |
| 58:41      | on battery.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 58:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 58:43      | And then there's a whole variety of control surface things for like making final cut videos                                                                             |
| 58:48      | or whenever the [[Stream Deck]], while it's useful for those tools, it's not a replacement for                                                                              |
| 58:54      | those tools.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:55      | And I would say if you, if you know, if you need something like that with the big knobs                                                                                 |
| 59:00      | on it to do your video edits, it's not that the [[Stream Deck]] is not that either way.                                                                                 |
| 59:06      | I know a lot of listeners are already invested in [[Stream Deck]], but I thought it'd be fun                                                                            |
| 59:10      | to go back and talk about kind of what we're doing with the many insight we have.                                                                                       |
| 59:15      | The context thing for me is particularly useful.                                                                                                                        |
| 59:18      | I do love my collection of [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]].                                                                                                               |
| 59:20      | I would not give any of them up and I don't know that I need another one, but who knows                                                                                 |
| 59:25      | what [[Elgato]] is going to announce next, right?                                                                                                                       |
| 59:28      | I mean, that is the case though, I have to say I did join their [[Discord]].                                                                                            |
| 59:33      | And so I get all of the things about their live streams, which they are, they've been                                                                                   |
| 59:38      | doing quite a few of.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 59:40      | And so hopefully I will get a little heads up on things that are coming.                                                                                                |

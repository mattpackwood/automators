| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard, and this is The                  |
| 00:06      | Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.             |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                         |
| 00:12      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                             |
| 00:14      | I'm great.                                                                                           |
| 00:16      | As we record this, [[Apple]] had an announcement with a bunch of new iPads and updates, and              |
| 00:21      | we thought it would be a good chance for us to stop and check in on how we use iPad and              |
| 00:26      | how we automate iPad.                                                                                |
| 00:29      | That's the schedule for today.                                                                       |
| 00:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:33      | It's one of those things where [[Apple]] doesn't necessarily update every product super frequently,      |
| 00:39      | but they definitely do update various products on a regular basis, and when they do, it's            |
| 00:46      | always a nice opportunity to actually look at your devices and review your usage of them             |
| 00:50      | and whether or not it's worth upgrading, because the temptation is always, oh, pretty                |
| 00:55      | new shiny thing.                                                                                     |
| 00:57      | I'm pleased to report the iPad Air is not purple enough to get me to be considering                  |
| 01:01      | that, though the 13-inch is definitely something that I would be recommending for family members     |
| 01:06      | who are looking for a larger screen but don't need the power of the pro, but as it is, it's          |
| 01:12      | just a really great opportunity to go, hmm, what do I actually use this for?                         |
| 01:16      | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                       |
| 01:18      | I think that the big size of the iPad Air follows along with what they've been doing                 |
| 01:24      | in the other platforms, the MacBook Air, the standard iPhone, the non-pro iPhone, both               |
| 01:31      | got bigger versions recently, and I like that.                                                       |
| 01:34      | I know people who buy the big ones but don't need the pros, so that's great for them.                |
| 01:43      | There's a whole bunch of new iPads available when we release this show.                              |
| 01:47      | It's going to be a couple of weeks after the event, so you're probably already familiar              |
| 01:50      | with a lot of the news, but before we get into it, I thought it'd be interesting for                 |
| 01:56      | Rose and I just to share what iPads we own and what we're doing with them and as a precursor         |
| 02:04      | to how we're automating them.                                                                        |
| 02:06      | So Rose, what iPads do you own?                                                                      |
| 02:10      | Well, I own two iPads.                                                                               |
| 02:12      | I have my purple iPad Mini, which is the iPad Mini 6, which is the device that is usually            |
| 02:22      | with me most of the time.                                                                            |
| 02:23      | If I'm leaving the house and I'm not sure if I'm going to need a device, but I want                  |
| 02:27      | to take one with me, the iPad Mini 6 is the one that will go in the bag, and the other               |
| 02:32      | one that I own is the 11-inch iPad Pro 4th generation, so the one before the release                 |
| 02:37      | that we've just had, which I use with my [[Apple Magic Keyboard\|Magic Keyboard]], and yeah, those are my two iPads            |
| 02:44      | right now.                                                                                           |
| 02:45      | What about you, David?                                                                               |
| 02:47      | I've got the whole set, kind of.                                                                     |
| 02:51      | I have the 13 and the 11-inch from 2018, I'm not sure which generation it is, but when               |
| 02:55      | they switched over to the kind of squared-off form factor that they still more or less have,         |
| 03:02      | I've got one of each of those.                                                                       |
| 03:04      | I have an iPad Mini, I believe, five, but my daughter has been using it a lot, and I'm               |
| 03:12      | not sure if I could still call that as my own at this point, but I've had a lot of iPads             |
| 03:20      | for a while, and like with this event coming up, I was very curious about what's going               |
| 03:24      | on.                                                                                                  |
| 03:25      | I kind of feel like I want to upgrade, but I'm not really sure.                                      |
| 03:29      | The way I use the iPads, it varies, but I do use it as a productivity device, although               |
| 03:35      | I'm pretty tame in that.                                                                             |
| 03:38      | I use it kind of within the constraints of what an iPad is.                                          |
| 03:41      | I mean, that's the big knock against the iPad is there's a bunch of stuff you can do on              |
| 03:45      | a Mac that you can't do on the iPad, but at the same time, there's a lot of stuff that               |
| 03:50      | is very useful on the iPad that I find more productive and delightful, I guess for lack              |
| 03:57      | of a better word, on the iPad.                                                                       |
| 03:59      | I do a lot of reading on it.                                                                         |
| 04:02      | I do my day management stuff.                                                                        |
| 04:04      | I've got a little chair in my studio, a little leather chair, and I sit there in the morning,        |
| 04:09      | and either in Vision Pro or on iPad, I go through [[OmniFocus]].                                         |
| 04:13      | I look through my calendar, sort things out.                                                         |
| 04:16      | I answer emails.                                                                                     |
| 04:18      | I dictate a bunch of text, and all of those things are really easy to do on iPad, and I              |
| 04:26      | feel like the magical piece of glass that [[Apple]] talks about kind of is true for that                 |
| 04:33      | kind of work.                                                                                        |
| 04:34      | I'd say that's probably the first big use I have for it is just the little daily task                |
| 04:40      | kind of stuff getting me away from my desk.                                                          |
| 04:43      | How about you?                                                                                       |
| 04:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 04:45      | I mean, for me, I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk.                                            |
| 04:48      | I have my day job where I'm sitting here eight hours a day, but also I like to travel.               |
| 04:54      | One of the things that I do use my 11-inch iPad Pro for in particular is specifically                |
| 05:01      | as a portable entertainment system.                                                                  |
| 05:03      | If I am potentially going somewhere and maybe getting on a plane, for example, then I will           |
| 05:10      | load up my iPad in advance with a whole bunch of films and TV shows and things like that             |
| 05:17      | to watch so that I can watch them on planes and trains and so on.                                    |
| 05:21      | I've got quite a bit of flying to do it soon.                                                        |
| 05:25      | I'm going to Taiwan to go to [[Computex]], which some folks will have heard about a little bit           |
| 05:30      | through their spot on the last episode.                                                              |
| 05:33      | That's something where I am going to be using my iPad heavily because you can fit a laptop           |
| 05:39      | on a tray table on an airplane, but an iPad takes up considerably less space, which is               |
| 05:45      | quite nice if you don't want to be taking up all of the space that's available to you                |
| 05:50      | with one singular laptop.                                                                            |
| 05:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 05:53      | I'll second the nomination there on the airplane stuff.                                              |
| 05:56      | It's just so much better, especially if the person in front of you tilts their seat back             |
| 05:59      | and all that.                                                                                        |
| 06:01      | An iPad to me is the only technology that I've used on airplanes for years.                          |
| 06:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 06:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 06:09      | I have used other devices on planes and I probably will, but the fact that I'll be                   |
| 06:13      | able to have my iPad and just be watching things and also use it in my hotel room and                |
| 06:19      | stuff like that as well without having to worry about figuring out a way to connect something        |
| 06:25      | to the TV and carrying a universal remote and stuff with me, that's definitely one                   |
| 06:31      | of my uses.                                                                                          |
| 06:32      | That's probably a very common use case, but the other way that I use the iPad is to give             |
| 06:37      | me a little bit of a context change.                                                                 |
| 06:40      | I do want to get out of my office, but when it comes to doing things like my OmniFocus               |
| 06:44      | weekly review of the projects and so on that I've got in [[OmniFocus]], I do explicitly try              |
| 06:50      | to do that on my iPad, so I'll grab my iPad, go somewhere, sometimes it might be a cafe              |
| 06:55      | in town or go sit on a bench or a picnic blanket in the park as the weather's getting                |
| 07:00      | nicer, or it may just be go sit in my living room and go through this.                               |
| 07:05      | I find that the act of getting away from my desk with all of the other distractions and              |
| 07:10      | kind of forcing myself down to not a mono-tasking system because you can do more than one thing       |
| 07:14      | on the iPad at once very easily with [[Stage Manager]] now, but trying to get away from something        |
| 07:21      | where it's so easy to open up 78 billion tabs and just be running multiple things simultaneously     |
| 07:30      | is very useful for that.                                                                             |
| 07:32      | Similarly I will also use it for dumping things out of my head into [[Drafts]], just quickly create      |
| 07:38      | a whole bunch of drafts, just type command n, type command n, type command n, and then               |
| 07:43      | afterwards I can process them and deal with them, and that makes me quite happy whenever             |
| 07:49      | I'm doing that.                                                                                      |
| 07:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 07:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 07:52      | I mean, I find it really kind of useful, but it is definitely not a Mac.                             |
| 07:57      | There are things that I can do on the Mac that just don't really work on iPad.                       |
| 08:02      | Another usage I have for iPad is I've gotten really into 3D drafting and design over the             |
| 08:10      | last year or so between my 3D printer and the woodworking stuff.                                     |
| 08:17      | I've really latched onto the [[Shapr3D]] app and it's great and really good for design work              |
| 08:23      | and with an [[Apple Pencil]], it just works.                                                             |
| 08:25      | It's fantastic.                                                                                      |
| 08:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 08:27      | That's one of the things that I am intrigued by with the new iPads with the new [Apple Pencil\|Apple Pencils]]        |
| 08:33      | because I don't use my [[Apple Pencil]] as much as I could.                                              |
| 08:36      | I'm aware of that, and there are definitely people out there who will use it a lot more              |
| 08:41      | than I do, but I do love being able to just pick it up and quickly draw a diagram and                |
| 08:45      | sketch something out.                                                                                |
| 08:47      | Also, they use the phrase barrel roll in the presentation, and that is always exciting               |
| 08:54      | to hear.                                                                                             |
| 08:55      | If you type, do a barrel roll into Google, it will still do a barrel roll on screen.                 |
| 09:00      | Same as if you Google recursion, it will actually send you on a recursive pattern to explain         |
| 09:06      | what recursion is, which is quite entertaining when somebody doesn't get it and you see them         |
| 09:09      | click the thing about five times and then it dawns on them.                                          |
| 09:14      | But yeah, as it is, there's just so much that the iPad is great for in particular.                   |
| 09:20      | For me, I love the fact that there is the Magic Keyboard and I don't use the [[Apple Magic Keyboard\|Magic Keyboard]]          |
| 09:26      | on my iPad Mini.                                                                                     |
| 09:27      | I have a case from [MOFT](https://www.moft.us), which will allow my iPad Mini to stand up a bit higher when                 |
| 09:32      | it's propped up.                                                                                     |
| 09:34      | I find that it's nice to be able to use it in landscape, but also just grab it and have              |
| 09:39      | a small portrait handheld device.                                                                    |
| 09:42      | I have had the 13-inch iPad Pro before, and it was excellent for doing a lot of things,              |
| 09:49      | and I suspect especially now that shortcuts and [[Stage Manager]] have come in, it would be              |
| 09:54      | a lot easier to do my fun automation tasks on there, but I didn't find that it offered               |
| 10:01      | me a huge number of advantages over the 11-inch iPad, and it came with the downside of it            |
| 10:06      | weighed a ton.                                                                                       |
| 10:07      | So I didn't take it places unless I knew I was going to want it.                                     |
| 10:11      | And as it is now, I'm very excited because I always have something that's more than my               |
| 10:17      | iPhone for allowing me to mess with shortcuts and things like that.                                  |
| 10:24      | I was on the train to London the other day, and I could have done what I wanted to do                |
| 10:29      | on my iPad Mini.                                                                                     |
| 10:30      | Oh, sorry, on my iPhone, but I have my iPad Mini, so I did it on my iPad Mini, and it                |
| 10:34      | was a much nicer experience just because I had a bit more space, and I could open two                |
| 10:39      | versions of shortcuts and things like that, and it all adds up to be a better experience             |
| 10:44      | having that larger screen.                                                                           |
| 10:46      | So if you have to pick one, is iPad Mini the one?                                                    |
| 10:50      | I don't know because the problem with the iPad Mini is if you get a keyboard that actually           |
| 10:56      | fits the size of the iPad Mini.                                                                      |
| 10:59      | It is too small to type on, like you're missing buttons in places and stuff like that.               |
| 11:04      | I have one, it's a faux magic keyboard that connects via [[Bluetooth]], and it's fine, but               |
| 11:09      | it weighs a ton.                                                                                     |
| 11:10      | And so by the time you've got the iPad Mini plus that keyboard, it's like, okay, my handbag          |
| 11:15      | which went from being exceptionally light is now like my arms falling off type thing.                |
| 11:23      | So yeah, I don't know because the 11-inch is just so, it's such a good size, it's a                  |
| 11:31      | Goldilocks size for me, so I think it's probably the 11-inch as much as I love that 7.9-inch         |
| 11:37      | screen.                                                                                              |
| 11:38      | Yeah, I mean, that's always the question, and it really depends what you do with it                  |
| 11:42      | if you're traveling a lot.                                                                           |
| 11:44      | When you're on the road, the iPad Mini almost disappears in your bag, and that is really             |
| 11:49      | nice, but the iPad 11-inch kind of can do everything.                                                |
| 11:54      | Like for instance, like the 3D design stuff I'm doing, it's just, I don't think it would             |
| 11:59      | work very well for me on the iPad Mini, I just don't have enough room to work.                       |
| 12:04      | And I like to read sheet music on my iPad, and it's another thing where on the iPad                  |
| 12:08      | Mini, it's just way too small for me to read it, and so I really go back and forth.                  |
| 12:14      | So I'm in a weird spot, I've got a really old, two really old iPad Pros, and I think                 |
| 12:20      | I may be able to get my iPad Mini back if I want, so it's like, I don't know if my future            |
| 12:25      | is dumping the iPad 11 Pro or giving it to my wife and just keeping it 13 when I'm working           |
| 12:33      | at home and I want the big screen and the Mini when I'm on the road, or getting rid                  |
| 12:37      | of all of them and just getting an iPad 11-inch Pro, making it the one iPad to rule them all.        |
| 12:43      | But I'm actually really up in the air about what the right iPad for me is at this point,             |
| 12:49      | but I think we both use these things to get work done.                                               |
| 12:52      | It's not just consumption devices.                                                                   |
| 12:55      | Yes, yeah, exactly.                                                                                  |
| 12:57      | And it's so difficult to just pick one when you do actually use them for output as well              |
| 13:04      | as input.                                                                                            |
| 13:05      | And that's not to say that reading things and so on can't be productive and useful.                  |
| 13:10      | Absolutely can, but especially when you're producing things, that makes it much more                 |
| 13:16      | difficult to decide on what is the actual correct device for you because it's contextual.            |
| 13:26      | It depends.                                                                                          |
| 13:28      | So yeah, I mean, there's so many good things about it.                                               |
| 13:31      | I mean, just most of the stuff I do, like [[Day One]] entries, drafts entries, [[OmniFocus]]                 |
| 13:39      | work, all that stuff works just fine on the iPad mini.                                               |
| 13:44      | That's the thing, right?                                                                             |
| 13:45      | So it does most of the little things I do.                                                           |
| 13:48      | And even just watching video, that screen's big enough for me.                                       |
| 13:52      | It's just when I get into the more creative work that I wish I had more pixels.                      |
| 13:56      | Yeah, and that is definitely something where sometimes you just can't see enough of a thing          |
| 14:03      | on a screen.                                                                                         |
| 14:04      | And it's really hard to say, to do anything about that unless you can get a bigger screen.           |
| 14:09      | So, Rose, let's talk about how we're automating these things we're the automators.                      |
| 14:15      | We got stuff we do.                                                                                  |
| 14:17      | We both have a bunch of stuff on our list here, so I thought we could just jump back                 |
| 14:21      | and forth.                                                                                           |
| 14:22      | I'll tell you one thing about automation with the iPad for me is this is the only platform           |
| 14:27      | that I use the shortcuts widget.                                                                     |
| 14:29      | Like I have a series of context based buttons, and I've talked about it before on the show.          |
| 14:36      | Like I've got one called Personal and one called MacSparky, and so it's a choose from               |
| 14:42      | menu shortcut, and it's got like all of the most common stuff I do.                                  |
| 14:47      | As an example, on the MacSparky one, there's like set up a new project or add a task to             |
| 14:54      | [[OmniFocus]] or just all the kind of stuff I do, even stuff like go to my bank website at               |
| 15:00      | the specific URL.                                                                                    |
| 15:02      | And so stuff I do commonly, I run out of that little magic button, and I'm constantly updating       |
| 15:10      | it and adding things to it and taking things away from it.                                           |
| 15:12      | But I find this one of my favourite automations because on iPad, it's really, you know, sometimes     |
| 15:20      | more difficult to do things like go to a specific URL or set up some of this stuff and having        |
| 15:26      | it all just attached to a single button works really nice.                                           |
| 15:29      | I do the same thing on my iPhone, and what I do in the iPhone is I export the shortcut               |
| 15:34      | as an app icon, and I put it in my dock.                                                             |
| 15:37      | So the dock on my iPhone is these choose from menu shortcuts that I can do most of the important     |
| 15:42      | stuff in my life in.                                                                                 |
| 15:44      | But because the dock space is limited on iPad, and I like to put a lot of apps down there,           |
| 15:50      | what I do is I use the shortcuts widget on iPad, and I put those in the small, I think,              |
| 15:57      | two by two [[Shortcuts]] widget that gives me four, shows me four shortcuts.                             |
| 16:03      | So that's the first automation thing I do differently is just the way I launch this                  |
| 16:07      | like really critical shortcut is I put it on the desktop.                                            |
| 16:11      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 16:13      | I find that I still don't really use the [[Shortcuts]] widget.                                           |
| 16:17      | I did recently have one to my iPhone home screen, which will get me the, it'll open a                |
| 16:21      | specific page for the next like train times, depending on like what's in my calendar and             |
| 16:27      | so on, which is pretty cool.                                                                         |
| 16:28      | But on my iPad, I tend to just do [[Spotlight]], [[Spotlight]] for everything.                               |
| 16:35      | And it works surprisingly well.                                                                      |
| 16:36      | It will find shortcuts and everything else, because that's part of, you know, the [[Spotlight]]          |
| 16:45      | integration with it now.                                                                             |
| 16:47      | So I'm pretty happy about that, to be honest, because it makes my life a lot easier.                 |
| 16:52      | I'm already using the keyboard for everything.                                                       |
| 16:55      | So you know, why wouldn't I want to be able to use it for this too?                                  |
| 17:01      | And I definitely can.                                                                                |
| 17:03      | The [[Shortcuts]] is the key platform of automation.                                                     |
| 17:07      | I mean, one of the downsides of iPad is it just doesn't have the open openness for automation        |
| 17:13      | that the Mac does.                                                                                   |
| 17:14      | Like, you know, an app like [[Keyboard Maestro]] couldn't exist on the iPad.                           |
| 17:19      | And that really is the reason why a lot of times I will take a MacBook Air instead of                |
| 17:26      | an iPad with me because of the way I've wired automation on my Mac so much more than I have          |
| 17:32      | on an iPad.                                                                                          |
| 17:35      | But I will say that the, that the iPad with [[Shortcuts]], there is a lot you can automate.              |
| 17:42      | And I think we're probably both of us going to be focused on a lot of [[Shortcuts]] based                |
| 17:45      | automation today.                                                                                    |
| 17:46      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 17:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 17:48      | I mean, it's, it's not the only thing that's going on there, but it is very definitely               |
| 17:53      | something that it's so easy to do right on the iPad because obviously there's [[Drafts]]                 |
| 18:00      | and there's [[OmniFocus]] with [[Omni Automation]] adds with the rest of the Omni suite of apps.                   |
| 18:04      | And there's other apps as well, which do a whole bunch of great automation things, you               |
| 18:09      | know, like Secure ShellFish and so on, which, which allow me to, you know, connect to other          |
| 18:13      | machines and there's stuff built into that.                                                          |
| 18:17      | But at the same time, shortcuts is kind of, you know, the, the, the basic thing upon which           |
| 18:23      | everything else gets called, or at least it is for me, you know, I, a lot of things wouldn't         |
| 18:28      | happen for me unless I had shortcuts in the background, making sure that I actually ran              |
| 18:34      | the things.                                                                                          |
| 18:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 18:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 18:37      | And one of the other automation platforms though that I do use often on iPad is drafts.              |
| 18:42      | I mean, iPad for me in a lot of ways is just a writing machine and I love it.                        |
| 18:48      | I like that, you know, it's simple to use.                                                           |
| 18:52      | It is, you can limit the context of it and limit the interruptions of it.                            |
| 18:58      | So it is kind of a unit task, even though we just got done saying it's not really, but               |
| 19:03      | with drafts, you know, and a keyboard and using [[Drafts]] automation, there's just a ton                |
| 19:09      | of stuff I do in [[Shortcuts]], I'm sorry, not in [[Shortcuts]], but in [[Drafts]], using [[Drafts]]                 |
| 19:14      | automation to send texts to all sorts of places on my iPad and often to the internet.                |
| 19:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:21      | And it's amazing how much stuff that you can get done and also sometimes just how much,              |
| 19:26      | how many things, you know, that you can just sort of experiment with a little bit and it's           |
| 19:29      | really easy to do because [[Shortcuts]] is right there and you just pull in a couple of blocks           |
| 19:33      | and bam, you know, thing, you know, tested or you needed to create a list of like 17                 |
| 19:40      | items.                                                                                               |
| 19:41      | But, you know, it was like, you had to prefix them all with numbers or something like that.          |
| 19:45      | You know, it's very easy to do something like that in, in [[Shortcuts]].                                 |
| 19:50      | Once you've, you know, you just write down a list, split it, maybe use the file action               |
| 19:53      | to sort it and then repeat with each to add the numbers.                                             |
| 19:57      | And, yeah, without it, I think working on the iPad could be a lot trickier than it is                |
| 20:03      | because it's a shame that, you know, a lot of people seem not to take the iPad seriously             |
| 20:08      | for work because it can be a very good work tool, but fortunately because of the automation          |
| 20:14      | tools out there, I'm actually able to use it as that and you are as well by the sounds               |
| 20:18      | of it.                                                                                               |
| 20:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 20:20      | I mean, I understand why some people complain because it's not a work tool for every kind            |
| 20:25      | of work.                                                                                             |
| 20:26      | I mean, Mac is way more flexible in that regard.                                                     |
| 20:28      | I mean, podcasters always bring this up, but on the Mac, it's rudimentary to be on a [[Zoom]]            |
| 20:36      | call like we are right now, but have a separate app independently recording audio, which is          |
| 20:41      | what you need to make a podcast.                                                                     |
| 20:42      | And for whatever reason, they've just never enabled that on an iPad.                                 |
| 20:46      | So there's all these kind of like hard stops you hit on an iPad with certain kinds of work.          |
| 20:52      | But if your job is dealing with email, writing, you know, just kind of doing the basics of,          |
| 20:59      | you know, information work, it can do a lot of it for you.                                           |
| 21:05      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 21:07      | And it's one of these things as well where, no, not every device or operating system is              |
| 21:12      | going to be ideal for everybody to do their job or to produce whatever it is they need               |
| 21:18      | to do.                                                                                               |
| 21:19      | But at the same time, I think it is, you know, it's easy to undersell the iPad.                      |
| 21:24      | And there's so much that I do do with it all the time, but you know, it's pretty awesome             |
| 21:29      | to be sitting there and just be like, okay, I'm just going to update my website.                     |
| 21:33      | And I have a static website.                                                                         |
| 21:35      | This is not something where I can just log into a web page and mess around and type things           |
| 21:41      | into a web page and then have a look in a different tab and see what it looks like.                  |
| 21:45      | I have to, you know, write code and then have it compiled and so on.                                 |
| 21:49      | And I have a system setup where I can actually do that.                                              |
| 21:52      | And that's great.                                                                                    |
| 21:53      | I love that.                                                                                         |
| 21:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 21:55      | I think you, you know, you just have to find where it can fit.                                       |
| 22:00      | Like for me, one of the reasons why I write so much of my automation about project creation          |
| 22:07      | in shortcuts is because I find it really easy and convenient to create project setups on             |
| 22:14      | iPad because a lot of times I'm doing communication on iPad, email and whatnot.                      |
| 22:19      | And so somebody says, yes, I want to do that thing with you and it's on, this isn't this             |
| 22:23      | date.                                                                                                |
| 22:24      | Well, I want to be able to set that project up and [[Shortcuts]] on iPad can do that very                |
| 22:29      | easily.                                                                                              |
| 22:30      | And like in the previous years, I had, I would set those up in [[Keyboard Maestro]], you know,            |
| 22:35      | go create a note, create an [[Obsidian]] note, create a calendar event, you know, set up                 |
| 22:40      | an [[OmniFocus]] template, et cetera, and I realised that I know I really need to do that on iPad        |
| 22:47      | because often the confirmation happens when I'm sitting in my comfy chair answering email.           |
| 22:52      | And that, you know, putting it in shortcuts made that possible.                                      |
| 22:56      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 22:57      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 22:58      | And for me, you know, what I've done over time is, you know, I do want my automations                |
| 23:03      | to be platform agnostic where appropriate.                                                           |
| 23:06      | So for example, logging timestamps to give to our wonderful editor gym for the show notes.           |
| 23:13      | So if there's anything in there that we, you know, we need to take out or just where we              |
| 23:17      | have a quick pause, we can put those in.                                                             |
| 23:20      | That is not an automation that needs to be platform agnostic because I will be sitting               |
| 23:23      | down at my Mac to record the show.                                                                   |
| 23:27      | But something like creating a project or sending an email that's got a particular series of          |
| 23:33      | information in it and things like that.                                                              |
| 23:36      | That's something where maybe I'll run it from my Mac, maybe I'll run it from my iPad, maybe          |
| 23:39      | I'll run it from my iPhone.                                                                          |
| 23:41      | And I want to be able to do it in all the places.                                                    |
| 23:44      | So I tend to start with the iPad as the common denominator because out of all the platforms,         |
| 23:49      | it actually generally usually has the least features natively in shortcuts.                          |
| 23:55      | For example, it cannot vibrate.                                                                      |
| 23:57      | So I can't use the vibrate action, neither can my Mac, but that's okay.                              |
| 24:00      | It could have cellular, but it doesn't always have cellular and things like that.                    |
| 24:04      | And yeah, I've ended up with some really great shortcuts for things like that.                       |
| 24:08      | It's amazing as well how some of these have evolved over time, which maybe we need to                |
| 24:12      | talk about how we're clearing up some of this stuff in the background, David, because there's        |
| 24:17      | definitely some things maybe that I could do with improving there.                                   |
| 24:22      | But there's some really great integrations in particular between [[Drafts]] and [[Shortcuts]]                |
| 24:28      | and also in my case, [[OmniFocus]] and [[Shortcuts]], because that's what I'm using to get a lot             |
| 24:35      | of this done.                                                                                        |
| 24:36      | You know, I'll have something pop up and ask me, okay, what's the name of the project?               |
| 24:40      | Choose from these templates, which are stored in [[Drafts]] and bam, pull it in, replace some            |
| 24:45      | information, pop it over to [[OmniFocus]], and done.                                                     |
| 24:48      | Next.                                                                                                |
| 24:49      | Yeah, that's exactly the kind of platform agnostic automation that I think you should                |
| 24:54      | be thinking about when you're choosing platform automations.                                         |
| 24:57      | And for me, the iPad is always underlying it because I do like to do processing and work             |
| 25:03      | on the iPad, so I want the ability to do that type of work on the iPad.                              |
| 25:09      | And fortunately, the automation is mature enough on iPad that this is something that I think         |
| 25:15      | is very possible for people to do now.                                                               |
| 25:18      | Another one that I've been using a lot, and I've been talking about [[Whisper Memos]] because            |
| 25:21      | that just happens to be the one I've kind of landed on, but there's a lot of apps right              |
| 25:26      | now that you talk to and they use [[Whisper]] transcription to do it for you.                            |
| 25:30      | But I find that's another type of automation, of text automation that really suits itself            |
| 25:36      | to the iPad.                                                                                         |
| 25:37      | You know, sitting there in front of the iPad, get the microphone running, and then you can           |
| 25:41      | still have resource information you're looking at.                                                   |
| 25:45      | Yes, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 25:47      | And it's amazing how many of these tools have just got better and better and better since            |
| 25:55      | the iPad has been around, and some of these things have come into existence only because             |
| 26:01      | of the iPad.                                                                                         |
| 26:02      | So for example, what are the applications that I use quite frequently for automating                 |
| 26:07      | things and just doing niggly bits that I would otherwise have to reach for a Mac for                 |
| 26:12      | on my iPad is [[a-Shell]], so a [[Bash\|Bash shell]].                                                              |
| 26:16      | There's also [a-shell\|a-shell mini]], but it's a [[Terminal\|terminal]] on your iPad, and it allows you to work essentially   |
| 26:25      | from the command line, which is not something that necessarily everybody's going to want.            |
| 26:29      | And I get that.                                                                                      |
| 26:30      | I'm totally fine with that.                                                                          |
| 26:32      | But for me, when I need to do something that I know exactly how I would do it on the command         |
| 26:37      | line, and maybe [[Shortcuts]] doesn't have the right actions for it or something, then it's              |
| 26:42      | really nice to be able to just reach for [[a-Shell]] to do things like that.                             |
| 26:47      | And especially with a keyboard, it's very easy to do.                                                |
| 26:51      | You also mentioned that you're using automation via [[Stage Manager]] on iPad.                           |
| 26:57      | What are you doing there?                                                                            |
| 26:58      | Yeah, so this is something I've been experimenting with a little bit, and it's not something         |
| 27:03      | that I'm necessarily doing a lot of.                                                                 |
| 27:07      | But what I am doing is I've been experimenting with a couple of automations when I turn [[Stage Manager]]        |
| 27:14      | on or off.                                                                                   |
| 27:16      | So usually, if I turn [[Stage Manager]] off, it's because some application is not playing                |
| 27:22      | ball quite in the way that it's supposed to.                                                         |
| 27:25      | There's something weird going on.                                                                    |
| 27:28      | I don't know exactly what it is.                                                                     |
| 27:31      | But if I turn it off, I don't currently have anything set up.                                        |
| 27:34      | But what I have done is when I turn it back on, I'm experimenting with specifically opening          |
| 27:41      | a couple of applications at the same time.                                                           |
| 27:44      | So there's a native shortcut action for opening something in [[Split View]], which doesn't work           |
| 27:51      | as a [[Split View]] when you've got [[Stage Manager]] enabled.                                                |
| 27:57      | But what it does do is it opens up those two applications in their own window of [[Stage Manager]],              |
| 28:03      | essentially, or in their own desktop on [[Stage Manager]].                                      |
| 28:07      | So for me, that's [[OmniFocus]] and [[Drafts]] because if I've been doing stuff and I turn a [[Stage Manager]]          |
| 28:12      | back on, I'm always happy to have those two opening in front of me.                          |
| 28:15      | That's fine.                                                                                         |
| 28:17      | And then it's very easy, if necessary, to tap back to whatever it was that I needed.                 |
| 28:22      | But one thing I have been playing with is plugging my iPad into an external monitor.                 |
| 28:26      | And so when I plug my iPad into an external monitor, I am then making sure a [[Stage Manager]]           |
| 28:31      | is turned on because that seems to work very well for me on the iPad.                                |
| 28:35      | I'm still not using [[Stage Manager]] on the Mac.                                                        |
| 28:36      | It doesn't quite gel with my brain there, but on the iPad, it's working pretty nicely.               |
| 28:42      | Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.                                                                     |
| 28:43      | Another thing that you do that I like is using automation to toggle cellular.                        |
| 28:48      | And that's primarily a podcasting thing, but I think if you go into meetings or go anywhere          |
| 28:53      | where you don't want your cellular radio to cause your iPad to start making noise, that's            |
| 28:59      | a useful automation.                                                                                 |
| 29:01      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 29:02      | In my case, specifically what I do is when my podcasting focus mode turns on, I turn                 |
| 29:08      | off cellular.                                                                                        |
| 29:09      | And then when my podcasting focus mode turns off, I turn cellular back on.                           |
| 29:13      | And the reason for this is very simple.                                                              |
| 29:15      | If the cellular iPad gets close to the XLR cable that my microphone is plugged in through,           |
| 29:20      | then you get a bit of, bit of, bit of, or something that may sound like a helicopter                 |
| 29:24      | taking off.                                                                                          |
| 29:25      | It is not a pleasant experience for anybody involved.                                                |
| 29:28      | And to avoid having to deal with that and either have Jim do lots and lots of hard work              |
| 29:34      | or us having to rerecord every single episode until I finally get it right, I just set up            |
| 29:38      | an automation to disable that.                                                                       |
| 29:40      | So if my iPad is on my desk and near the microphone, then I don't have to worry about it interfering |
| 29:46      | with the recording because that seems like a much more sensible approach to solving that             |
| 29:51      | problem than potentially any of the other ones.                                                      |
| 29:54      | I could turn on airplane mode, but I don't need airplane mode.                                       |
| 29:57      | I just need cellular turned off.                                                                     |
| 29:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 30:00      | Another thing I do a lot is [[OmniFocus]], and that is [[Shortcuts]] space exclusively, but I've              |
| 30:06      | just, I have "shortcutted" the heck out of [[OmniFocus]].                                                  |
| 30:09      | And so like project creation, view setup, all that stuff, and I run all of that on iPad.             |
| 30:17      | And it allows me to really make my task manager go fast.                                             |
| 30:22      | Some of the new [[JavaScript]] stuff is finding its way in this as well.                                 |
| 30:25      | I mean, the reason they built it that way, so it would work on iPad.                                 |
| 30:28      | So I find a lot of automation going on in task management.                                           |
| 30:33      | And I really like to not spend a lot of time with [[OmniFocus]] on my Mac when I can avoid it.           |
| 30:41      | Like sitting down in the morning and setting up that, the day, and then I usually write              |
| 30:45      | it down on one of those month cards, what I'm actually going to do the day.                          |
| 30:49      | That's usually enough.                                                                               |
| 30:51      | So where project and task management doesn't really happen too much in the day except capture.       |
| 30:57      | And then I can go back later to the iPad.                                                            |
| 31:00      | It's another example of having that separate space and that separate context to keep the             |
| 31:07      | work separate.                                                                                       |
| 31:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 31:09      | And I think that that is something that is easier to get with the iPad because you can               |
| 31:14      | just take it somewhere and do something with it.                                                     |
| 31:18      | And it's not a big deal to do that.                                                                  |
| 31:21      | And also the battery life lasts a long time.                                                         |
| 31:23      | Yes, the battery life in the new MacBooks, it can last an exceptionally long time.                   |
| 31:26      | But if you haven't used it in a while, then I feel like in my experience, it's much more             |
| 31:30      | likely that the battery is going to be gone versus the iPad, which somehow seems to just             |
| 31:34      | keep going for ages, which is amazing.                                                               |
| 31:38      | I love that.                                                                                         |
| 31:39      | So yeah, I find it feels less like I have to do lots of work when I sit down with an                 |
| 31:48      | iPad, but when I sit down with an iPad to do work, I still feel like I can get a lot done,           |
| 31:53      | which it's a nice balance between the two with a little less stress and then plenty                  |
| 31:59      | of good solutions to various things there as well.                                                   |
| 32:05      | Text automation is another area where I find automation useful on iPad because I do so much          |
| 32:10      | writing there.                                                                                       |
| 32:11      | I feel like the [[Grammarly]] app on iPad has got a lot better in terms of doing the [[Grammarly]]           |
| 32:17      | bits where it goes through and tries to rewrite and fix text for you, and it can work in any         |
| 32:22      | app.                                                                                                 |
| 32:23      | And I really like the way they've kind of integrated it over the years.                              |
| 32:28      | So that's a good automation tool for me.                                                             |
| 32:31      | I mean, any type of text automation you can do, you know, fill-ins or text replacement,              |
| 32:37      | all that stuff works on iPad.                                                                        |
| 32:39      | Yes, yeah, it does.                                                                                  |
| 32:41      | And it's amazing how good this stuff can be as well.                                                 |
| 32:46      | You know, I've used a couple of apps over the years to do a whole bunch of automation                |
| 32:52      | things.                                                                                              |
| 32:53      | You know, I started out back in the day with [[Editorial]], and you know, [[Editorial]] was amazing.         |
| 32:59      | And obviously, well, I say obviously, I'm not using [[Editorial]] anymore.                               |
| 33:02      | I believe it is still on the App Store, but what I tend to be using for that is [[Textastic]].           |
| 33:12      | And [[Textastic]] is great because it's kind of like a miniature version of [[BBEdit]], but it's            |
| 33:18      | on the iPad.                                                                                         |
| 33:20      | But because of the way that you can just point it at an entire folder in [[iCloud]], and you             |
| 33:26      | can also have it run as a mini-servers for other devices to connect to, to look at things            |
| 33:33      | and so on, and it's got a terminal built-in, so if you're trying to edit something and               |
| 33:38      | upload it to a server, like it can do that and so on, it's pretty awesome.                           |
| 33:43      | And you know, it ties in as well with other apps that, you know, will allow you to get               |
| 33:49      | things done like working copy.                                                                       |
| 33:51      | So you know, that for me is really great.                                                            |
| 33:54      | And you know, it doesn't necessarily sound like it's automation related, but believe                 |
| 34:00      | it or not, using the correct like [[Text Encoding\|text encoding]], or not [[Text Encoding\|text encoding]], sorry, I've forgotten         |
| 34:08      | what it is.                                                                                          |
| 34:09      | But you know, when you open a file and different words are in different colours because they          |
| 34:11      | mean different things.                                                                               |
| 34:13      | [[Syntax Highlighting\|Syntax highlighting]].                                                                                 |
| 34:14      | [[Syntax Highlighting\|Syntax highlighting]].                                                                                 |
| 34:15      | Thank you, David.                                                                                    |
| 34:16      | I had one of those brain moments where I didn't have a brain, but [[Syntax Highlighting\|syntax highlighting]].               |
| 34:20      | And yeah, [[Syntax Highlighting\|syntax highlighting]] and not only [[Syntax Highlighting\|syntax highlighting]], but therefore the correct            |
| 34:25      | like autocomplete.                                                                                   |
| 34:27      | So when you type a certain kind of bracket, it automatically closes it and or it knows               |
| 34:33      | that this tag has already been closed or something like that.                                        |
| 34:37      | That is automation, okay?                                                                            |
| 34:39      | If you've got the right app that actually helps you with things like that and make sure              |
| 34:42      | that you can, you know, see what it is that you need to do because you are writing a [[JSON]]            |
| 34:47      | file, for example, or you're editing a [[JSON]] file and you just, you know, you mess around             |
| 34:51      | with it a little bit and it seems okay.                                                              |
| 34:54      | But then actually when, you know, if you if you had a bigger screen to look at it, you               |
| 34:59      | might see that it wasn't okay.                                                                       |
| 35:01      | But with [[Syntax Highlighting\|syntax highlighting]], even on say an iPad mini screen, it can highlight it and               |
| 35:06      | be like, Hey, let's go again to line.                                                                |
| 35:07      | There's something wrong here.                                                                        |
| 35:08      | You'll need to fix this, which is really great.                                                      |
| 35:11      | You know, I was going through this and prepped for the show and I know one app that I don't          |
| 35:16      | automate or particularly use on iPad.                                                                |
| 35:20      | And I think this is kind of a platform limitation.                                                   |
| 35:22      | It's [[Obsidian]].                                                                                       |
| 35:23      | You know, [[Obsidian]] has a perfectly adequate iPad app, but I just don't like the way every            |
| 35:28      | time I load it up, it has to catch up with data.                                                     |
| 35:31      | It doesn't look like an iPad app at all.                                                             |
| 35:35      | And it does have automation available to it, but I find when it comes to [[Obsidian]], I do              |
| 35:40      | it on a laptop or a desktop computer and I don't do it on an iPad.                                   |
| 35:44      | It's just, I guess it's a quirky thing about me.                                                     |
| 35:47      | Yes, perhaps.                                                                                        |
| 35:49      | But at the same time, I will give a shout out to a little app called [[Actions for Obsidian]],           |
| 35:56      | which can allow easier automation of [[Obsidian]] on iPhone and iPad because it specifically             |
| 36:03      | [[Shortcuts]] actions for [[Obsidian]].                                                                      |
| 36:06      | And it connects specifically to the [[Obsidian]] like vault folder on your device.                       |
| 36:13      | And then you need to enable community plugins and the actions you are I, and then it will            |
| 36:19      | do magic.                                                                                            |
| 36:20      | Like, I don't exactly know how it works underneath the hood, but it works pretty well.               |
| 36:26      | And I have to say when I've been using it for, you know, automating with [[Obsidian]], then              |
| 36:33      | I have definitely found it to work exceptionally well.                                               |
| 36:38      | Any other favourite automations on iPad?                                                              |
| 36:40      | I mean, it's so difficult to say, David, because one of the things that I have, you know, really     |
| 36:45      | tried to do over a time is just like, you know, narrow this down so that I don't have                |
| 36:51      | too many things happening in too many places.                                                        |
| 36:54      | But at the same time, I do reach for my iPad for just so many things, whether it's, you              |
| 36:58      | know, accessing and editing my [[Home Assistant]] setup.                                                 |
| 37:01      | So I do use my iPad for [[Home Assistant]] or, you know, messing around with, you know, [[Scriptable]],      |
| 37:09      | for example, that's one we haven't talked about today, but both of us have definitely                |
| 37:12      | used and I'm still using, you know, it's, there's so many things I'm doing.                          |
| 37:17      | It's hard to put an exact list of exactly what I'm doing together, but I will continue               |
| 37:25      | to have a look.                                                                                      |
| 37:26      | And if there's anything else we can always talk about it in a follow up episode.                     |
| 37:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 37:30      | And I think the theme that came out of today is look at the way you're using the iPad and            |
| 37:35      | then look at automation routines that make sense for that.                                           |
| 37:39      | I feel like personally for me, a lot of them are text related and kind of setup type related         |
| 37:46      | stuff, you know, setting up files and various apps.                                                  |
| 37:49      | So long as they're supported on iPad and [[Shortcuts]], I can do a lot of that kind of what I would      |
| 37:54      | consider busy work sitting at my iPad on the couch.                                                  |
| 37:58      | And I really like that.                                                                              |
| 38:00      | So I can save the time spent at my desk to actually, you know, do the work as opposed                |
| 38:06      | to fiddle with setting things up.                                                                    |
| 38:08      | And the iPad has really found a comfortable place for me in that way.                                |
| 38:11      | And as a result, most of my automations are aimed in that direction.                                 |
| 38:16      | And Rose gave me some great ideas today about screen setups and [[Stage Manager]]                      |
| 38:21      | so I'm going to be checking into that as well.                                                          |
| 38:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 38:24      | That's definitely something that once you figure out what it is that you want or need,               |
| 38:30      | it's a lot easier to play with it than it is just kind of like as an abstract thing.                 |
| 38:35      | And for me, the difficult part there was definitely taking the time to figure out what it was I      |
| 38:39      | actually wanted and needed.                                                                          |
| 38:42      | You know, and I am just going to finish the section by giving a shout out to two apps                |
| 38:47      | that I've only just started playing with.                                                            |
| 38:49      | So I can't really talk a lot about yet, but [[Pyto]], P-Y-T-O and [[Rubyist]] are both recent               |
| 38:55      | additions to my iPad.                                                                                |
| 38:57      | So I'm going to be playing with those and talking about those more on a future show.                 |
| 39:01      | Well, can you give us a brief summary of what they do?                                               |
| 39:04      | Well, [[Pyto]] is for writing [[Python]] and [[Rubyist]] is for writing [[Ruby]].                                   |
| 39:07      | So these are definitely more off of the nerdy end, I will admit that.                                |
| 39:15      | But at the same time, yeah, they are good options to have if you would like to break                 |
| 39:22      | out of [[Shortcuts]] and get more into writing some actual code.                                         |
| 39:28      | And maybe something like [[Jellycuts]], which recently went open source I should note, isn't            |

| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome the Automators. I'm David Sparks,                                                                |
| 00:04      | and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                                                              |
| 00:06      | And this is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.                 |
| 00:10      | Hi, Rose. Hey, David, how are you?                                                                       |
| 00:13      | Excellent. Looking forward to the show, we've got a lot of listeners that have written in                |
| 00:19      | talking about [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] and automation, and both of us have been playing with it. I'd say beyond               |
| 00:26      | dipping our toes, I think we're kind of in up to our necks. But [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] is a great kind of new               |
| 00:32      | thought in a personal knowledge management. There's a lot of opportunities for automation                |
| 00:37      | in there to make it more useful, and we were going to tackle that today.                                 |
| 00:41      | Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's one of those things where if you're there going, okay,                     |
| 00:44      | I've heard [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], I've heard [[Personal Knowledge Management]], what is this? And or you've seen               |
| 00:50      | like the idea of it, and it's kind of a personal wiki. You might be there going, I mean, I don't         |
| 00:55      | know, like, do I really need this? And it's one of those things where I feel like you have to find       |
| 01:02      | the right use cases for you and for your life, because maybe you don't need this. But I have             |
| 01:08      | found this to just be an incredibly useful resource for myself. So for example, I have                   |
| 01:15      | documented some parts of my network setup at home, because I have certain things set up certain          |
| 01:20      | ways, like I've got my ISP provider router, and then I've got my stuff but sitting behind that           |
| 01:24      | with my wifi and everything. And knowing what settings I have set on the ISP provider router,            |
| 01:30      | like, you think, eh, like, you know, how important is that? Well, the other day,                         |
| 01:34      | I was having internet problems. And because I apparently am the only person in this precise              |
| 01:38      | area that works from home during the middle of the day, my ISP was 100% note, this is your problem,      |
| 01:43      | this is not an us problem, this is a you personally problem, we're going to send you a new router to     |
| 01:48      | fix it. And I was like, okay, cool. Well, I got the new router and I had to set it up and I just         |
| 01:54      | opened, in my case, [[Obsidian]], and I had the info there of what I changed and why I changed it as         |
| 01:59      | well, not just so that I could copy paste it over, but because I actually knew why things were there.    |
| 02:05      | And that is that sort of like ended up being my starting point, you know, what things have I done        |
| 02:11      | in my life and why have I done them so that then if I need to look back at this later for myself         |
| 02:15      | or for somebody else, I have that information. And starting with, you know, technical things             |
| 02:21      | really is what made it click for me. But of course, there are the people who, you know,                  |
| 02:25      | like to start with, you know, a little family tree and bits of information about other people            |
| 02:29      | as a place to start. I don't know what your starting point for this was, David, I'm sure there was one.  |
| 02:34      | Well, I think you really hit a good point in that I think that the common idea around [[Personal Knowledge Management]]   |
| 02:40      | is like, you're writing your PhD thesis and you want to collect all your            |
| 02:45      | research and you've got to have it all organised and index so you can do a good job. But I think         |
| 02:50      | that's a that's one application of personal knowledge management technology. But there's a lot           |
| 02:57      | in just normal life, like, like you were talking about just managing your technology, I have a           |
| 03:02      | similar one, because I have an ancient audio device that's analog, and it has [[DIP Switch\|DIP Switches]] in the back.  |
| 03:10      | And once I got them set right, I took a picture of it and put it in my [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] system. So if things          |
| 03:16      | ever get out of whack, I can always just look at that picture and reset the [[DIP Switch\|DIPs]]. But I also have        |
| 03:22      | a note for my dog, you know, and when I go to the vet, I've got a list of the medications she's          |
| 03:27      | taken and the problem she's had. So when the vet asks me a question, I can answer, I even have,          |
| 03:33      | like, test results and some PDFs in there. So I can just give them to her right there.                   |
| 03:38      | And, you know, there's all of us have these bits of information. I have them with respect to my          |
| 03:43      | kids. And, you know, we're all responsible for all this information. And as automators,                  |
| 03:49      | we want to have the information available to us, but we don't want it to become                          |
| 03:53      | this massive cognitive load to carry it. And I think that's where [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] can step in, especially            |
| 03:58      | if you include automation, you can make it a simple thing to create but easy to access.                  |
| 04:04      | And that's what we'd like to talk about today. I guess we should mention, though, there is a             |
| 04:09      | good friend of ours on the internet who has really taken on the idea of [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] pretty seriously. And        |
| 04:15      | that's our pal, [[Mike Schmitz]]. Yeah, you're a co-host over on [[Focused]], which is a great podcast           |
| 04:22      | of people are looking for, you know, the sort of productivity angle for things. You know,                |
| 04:27      | [[Mac Power Users]] is how do I technically, Automators, how do I automatically and [[Focused]],                 |
| 04:33      | how do I productively? And it's a nice trio that you've got there. It'll be sad                          |
| 04:37      | then we don't have Automators, but that's okay, because we'll pull it into [[Mac Power Users]] as            |
| 04:42      | needed. But [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike]] has put a whole bunch of things together for this. And I'm also going to link           |
| 04:48      | one of his articles, which is an intro to [[Personal Knowledge Management]] that he wrote for [the Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com),      |
| 04:52      | because I feel like that's quite a good place to sort of get started with this. But at            |
| 04:56      | the same time, you know, if you've got notes that you reference on a regular basis, congratulations,     |
| 05:00      | you have a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system, you just didn't know it. Or maybe you did,              |
| 05:05      | but that's okay. Yeah. And another thing [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike]] has done, if you really want it just kind of soup          |
| 05:11      | the nuts, he has a product that's at [practicalpkm.com](https://practicalpkm.com). That's kind of his home for this stuff.          |
| 05:16      | And it's [practicalpkm.com/lifehq](https://practicalpkm.com/lifehq), where he's built an [[Obsidian]] vault that is a                   |
| 05:24      | [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] system that you can just install and have it built for you. So [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike's]] got some great ideas           |
| 05:30      | and thoughts on it. So you can check that out. But there, you know, I think this [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] thing is a          |
| 05:35      | relatively new concept, we've had wikis forever. But it seems like in the last three or four years     |
| 05:41      | that it's really become a thing where, you know, normal users have started to think, well, why           |
| 05:46      | not use linking and kind of this new notes technology to build a system where I can quickly              |
| 05:53      | grasp the router settings or the dogs vaccinations. And you can do that. But there's a lot of            |
| 06:00      | tools for it. The first time it really came to my front of mind was as Rome research launched.           |
| 06:07      | And that's not a tool that I ended up using. It was web based. I didn't really care for their            |
| 06:12      | data model. But it was one of the first kind of like [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] linked thinking tools.                          |
| 06:19      | Yeah, yeah, I feel like [[Roam Research\|Roam]] and [[Obsidian]] started becoming very popular at the same time.                |
| 06:25      | And, you know, I, I've always been very hesitant to use web only things. I guess this comes back         |
| 06:31      | from when I used to travel a lot. And I was never guaranteed to have an Internet connection.             |
| 06:36      | And having something that relies on having an Internet connection, like for example,                     |
| 06:40      | [[Notion]], which is a great tool, is still something that I'm not super keen on. Because,                   |
| 06:45      | you know, if your Internet goes down, or there's just a problem connecting to that website,              |
| 06:50      | or whatever, then you get into a little bit of trouble because you can't access your information.        |
| 06:55      | And the whole point of a personal knowledge system of whatever kind it is, is that you,                  |
| 07:00      | you've saved this information for yourself to use, and not being able to access that is kind of          |
| 07:06      | defeats the point of it. So I mean, I personally ended up settling on predominantly, but not             |
| 07:12      | exclusively [[Obsidian]] for my things. But there is a whole bunch of options out there, including           |
| 07:17      | just basic [[Apple Notes]], which is really great. Yeah, well, I would say that both Rose and I are,         |
| 07:22      | are lean towards [[Obsidian]] for a lot of reasons. The data model is really simple. It stores               |
| 07:28      | [[Markdown]] files on your drive. So you own the data. They're syncing engine is end-to-end encrypted.       |
| 07:34      | So you've got some protection. And it is so customisable. I mean, every time you open                    |
| 07:41      | [[Obsidian]], there are new plugins available. And it's got this very active community.                      |
| 07:45      | We're in this kind of infancy of [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] tools, and it seems like there's a new one every week.              |
| 07:51      | And you want to avoid the new and shiny until they've proven their staying power and [[Obsidian]]            |
| 07:57      | has absolutely done that. It's got a huge user base, and it's not going anywhere. But there,             |
| 08:02      | there are others. I think a really nice one is [[NotePlan]]. It's a, it's a native app for                   |
| 08:09      | [[Apple]] stuff. So if you're on Windows, it's not going to be any fun. But you know,                        |
| 08:13      | I think it's kind of like [[Obsidian]] light. It really does have a lot of the [[Obsidian]] tools,               |
| 08:18      | but not all of them. Clearly not the, the plugin stuff. It's not multi-platform,                         |
| 08:24      | but it does save [[Markdown]] files to your drive. And if you kind of want that native experience,           |
| 08:28      | you're willing to give a few features. That's worth checking out. [[Apple Notes]], like Rose said,           |
| 08:32      | I think is hugely useful. And I'm going to talk about that in a minute.                                  |
| 08:36      | [[NotePlan]] is a really, really good tool. It's a really good tool. It's a really good tool.                |
| 08:41      | I'm going to talk about that in a minute. [[Notion]] to me, I don't really view that as a [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] app.           |
| 08:47      | I know there's people that do it. If you look at YouTube, there's a whole bunch of people that           |
| 08:50      | have made a career on YouTube about how they run their whole life out of [[Notion]]. But like Rose,          |
| 08:56      | I don't like the data model. I don't like that you have to be online for it to work. I am a             |
| 09:01      | [[Notion]] enthusiast, but just for collaborative projects that I have to do with other people.              |
| 09:07      | I mean, we're reading this outline out of [[Notion]] right now. And I would say [[Notion]] is much better        |
| 09:14      | at two of us making a podcast outline than [[Obsidian]] is. So you got to kind of choose the                 |
| 09:20      | right tool for the right job. And I don't really see [[Notion]] as a particularly good [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] tool.             |
| 09:26      | But that's just my opinion. I know other people would disagree.                                          |
| 09:30      | Yeah. I think a lot of this stuff kind of probably started with [[nvALT]] and what's now the                 |
| 09:39      | replacement [[nvUltra]], which is from [[Brett Terpstra]]. [[nvUltra]], to be clear, is still in private beta.       |
| 09:46      | So you can sign up. I'll put a link to the website there. But that's where the idea of just              |
| 09:51      | save [[Markdown]] files, look at [[Markdown]] files to find information. Ta-da. Or at least that for me          |
| 09:57      | is where they're originated. And for me, that has expanded over time to include more than just           |
| 10:03      | markdown files. I've got PDF saved in there. I've got images saved in there. I've got code files         |
| 10:08      | saved in there as references of how to do this thing or that thing. Because there are things             |
| 10:13      | that I will need to essentially use more or less as a template for other things. And [[Personal Knowledge Management]]    |
| 10:20      | is really basically, I'm putting this here so that I can find it when I             |
| 10:24      | need it again. And it's more about the, or not more about, it's about the structure and the              |
| 10:30      | ability to find the information that you want rather than necessarily that everything is perfectly       |
| 10:38      | typeset and laid out and so on. File structures and folder structures are a really great idea,           |
| 10:44      | but you don't have to make them complicated in someone to find them as long as you can                   |
| 10:48      | to put your notes in. As long as you can find your notes or whatever it is that you're looking for       |
| 10:53      | when you need it, you're winning. Which, you know, I think that was another thing for me where I was     |
| 10:58      | there trying to figure out, you know, like, well, folders do I need? And like, how am I going to         |
| 11:02      | structure things? And then I decided, you know what, I'm going to forget all of that. And I'm just       |
| 11:06      | going to dump everything in a folder. And I started literally by just dumping a whole bunch of [[Markdown]]  |
| 11:11      | files in a single folder. And I realised, okay, well, these five files very clearly belong together      |
| 11:15      | and under this heading. And so I grouped them together under that heading and put them in a              |
| 11:21      | folder. And from there, I just kind of let my structure evolve organically,                              |
| 11:27      | which for me works much better than sitting down in advance and trying to figure out, you know,          |
| 11:31      | like 80 levels deep of where does this need to go and so on and so forth.                                |
| 11:34      | Yeah. Well, one of the other leaders in this is Nick Milo with [linking your thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com), which is a         |
| 11:40      | course he's been teaching for years about how to use these tools to kind of develop thought.             |
| 11:46      | And then that really does open up kind of the question of [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] versus thinking tools. And that's          |
| 11:53      | just the term I use. I don't know if that's a thing anybody else uses, but I do think there's            |
| 11:57      | a difference like, like getting back to the example earlier of planning your PhD. That's                 |
| 12:03      | different than planning, you know, your veterinary visit or changing your router. And I would argue      |
| 12:11      | that you should think about them separately. Now they could all be in one tool, but maybe they           |
| 12:15      | shouldn't. Yeah. And I think that is, you know, that that's where you kind of have to figure             |
| 12:21      | out where the lines get drawn. You know, do you do you mind that work and personal things are in         |
| 12:25      | the same system together? Or do you actually want them separated? So I personally tend to use [[Obsidian]]   |
| 12:31      | for most of the, like the notes that I have. Other things will live in, live in [[DEVONthink]],             |
| 12:37      | and we'll come back to that. But I have two [[Obsidian]] vaults. I also have two [[DEVONthink]] vaults.         |
| 12:41      | But [[Drafts]], I don't, I mean, I could have two, two separate icon accounts, but that gets very            |
| 12:47      | messy very quickly because then you have to try and transfer stuff from one to the other. So I           |
| 12:51      | just have everything in [[Drafts]] and I use tags for anything that I need to separate out until it then     |
| 12:56      | goes off to live in the right place. If it's a thing that is going to live on, if it's not,              |
| 13:00      | then I don't necessarily put it there. And you have to figure out, you know, where do you want           |
| 13:05      | the dividing lines? Do you want your dividing lines to be very clearly strictly between projects,        |
| 13:10      | just between areas of your life? Or do you really not mind? And is everything kind of messy and          |
| 13:14      | blurry together anyway? Because, I mean, at least for me, there's some stuff from work that bleeds       |
| 13:18      | over into personal because little snippets of code that I've written, you know, like a little            |
| 13:22      | command or series of commands that I use for work, I might want that for personal as well. So I have     |
| 13:27      | to figure out a place where I can put that working access it for both. And that that's something that,   |
| 13:32      | you know, is, is worth wearing in mind if that's what you just have to figure out where you want         |
| 13:37      | your lines if you want lines. Yeah, it's been an evolution for me too. I like when I first started       |
| 13:43      | with [[Obsidian]], I was an early adopter, it's a great app. You're gonna, if you spend any time             |
| 13:49      | with it, there's so many people that get hooked on [[Obsidian]]. But the, I did everything in it in          |
| 13:55      | my vault. And then I started to see downsides to that. I didn't like kind of like, I keep using          |
| 14:01      | the veterinary note, but that's a good example. I didn't like that being mixed in with my thoughts       |
| 14:05      | on justice, you know, because I've got like, what I call kind of *Sparky OS*, this the deep thought        |
| 14:10      | kind of stuff, my personal operating system in there. But I also had the, the projects I was             |
| 14:17      | doing, whether it's the next field guide or the next podcast or whatever, and there as well. But         |
| 14:23      | now over the course of years that has evolved a bit, I have pulled out the personal, what I would        |
| 14:30      | call [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], the kind of true [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], like the vet notes and the picture of the audio interface, that's        |
| 14:36      | all in [[Apple Notes]] now. And it's very easy for me to understand the personal stuff and things            |
| 14:41      | like that go in Apple notes. And at the same time, I've evolved to where the teams I'm on are largely    |
| 14:49      | using [[Notion]]. So it didn't make sense to have a MacSparky field guide project in both [[Obsidian]] and      |
| 14:56      | [[Notion]], because then you've got the risk that the data is going to be inconsistent. And, you know,       |
| 15:01      | the other person isn't going to see what you're updating in [[Obsidian]]. So a lot of the MacSparky         |
| 15:07      | management has gone into [[Notion]]. And [[Obsidian]] has remained as like my serious thought tool,              |
| 15:14      | you know, the thing I put when I read things that are serious. And whether it's me thinking              |
| 15:19      | about something I want to write in the future, or like deeper thoughts about productivity, and           |
| 15:24      | just like all this stuff that like serious thoughts, I guess I'll say, you know, and it's                |
| 15:29      | where I put my book notes, you know, because I have read wise feed me book notes. And so it's            |
| 15:34      | kind of where I do my heavy thinking. But I have ended up with three tools in essence. And I'm not       |
| 15:40      | still exactly sure about the balance of the MacSparky stuff. Like, do I put it all in [[Notion]]?           |
| 15:46      | I'm not really sure I like that. But because I'm not as big of a fan of [[Notion]] as I am of something      |
| 15:51      | that's local with [[Markdown]] files like [[Obsidian]]. But I'm evolving a bit on it. But but I have             |
| 15:57      | really kind of got to three buckets where I used to have just one. Yeah, I'm still very much in          |
| 16:04      | a three buckets sort of system. I have [[Drafts]]. And [[Drafts]] is essentially for things that are not         |
| 16:10      | going to live for very long. So for example, I pick up a user story at work, that would be               |
| 16:14      | something like a new feature to implement. And as I'm going on with that, I'll make notes about it       |
| 16:20      | in [[Drafts]] and so on. But then once that thing is done, and it's delivered, and the testers have          |
| 16:25      | stopped throwing it back at me, because of course that happens, then that note just                      |
| 16:29      | gets deleted. And that's it, it's gone. And so, you know, there's some things that are in [[Drafts]].        |
| 16:34      | And then [[Obsidian]] is for stuff that is going to basically just live for a long time. But I wrote         |
| 16:40      | it myself, and I'm going to continue to edit it. It's a living breathing, but living with, you           |
| 16:46      | know, the intention of being a bit more than, you know, just a flower that will disappear relatively     |
| 16:51      | soon document. And then Dev and Think is for this is a thing, it exists. It's almost certainly not       |
| 16:59      | going to change. There probably are things in [[DEVONthink]] that should change, but things like my       |
| 17:04      | washing machine manual. And if I have a link to a web page from [[Obsidian]], I have been bitten              |
| 17:14      | relatively recently, actually, by a web page that I had linked to in [[Obsidian]] for reference,              |
| 17:19      | no longer existing. So I now save any web pages that I would like to reference into [[DEVONthink]].       |
| 17:24      | I also submit them to [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) over at [archive.org](https://archive.org) as well. But then I have, then I'm          |
| 17:30      | starting to link to the [[DEVONthink]] version of the web page for those things so that when I go to       |
| 17:35      | come back to it, and I look at the thing that I said, hey, this is a good reference for how this         |
| 17:39      | works, then I don't get bitten by this website no longer exists, or they've changed everything and       |
| 17:44      | the link doesn't work anymore. So I have three buckets, but it's more for me the lifespan of             |
| 17:51      | the document versus and the editability of it versus, you know, areas of my life.                        |
| 17:57      | Yeah, I'm going to put a pin in drafts. I want to talk about that in a minute. But I should have         |
| 18:02      | mentioned I also, there is a matching [[DEVONthink]] database to match my [[Obsidian]] one. And               |
| 18:09      | there's just one of each that I don't have multiples, but they're all cross linked because               |
| 18:14      | although you can put resource files into your [[Obsidian]] vaults, because of the nature of the              |
| 18:22      | application, syncing becomes, I think, a problem if you get too much in there. And I, you know,          |
| 18:27      | [[DEVONthink]] is just so good at managing like PDFs and anything other than text really,                 |
| 18:33      | that I just have kind of married the two, and I use the best features of both of them. So                |
| 18:42      | the [[Obsidian]] vault has many, many links to documents that are stored in the [[DEVONthink]]                |
| 18:46      | and vice versa. In fact, the other thing I do is I index the [[Obsidian]] vault because it's a folder        |
| 18:53      | full [[Markdown]] files in [[DEVONthink]] so I can access it there if I want. It doesn't get you              |
| 18:59      | all the [[Obsidian]] bells and whistles, but I've found it, it's fine if I really need it. But               |
| 19:04      | generally text for me is [[Obsidian]] and everything else is [[DEVONthink]] for that part of my stack.        |
| 19:10      | Yeah, being able to index your, you know, your, your vault of text files in [[DEVONthink]] is,            |
| 19:18      | it's a really nice thing to be able to do. I personally have not done that just because                  |
| 19:23      | I've not yet found a case where I've been searching for [[DEVONthink]] and then thought that,             |
| 19:28      | and then realised that it was an [[Obsidian]]. But that is absolutely something that you could do            |
| 19:33      | if you wanted to. I've just, yeah, I've not found a need for that just yet. And I'm trying to keep       |
| 19:42      | all of these places as lean as possible. So not adding or duplicating information. Now,                  |
| 19:49      | in this case, because it would be reading the folder that I have for [[Obsidian]], you know,                 |
| 19:54      | there wouldn't be a potential case for, I've updated this in [[Obsidian]], but the updated version           |
| 19:59      | isn't yet in [[DEVONthink]], that shouldn't happen because [[DEVONthink]] is just on my                    |
| 20:02      | Mac, it's always running. But yeah, the last thing I want with any of my systems is to have              |
| 20:08      | duplicate information, which means that if information goes from, say, [[Drafts]] into [[Obsidian]]              |
| 20:13      | or into [[DEVONthink]] or something, then I delete it from [[Drafts]]. And if I'm, if I put something         |
| 20:19      | from [[Obsidian]] into [[DEVONthink]], I delete it from [[Obsidian]]. If I move it, then it is moving,            |
| 20:24      | it is not a copy. And that's something that I try to be really careful of because there's nothing        |
| 20:28      | worse than looking at a note that you've made for yourself that explains how the thing works.            |
| 20:33      | And then you're looking at it and going, but it doesn't work. I don't understand only to find out.       |
| 20:38      | Oh, right. The reason why it doesn't work is because this is the old version. I need the                 |
| 20:43      | new version, you know, underscore final, underscore final, final.                                        |
| 20:50      | This episode of the Automators Podcast is brought to you by the Data Citizens Dialogues Podcast,         |
| 20:56      | unpacking the importance of data and its impact on the world. As a listener of the automators,           |
| 21:02      | you're probably serious about data. So assuming you are interested in data,                              |
| 21:07      | especially about the way it continues to shape our world, you need to check out the Data Citizens        |
| 21:12      | Dialogues, a forward-thinking show brought to you by the folks at Calibre, the leader in data            |
| 21:18      | intelligence. I really like the way this show is structured. They bring in experts from the field        |
| 21:25      | and they're interviewed by people who have specific knowledge of what they're talking about. So          |
| 21:29      | it's a very informative show. You'll hear firsthand from industry titans, innovators,                    |
| 21:35      | and executives from some of the world's largest companies as they dive into the hottest topics           |
| 21:40      | in data. And you'll get insight to everything from popular staples such as AI governance and             |
| 21:46      | data sharing down to more nuanced questions like how do we ensure data readability at a global scale.    |
| 21:53      | I recently listened to the September 2024 episode called Metadata Magic, The Path to Data Enlightenment. |
| 22:02      | In it, host Karen and guest Tanya talked a lot about metadata management and how it can help             |
| 22:08      | empower the organisation. Rose and I often talk about the importance of metadata with automation.        |
| 22:15      | That's also true in big data, perhaps even more so. Tanya shared the program's mission to democratise    |
| 22:22      | data, the importance of stakeholder management, and the role of continuous improvisation                 |
| 22:27      | in maintaining the program's success. Getting a metadata repository started early can make all           |
| 22:33      | the difference down the road as you work with big data. I'm not an expert in the field, but the          |
| 22:39      | podcast really brought me right along. I felt like I understood everything they were talking about,      |
| 22:44      | and I had a better understanding of the use of metadata in these large data implementations.             |
| 22:50      | While data may be shaping our world, Data Citizen's Dialogues is shaping the conversation. Follow        |

| 23:01      | Our thanks to Data Citizen's Dialogues for their support of the Automator's Podcast and all of Relay.     |
| 23:11      | Let me just talk about [[Drafts]], then. I use it similar. To me, [[Drafts]] is the catch-all for                |
| 23:16      | all of these things. Let's get into the automation discussion in general. I think we both explained      |
| 23:23      | why we like [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKMs]] and why they're useful, but automation can make it so much more useful,                 |
| 23:28      | because the downside of a [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] system is the generation of it. How do you create this data?               |
| 23:36      | How much time do you spend on it? It's great that you can access it, but you have to put it in there     |
| 23:41      | for that to exist. That's where automation can really come handy. For me, [[Drafts]] is                      |
| 23:48      | kind of, like I said, the catch-all. This morning, I had a doctor appointment. As I'm walking out,       |
| 23:53      | I sat down on a bench, opened up drafts, and dictated a quick note. Now, it's in [[Drafts]].                 |
| 24:00      | That, for me, is the type of information that goes into an Apple note on medical notes.                  |
| 24:06      | It doesn't go into [[Obsidian]], but it was in [[Drafts]]. I could have gone straight into [[Apple Notes]],          |
| 24:11      | but it's kind of fiddly with formatting and getting it in the right place.                               |
| 24:15      | And [[Drafts]] is the catch-all. It's like it's so fast to capture something in [[Drafts]] that that's why       |
| 24:23      | I use it. And going further down the road, you can put a widget on your screen. There's a million        |
| 24:28      | ways you can make it even faster, and I just find that really useful. And then part of my                |
| 24:35      | routine is just to go through the [[Drafts]] inbox. I mean, we've talked, another thing I do is I use        |
| 24:40      | my Apple Watch, and I dictate into [[Whisper Memos]], which automatically sends anything I say to [[Drafts]].    |
| 24:47      | So I just go to [Drafts]], and that stuff is there. But just like Rose, I don't use [Drafts]] as an            |
| 24:53      | entire text management system, although you can. [[Greg Pierce\|Greg]] has made it very powerful. A lot of people         |
| 24:58      | do that. To me, it's a halfway house. I mean, the text is going to go somewhere. It might go into        |
| 25:04      | [[Obsidian]]. It might go into [[Apple Notes\|Notes]]. It might go into a [[Notion]] outline. It might go into an email.          |
| 25:10      | There's all these different things you can do with it from there. But I find there's no faster           |
| 25:15      | way to capture text that I may want to drop into, among other things, a [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] system.                      |
| 25:22      | Yeah. And I think that is, for me, the point where any and all automation needs to start.                |
| 25:28      | I need to be able to capture information as quickly and as easily as possible,                           |
| 25:32      | which means that if it is anything text-based, anything at all that's text-based, I am going             |
| 25:38      | to be starting almost certainly in [[Drafts]]. Every so often, I might be like, okay, well,                  |
| 25:43      | there's going to be a whole bunch of information. This is going to live in obsidian. I might start       |
| 25:46      | by creating a new document in [[Obsidian]]. But usually, I will start in [[Drafts]] and get all the              |
| 25:52      | things out of my head. And then from there, I'll massage it a little bit, perhaps first,                 |
| 25:57      | or maybe I'll just be like, okay, well, I've got the information out of my head. I've got the            |
| 26:00      | things that I was trying to capture, cool, send this over to [[Obsidian]], figure out how I'm going to       |
| 26:06      | name it, where I'm going to put it, and so on and so forth, and then go from there. And yeah,            |
| 26:12      | I tend to just start in [[Drafts]] because the dictation on it is so good. And it also,                      |
| 26:19      | which can be quite useful actually sometimes, I've found every so often, David, I've left a note to      |
| 26:24      | myself in [[Drafts]]. Okay, and I've written something down, or I've, you know, I've dictated something,     |
| 26:32      | but something somewhere along the way went a little awry. Not sure exactly what, not sure                |
| 26:37      | exactly how, but like, there's a word missing, or maybe where I was dictating, something got,            |
| 26:42      | you know, transposed. So a word that should have been this ended up being that. And it doesn't           |
| 26:47      | quite make sense being able to look in [[Drafts]] at like, when you created this, and where you              |
| 26:52      | created this, so you've got that location history, you would not believe how often that has actually     |
| 26:56      | helped me. So, you know, drafts for capture for me has been incredibly useful. So yeah, I do love        |
| 27:03      | [[Drafts]] as a capture system. And, you know, it does have the options to use backlinks and all of          |
| 27:07      | those other things as well, which are all in the user guide for [[Drafts]]. And I can pop a link to that     |
| 27:13      | in the, in the show notes, because you can use it as a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system.             |
| 27:17      | But for me, from there, I do tend to go to [[Obsidian]] just because as amazing as [[Drafts]]                    |
| 27:24      | is for automating, I like having the ephemeral in [[Drafts]] and the more permanent, not permanent,          |
| 27:33      | permanent, but more permanent things in [[Obsidian]], just so that there's a nice mental divide.             |
| 27:37      | Yeah. And so let's talk about that capture to [[Obsidian]]. And I'm going to also say [[NotePlan]],               |
| 27:42      | because it's another app that just looks at a folder full of [[Markdown]] files on your drive.               |
| 27:48      | That makes it very handy for automation, because any automation tool we talked about in the show,        |
| 27:55      | from [[AppleScript]] to [[Shortcuts]] to [[Keyboard Maestro]] to almost any automation you can think of,            |
| 28:02      | can write a text file and save it on your drive. And that's true on almost every platform. And,          |
| 28:10      | and so you've got this great opportunity now to automate the generation of notes in these tools,         |
| 28:16      | because all you have to do is create a text file and it's there. You don't have to monkey around         |
| 28:21      | with the interface. You know, they, these apps have like built in tag systems and all sorts of           |
| 28:26      | cool stuff. I mean, [[Obsidian]] is, is [[Markdown]], but it also has additional syntax, which can be         |
| 28:32      | easily written into this text file, whether it's your [[Front Matter\|front matter]] or your links or whatever.            |
| 28:37      | So I have written many automations over the years where like, if I have a new project,                   |
| 28:43      | I can just push a button and [[Shortcuts]] slash [[Keyboard Maestro]] slash whatever can generate                |
| 28:49      | that text file and just save it on my drive to the [[Obsidian]] folder in the appropriate vault              |
| 28:55      | in the appropriate folder. And it's just there waiting for me. And that makes it so easy to              |
| 29:00      | capture and create stuff. Yes. Yeah. And I think that that is, you know, that is always the key          |
| 29:06      | with a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system. It has to be easy to get stuff in, and it has to be         |
| 29:10      | easy to find stuff when you need it. Because if you are looking for something and you cannot find it,    |
| 29:17      | and you know, you wrote it, or you know, you've stored this information. So say, for example,            |
| 29:22      | I'm looking for my washing machine manual, and I know I've saved it, but I can't find it.                |
| 29:28      | That that's a problem, because then I have to try and find the washing machine manual again              |
| 29:31      | online, which depending on the age of the device and so on may not be possible and so on and so          |
| 29:36      | forth. You know, there's a reason why we save this information or why we want to save this               |
| 29:40      | information. So being able to find it is really important, but being able to capture it quickly          |
| 29:46      | and then easily, you know, modify it, edit it and so on is also really, really key.                      |
| 29:52      | Yeah. So I think that one of the big selling points of a tool like [[Obsidian]] into a lesser                |
| 29:59      | extent, [[NotePlan]] is just the ubiquity of automation, because it's just so easy, like and the same goes    |
| 30:06      | for attachments, by the way, like I said earlier, I like to keep PDFs in Dev and think, but you could    |
| 30:11      | also just move a PDF to a folder in your [[Obsidian]] data bank, and it's going to it's going to show up.    |
| 30:18      | But I prefer to do that with D[[DEVONthink]], but it's really easy to automate the stuff.                  |
| 30:23      | One tip, however, is always make sure you save the file extension consistent with the way the            |
| 30:28      | application is looking for. By default [[Obsidian]] is looking for a [[Markdown]] file, so you need to save      |
| 30:34      | it as `.md`. I think [[NotePlan]] is `.txt`, but you can change it in the settings. But I mean, when people         |
| 30:41      | start automating this, I get, I've got those emails saying, Oh, you had a great idea. I created          |
| 30:46      | automation, but the files aren't showing up in the app. And nine times out of 10, it's because           |
| 30:50      | they saved it as the wrong extension type. So just make sure and you can do this in [[Shortcuts]],           |
| 30:56      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] or whatever to change the extension to `.md` to make sure it actually shows up.            |
| 31:02      | Yeah, there are a couple of settings which can be quite useful to have a little look at inside           |
| 31:09      | of [[Obsidian]]. And there is one of them, for example, for making sure that all files show up               |
| 31:14      | regardless of the file type. And that is that is one of the options. So detect all file extensions       |
| 31:20      | is the name of that preference. And it's under files and links, because that can be quite useful,        |
| 31:24      | especially if you're using attachments, because while [[Obsidian]] is a [[Markdown]] editor, it does             |
| 31:31      | support attachments. So you can have images and PDFs and so on embedded in your files. And that's        |
| 31:38      | something that you can do. And there's also a default location for new attachments. So you can           |
| 31:44      | say, Hey, I would like to just put everything, all the attachments should be in a vault folder,          |
| 31:50      | or everything should be in a particular folder just called attachments, or everything should go          |
| 31:55      | into the same file as the note that it's going in, or it should go into a sub folder under the           |
| 32:00      | current folder. And those options are all worth having a think about and deciding what works for         |
| 32:05      | you. If you're somebody that tends to restructure things a lot, just because that's, you know,           |
| 32:11      | you haven't yet figured out your system and so on, then one of those may suit you better than            |
| 32:14      | another. Or if you're somebody that has a lot of attachments, maybe you don't want everything in         |
| 32:18      | in, you know, the same folder, because that'll make it difficult to find, you know, one image            |
| 32:24      | that, you know, you're looking for or something that you should be able to find it, hopefully            |
| 32:27      | through a note. So yeah, there's, there's all those things. And of course, there's also an               |
| 32:32      | option to make sure that all of the files in your vault gets synced as well, because by default,         |
| 32:37      | it will sync images, audio videos and PDFs, but it wouldn't sync anything else. So if like me,           |
| 32:42      | you throw the odd code file into [[Obsidian]], because you want to reference, you know, a piece of code      |
| 32:48      | that you wrote again and again, then you will need to make sure that that is on. And so yeah,            |
| 32:54      | that can be quite handy. [[Shortcuts]], it's a mixed bag. It is not a thing where you can just write         |
| 33:01      | a text file to your drive and it's going to show up. But they have good automation support. So           |
| 33:07      | via [[Shortcuts]]. So I'm sorry, I misspoke. Did I say [[Shortcuts]]? That you did, but that's okay,             |
| 33:13      | because [[Shortcuts]] support. Yeah, [[Apple Notes]]. [[Apple Notes]] does have great shortcut support,              |
| 33:19      | which is great. It is possibly one of the best actions on iOS for shortcut support as far as,            |
| 33:24      | you know, Apple's native applications go, which, you know, is very impressive. There are so many         |
| 33:30      | actions there, you know, for finding things, for creating things, for adding to existing                 |
| 33:35      | notes as well, appending to an existing note, that's all stuff that can be done via [[Shortcuts]].           |
| 33:41      | And that's a very impressive place. And, you know, I'm honestly, I'm really pleased with that.           |
| 33:48      | And I wish [[Apple Notes]] worked a little better with my brain. I prefer just to write [[Markdown]]             |
| 33:54      | and not necessarily have the rich text and so on. And also, I embed a lot of code into my notes.         |
| 34:00      | It's just a hazard of my day job and everything else that I do that code is such a big part of           |
| 34:05      | my life, but I need something with code [[Syntax Highlighting\|syntax highlighting]] support. So unfortunately,  |
| 34:10      | [[Apple Notes]] doesn't quite work for me, but the shortcut support is genuinely brilliant. So that should         |
| 34:14      | not be considered a blocker for anybody that's looking at using [[Apple Notes]].                             |
| 34:19      | Although I will say it's not as good in some ways, because although it's rich text, it doesn't really    |
| 34:26      | let you generate rich text via the shortcut automation, because you create a text field.                 |
| 34:32      | But if you want there to be checkboxes and headings and things like that, they just don't show up.       |
| 34:37      | I mean, you know, I've tried so many ways around this to write rich text, and there's just not a         |
| 34:44      | good way to do it. Like try to convert [[Markdown]] to rich text and then import it, and it doesn't work.    |
| 34:49      | I feel like there's a missing element there with [[Apple Notes]] and [[Shortcuts]].                              |
| 34:55      | Yeah. Yeah. I think that, I mean, the problem is very fundamentally that [[Shortcuts]], you know,            |
| 34:59      | text support is for plain text. It's not for [[Markdown]]. And I'm pretty certain that what happens          |
| 35:06      | with [[Apple Notes\|Notes]] is if you have like an add to note or append to note action, it takes, you know,              |
| 35:12      | it takes either like text or something akin to that. So yeah, I've just double checked the append        |
| 35:19      | to note action adds text to the end of the note. So I'm pretty certain that what happens is when         |
| 35:24      | it receives the text, it's just stripping out any formatting because it may not even receive             |
| 35:29      | the rich text. It probably just receives plain text because fun fact for anybody who doesn't             |
| 35:33      | know if you've got rich text, it's got like bold and colours and things like that. There's also           |
| 35:38      | like a plain text version of that almost always. And so what [[Shortcuts]] almost certainly be doing         |
| 35:43      | is going, okay, well, you're trying to give it the fancy text version, but it doesn't take fancy         |
| 35:47      | text. So I'm going to give it the plain text version, which, you know, at least it doesn't               |
| 35:52      | just drop it on the floor and be like, I did nothing. Bye. But it would be nice if it actually           |
| 35:58      | could take the rich text. But unfortunately, and I don't know if this is a limit of [[Shortcuts]],           |
| 36:01      | or if this is a limit of [[Apple Notes\|Notes]]. But yeah, I'm pretty certain that that is                                |
| 36:08      | just something that can't be done by shortcuts at the moment, which is a shame.                          |
| 36:11      | Yeah. Another limitation you pointed out is append and prepend. You can put text at the beginning        |
| 36:17      | or text at the end, but you cannot put it in the middle. Whereas with [[Obsidian]], [[NotePlan]],                |
| 36:21      | most of these more powerful tools, there's a way to address, to say, add this text under a specific      |
| 36:27      | heading. Yeah. And that is more useful for automators. And so I pay a price for putting                  |
| 36:33      | the veterinary and some of that stuff in [[Apple Notes]]. But I kind of want to use them.                    |
| 36:39      | My reasoning is a few things. First of all, [[Apple Notes]] does continue to get better,                     |
| 36:43      | and I want to use them so I can talk about them. But also, there is a convenience to them,               |
| 36:48      | because they're very good at media, you know, rich media, like if I take a picture of the                |
| 36:53      | [[DIP Switch\|DIP switches]] that's going to show up there, I know reliably. And there are advantages to it,             |
| 36:59      | but the automation is limited because of text formatting and then the inability to put text              |
| 37:05      | exactly in the document where you want the automation, which is kind of what brings me back              |
| 37:10      | to [[Drafts]]. You know, [[Drafts]] is always my cheat code. And I can put it in [[Drafts]] and then I can           |
| 37:16      | move it into [[Apple Notes]]. It's a manual process, but it's fine. And I don't do so much of this,          |
| 37:23      | that I like sit around all day doing this stuff. But the occasional, you know, I got back from           |
| 37:27      | the doctor appointment, I moved the text where it belonged in the right Apple Note and, you know,        |
| 37:32      | just took a minute. So it's fine. But that's something you have to deal with as you make these           |
| 37:37      | decisions. Yeah. And I think that that is, you know, it's always something to, you know, remember        |
| 37:45      | or at least be aware of, you know, you don't have to start with any perfect system and you can always    |
| 37:51      | modify your system, you know, whenever you want, you know, and change things up and so on and so         |
| 37:58      | forth. But, you know, there is no perfect system. And I think that is whenever you're setting up         |
| 38:03      | any kind of system, be it an automation system, [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system, whatever           |
| 38:07      | it is, perfect systems are, you know, they're a goal. They are not something that is necessarily         |
| 38:14      | achievable. And so, yeah, there will always be a trade off for these things, right? But at least,        |
| 38:23      | for example, you can put stuff into notes. And you can put stuff into whatever system it is you          |
| 38:30      | like. And, you know, putting things in [[Obsidian]], again, not perfect, because obsidian itself             |
| 38:34      | doesn't have shortcut sections. It's got [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]. So, you know, that's a little tricky.               |
| 38:40      | And they've got documentation on it and it works. And there's [[Drafts]] actions and so on as well. But      |
| 38:45      | for me, you know, I've ended up finding there's a lovely app called [[Actions For Obsidian]], which          |
| 38:52      | exists basically to put [[Shortcuts]] actions for [[Obsidian]] into your, into [[Shortcuts]]. And it's               |
| 39:00      | got a free 14 day trial and then a one time payment. But it creates actions for [[Obsidian]].                |
| 39:06      | And there's 50 of them. And that's really nice, because you can do things like getting                   |
| 39:11      | periodic notes, like a note for a particular day or just listing files and all that stuff.            |
| 39:15      | But again, that's not something that you can just do natively with [[Obsidian]], you have to add             |
| 39:22      | something on. And yeah, there is no perfect system. Yeah. Although [[Obsidian]] also has plugins built       |
| 39:30      | around making that process easier too. So there's a whole lot to it. And, and like, and I don't          |
| 39:37      | really want to get this into a comparison or anything, but, but like [[Apple Notes]] is better               |
| 39:42      | on iPhone than [[Obsidian]] is. But [[Obsidian]] is easier to automate into like you were saying,                |
| 39:47      | there's just trade offs. So kind of choose your poison and think about what you're using it for.         |
| 39:53      | Like one of my thoughts was, if I'm at the doctor or the veterinarian or whatever,                       |
| 39:58      | what's the easiest way to get access to this data if I'm asked for it? And having an [[Apple Notes]] to      |
| 40:03      | me is a big benefit for that, you know, whereas like, I'm not going to tell the doctor, hold on          |
| 40:08      | a second, my [[Obsidian]] database hasn't synced in a month. And I need, you know, you just don't want       |
| 40:13      | to deal with that. And so, so y'all, you know, you just pick where you want. But, but then use           |
| 40:19      | the automation tools available to you in the tools you have. And the good news is all of these tools     |
| 40:24      | have some degree of automation involved. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Like [[DEVONthink]], you know, it's,              |
| 40:30      | it's a bigger application. It's kind of the way I think of it, you know, you've got little               |
| 40:35      | applications like [[Drafts]]. And I say that [[Drafts]], [[Drafts]] is a sneaky one because it looks little          |
| 40:40      | and really simple. But actually, if you like, it's, if you go around the corner, you're like,            |
| 40:44      | Oh, wow, there's so much here. So it's not just little and simple. And then [[Obsidian]] is kind of          |
| 40:49      | a medium one of it can do a whole chunk. And then you've got all the plugins and the add-ons and         |
| 40:53      | so on to make it even cooler. And then [[DEVONthink]] for me is like, it's, it's, it's there. And it's,     |
| 40:58      | it's got the muscles, got the heftiness there, like, I'm here, what do you need me for? And it's         |
| 41:02      | got all the power and so on. And it's got great shortcut support. I have to say, you know, you           |
| 41:06      | can create [[Markdown]] items specifically in it, you can create text items, images, PDFs, and all of        |
| 41:10      | that straight from [[Shortcuts]]. And that is, you know, something that's really awesome. But at the         |
| 41:15      | same time, it's got this whole big database to it. It's not just text files in, you know, on your        |
| 41:22      | operating system, like it is just text files on your operating system. But please, if you're             |
| 41:26      | actually putting the files in [[DEVONthink]], and you're not indexing a folder, don't mess with             |
| 41:30      | those. That's when things start going wrong. That's bad. So yeah. But you know, there's,                 |
| 41:36      | there's trade-offs and wins and everything for all of these things. And I do love that in [[Obsidian]],      |
| 41:41      | I can say like, hey, like, I want to keep this group available offline. But still, if I've not           |
| 41:46      | opened [[Obsidian]] in a month, because I didn't think about it. And then I'm sitting, well, in your case,   |
| 41:50      | you're sitting at the vet's office, and you're there like, okay, now I need, oh, shoot, I haven't,       |
| 41:54      | I haven't synced this in a month. I'll open it now. Oh, great. There's, there's, you know,               |
| 41:58      | I've got like one spot of 3G. And it's not downloading because I added, you know, a whole                |
| 42:04      | bunch of scans of recent doc medical records into this. And so it's trying to download all those         |
| 42:09      | and so on. That can be a little bit annoying or frustrating when that happens. And that's not            |
| 42:13      | [[DEVONthink\|DEVONthink's]] fault, you know, that's, that's just how things work. If you're trying to download       |
| 42:18      | a whole bunch of files on slow internet connection, it's tricky. But if you've just got, you know,       |
| 42:22      | that one thing that you need to be able to access regularly for your doc, that goes in [[Apple Notes]]       |
| 42:28      | and maybe the scans of, you know, previous things that could still live in [[DEVONthink]],                  |
| 42:31      | because that's a better place for it. But you just have to find a system that works for you.             |
| 42:35      | All right. Well, you've moved us into an interesting topic of retrieving                                 |
| 42:40      | and linking the information because we do use automation to populate these things.                       |
| 42:45      | But is automation an option for getting access to the, to the data?                                      |
| 42:49      | Yeah. And that, that is the thing, right? How, how do you find something when you need it later?         |
| 42:54      | And part of this is, you know, making sure things have good titles that could either be                  |
| 42:59      | file names or just a title at the top of the document and so on. And tags can be useful here             |
| 43:05      | as well so that you can find things, basically put keywords on things so that when you look for          |
| 43:10      | those later or you look for different keywords, you find them. And that to me is like the first          |
| 43:16      | starting point because I have to think, you know, current me thinks this is the information that I       |
| 43:22      | need to retrieve this. Okay. Now go away, grab a glass of water, take out the recycling or something,    |
| 43:28      | come back. Okay. Now, five minutes later, me, what other words are useful for this so that I can         |
| 43:33      | remember this? And what other information do I need to link to this? Because that is the other           |
| 43:38      | thing, you know, what, what information belongs together, putting like information in a similar          |
| 43:42      | place or cross linking things and so on. That's all quite important. You know, if you want to            |
| 43:48      | be able to go from here to here and back again, then, you know, linking things together is very,         |
| 43:54      | very important. Yeah. And it really is a payoff in a lot of ways because these tools are excellent       |
| 44:01      | at linking. A lot of them allow you to create internal links inside their database that lets             |
| 44:07      | you jump between notes, which is to tap the, you know, the double bracket is generally the               |
| 44:14      | syntax for that [[Obsidian]] uses it [[Roam Research\|Roam]] uses it note plan. So you can jump around within the               |
| 44:19      | document, but also these tools are excellent at creating your links into the specific document           |
| 44:25      | from outside the application. So then you can drop that link into [[DEVONthink]] or [[OmniFocus]] or          |
| 44:32      | whatever, and then link straight into that data. And again, that gets you there so quickly,              |
| 44:39      | which is what we're looking for. Yes. And I think that is, you know, that is the thing you want          |
| 44:45      | it to be fast. Okay. If you're looking for information, it shouldn't be faster to go,                    |
| 44:50      | [DuckDuckGo search](https://duckduckgo.com) or [Google search](https://google.com) or whatever it is to find that information that it is to             |
| 44:56      | look it up in your [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system. Because if it's taking you longer to            |
| 45:02      | find it, you know, the same way that you had to go through to find the information originally,           |
| 45:06      | have you gained anything? Possibly not. Maybe you have, because you've added your own notes              |
| 45:11      | and so on to it. But ideally, it should be really fast to look up and find and that that for me is,      |
| 45:16      | you know, the thing that I always try to remember. So I tend to have just an area at the bottom of       |
| 45:21      | my notes, David, and this might sound really crazy, but this is just like search term dump. And          |
| 45:26      | like sometimes I will know that, hey, this particular thing here, like I'll find it because              |
| 45:33      | the problem that I'm searching for is called this or something. And I'll just have like a little         |
| 45:38      | section at the bottom where I note down like things that might cause me to look for this,                |
| 45:42      | which then in turn, it means that if I search for a particular error that I know I've encountered        |
| 45:46      | before and I have a good way of fixing it in my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system,                    |
| 45:50      | I will find it and ta-da, done. Yeah. Yeah. And these power tools that we're talking about               |
| 45:58      | just have so many things to do. There's like so many plugins for [[Obsidian]] that make it easier            |
| 46:03      | to search and find data and to a lesser extent, no plan for even [[Apple Notes]]. Like there's ways          |
| 46:10      | to search it faster. I use an [[Alfred]] plugin where I just trigger [[Alfred]] and type in space                |
| 46:17      | and then just searches the [[Apple Notes]] titles so I can get to what I need very quickly.                  |
| 46:23      | But yeah, bring automation to bear in finding the data as well as creating it.                           |
| 46:29      | Yes. And I think that is something that is worth remembering. [[Hook\|Hookmark]] is great for creating notes       |
| 46:37      | or for creating links for things and so on as well so that you can cross link things. But I do           |
| 46:42      | you, I do try to mostly think about, okay, well, I'm using [[Obsidian]], I'm using D[[DEVONthink]]. Both         |
| 46:47      | of those have notes, URLs for all of the things that are in them so I can just link that somewhere       |
| 46:53      | else. So if I have a particular setup, for example, for running the cleaning cycle on my                 |
| 46:58      | washing machine, then I can actually put that in [[Obsidian]] because that's a living breathing              |
| 47:06      | document and I can link to the PDF of my washing machine manual in [[DEVONthink]]and from                  |
| 47:11      | one to the other, I just tap and ta-da, that's it. Yeah. No, I mean, it's all about the linking.         |
| 47:18      | Absolutely. Any other stuff you're doing? You had a note in here about [[Obsidian\|Obsidian's]] [[Dataview]]              |
| 47:24      | and data review. How are you using those two together? Yeah, so [[Dataview]] is just really nice            |
| 47:30      | for creating a visual representation of or like pulling information out of things. So say, for           |
| 47:38      | example, you decide that you want to store project templates or project information and big tasks        |
| 47:47      | and so on in [[Obsidian]], then [[Dataview]] can grab tasks out of things or it can make a pretty list          |
| 47:54      | of notes organised by data that you've put in it or it can create a visual version of those things       |
| 48:05      | as well, like pulling that information out and it's very nice for that sort of thing. It's               |
| 48:11      | definitely a more advanced way of handling your data in [[Obsidian]], but for me, that can be really         |
| 48:19      | nice and I've used this, for example, for example, so my network stuff, I started with the note for      |
| 48:26      | my router and I realised that or for the ISP router and I realised that the other router, I've also      |
| 48:31      | done some things on, so I created a note for that and so router one connects to router two               |
| 48:36      | and then router two, well, it connects to a whole bunch of other things, but sometimes it's useful       |
| 48:41      | to know like the MAC address of the devices, which IP address I have assigned to it and so on and so     |
| 48:46      | forth and so I started creating notes for these other ones and then I used data view to link it          |
| 48:51      | all together because it was possible to do that and yeah, it's just quite nice to have that as           |
| 48:58      | a possibility with [[Obsidian]] and it's not necessarily something you need. If you want just diagrams in    |
| 49:03      | [[Obsidian]], then it does have support for [[Mermaid]] diagrams, which are very pretty and text based           |
| 49:10      | and quite simple to create, but it's just, yeah, the [[Dataview]] is very, very nice to have as an          |
| 49:19      | enhancement if you're looking for it, but you don't have to go all that nerdy with these things.         |
| 49:26      | It's a possibility, but it's not a requirement and I would say with all of these things, wait until      |
| 49:32      | you have a need for the thing before you find a way to solve that problem in whatever system you're      |
| 49:37      | using because otherwise if you start with, well, I need diagrams and I need to be able to pull out       |
| 49:42      | a list of tasks and so on, but you never put tasks in there, then you don't need a way to pull           |
| 49:47      | a list of tasks until you have a list of tasks you need to pull out and you can't easily just            |
| 49:52      | find it quickly with a search. And I think people can get intimidated with a tool like [[Obsidian]]          |
| 49:56      | to say, well, I've got all these files in here. How do I service what I want? And [[Dataview]] is           |
| 50:02      | the answer to that. You can create, in essence, smart files and smart folders or smart groupings         |
| 50:07      | and tag based tables of outstanding projects or whatever it is you want to do, it really is              |
| 50:15      | very flexible. But finding your way to your [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] data via automation is very useful. I keep               |
| 50:24      | coming back to [[Apple Notes]] because I've got it also running and it is a challenge because                |
| 50:31      | getting to things aren't as easy. You can get a URL link to an Apple note out, but again,                |
| 50:37      | I'm using that [[Alfred]] plugin to pull that off and it's not easy. Whereas these other apps make           |
| 50:43      | it so easy. I was thinking, wouldn't it be nice for the hypothetical vet appointment if I had a link     |
| 50:51      | to the appropriate note in the calendar event, right? So I could just pull it up while sitting           |
| 50:56      | there. Well, I could do that very fast in [[Obsidian]] slash [[Roam Research\|Roam]] slash [[NotePlan]] slash most                  |
| 51:03      | of the things we're talking about here, but it takes a little extra work on [[Apple Notes]]. And             |
| 51:07      | frankly, to do it on the iPhone, it's even more work because I don't have an [[Alfred]] plugin. I've         |
| 51:12      | got to kind of go through and go through the mechanics of sharing the note, but then not share           |
| 51:16      | it, but then that generates the URL. I mean, [[Apple]] doesn't make it as easy as some of these other        |
| 51:22      | tools. Yeah. And I think that is one of the things like, again, you could do it via [[Shortcuts]] where      |
| 51:27      | you, you know, you grab the note and then you use the get link to, which works for [[Shortcuts]]. I'm        |
| 51:33      | pretty certain it works for [[Apple Notes\|Notes]] as well, which like it generates the sharing link and then, you        |
| 51:37      | know, gives it to you so you can copy it. But still, that's a whole bunch of extra steps. And, you       |
| 51:42      | know, that's not necessarily worth it. But for something like the vet note for your dog, that            |
| 51:47      | note can now also be shared with your wife because it's in [[Apple Notes\|Notes]]. And that's something that your         |
| 51:52      | wife will immediately get. She'll understand it. There doesn't need to be an explanation of what         |
| 51:58      | this is and why it's important and how it works and so on and so forth. It's just here's a note          |
| 52:02      | about the dog and all the previous vet visits because I, you know, I have to go do a thing and           |
| 52:06      | you're taking the dog to the vet today and that's it. That happened to me. I was out of town on          |
| 52:12      | business and the dog got sick. And so the kids were going to take the dog to the vet and I               |
| 52:17      | shared that Apple note and they had everything I did, you know, with it very easy, you know.             |
| 52:22      | So yeah, it is an interesting time with [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]]. There's lots of ways to create the data to                  |
| 52:28      | share the data. I think the platform you're pick is going to definitely impact what kind of automation   |
| 52:33      | you do. But if you bring some, an open mind to it, I think all of the tools we've talked about           |
| 52:39      | have automation options. And if you're intimidated by the idea of [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], you know, put some automation     |
| 52:45      | behind it and it gets a lot easier. Yes, absolutely. And, you know, automation is a really great tool    |
| 52:52      | for [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] because it can allow you to quickly grab things and so on as well. One little thing I            |
| 52:58      | will actually mention, David, because this is something I use all the time and I forgot about            |
| 53:04      | it until literally just now is a URL linker on the [[App Store\|Mac App Store]]. It allows me to like right             |
| 53:11      | click on a page and copy a [[Markdown]] link to that page from [[Safari]] or I can select text and I can,        |
| 53:22      | you know, I can link that and it will copy that as well. And that is just a really nice                  |
| 53:27      | useful, it's a free little tool. And that is the sort of automation that is really nice and easy         |
| 53:33      | to start with. [[URL Linker for Safari]] specifically supports adding like a whole bunch of different        |
| 53:38      | formats to your right click menu. So, you know, if you have a company Wiki that has like a particular    |
| 53:43      | syntax for links, then you could have that in [[Safari]] as well. So you can right click and copy            |
| 53:50      | for Wiki, copy for [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], whatever it is you want, copy as [[Markdown]] link, you know, whatever you           |
| 53:57      | like. But that is, you know, that's the sort of place where it's really easy to get started with         |
| 54:00      | a foothold of these things. And then later you can go on to figuring out like an automatic way to        |
| 54:05      | add tags to certain kinds of notes or to funnel these notes over here into your work [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] versus          |
| 54:10      | your personal [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] and so on. But starting, start simple and then grow from there is definitely           |
| 54:15      | what I'd say for this because a [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] is only as good as the data inside of it. And if you're just         |
| 54:20      | junk it up with a lot of useless data that you never want to come back to and you never want to          |
| 54:24      | organise, then it's not going to be an amazing system for you. So yeah, start small and work             |
| 54:29      | your way up. And that kind of explains our own evolutions because my original [[Obsidian]]                   |
| 54:36      | hold everything was great until it wasn't because I don't want the veterinary stuff showing up in        |
| 54:42      | a search for the other stuff I do in that database. And like you just kind of know when it's time to     |
| 54:49      | split these things out. Yeah. Okay. Well, we are the Automators podcast. You can find this               |
| 54:57      | at relay.fm/automators. We are going to have an Automators Max episode today for the folks         |
| 55:04      | that are our subscribers. Automators Max subscribers get the ad for extended version of                  |
| 55:09      | the show. We're going to be talking about [[Artificial Intelligence]] and automation of voice                |
| 55:14      | to text in that today. As we mentioned, we only have one episode left of the Automators. We're           |
| 55:20      | ending our run sadly, but with what we feel like a good body of episodes in the archive here.            |
| 55:27      | If you're an Automators Max subscriber and you have questions about it, you can transfer that            |
| 55:31      | subscription to another show or I think they even have a refund system. Let Relay know you should        |
| 55:37      | have got an email. So that should be handled. But if you have any problems, let us know as well.         |
| 55:42      | We'll make sure you get handled. And otherwise, we will see you next time. Goodbye, folks.               |

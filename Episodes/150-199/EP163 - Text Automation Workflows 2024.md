| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators.                                        |
| 00:03      | I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.      |
| 00:06      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                  |
| 00:06      | How are you?                                                      |
| 00:08      | I'm doing better than it sounds like you're doing, David.         |
| 00:10      | It sounds like you've still got a bit of a cold                   |
| 00:12      | floating around there.                                            |
| 00:13      | And hopefully, you'll make it through today's episode.            |
| 00:16      | Yeah, well, I'll be fine.                                         |
| 00:18      | But it's a little bit of a bummer, but I'll live.                 |
| 00:20      | This is The Automators, where we talk about how                   |
| 00:22      | to automate your technology to do your work for you.              |
| 00:26      | We have a fun show planned today about text capture               |
| 00:29      | and working with text.                                            |
| 00:30      | There's a lot of automation options there,                        |
| 00:31      | so I'm looking forward to this one.                               |
| 00:33      | But before we do, we have a few preliminary things.               |
| 00:37      | It is officially September as this show goes out,                 |
| 00:40      | and that means it's time to talk about Relay for St. Jude.        |
| 00:45      | Every year, we do a fundraiser at Relay FM for St. Jude,          |
| 00:51      | which is an institution devoted to giving children                |
| 00:54      | free care for cancer.                                             |
| 00:56      | And if you have a child and they are dealing with                 |
| 01:00      | childhood cancer, Relay not only takes care of them,              |
| 01:03      | they fly you out there, they put you up in a hotel.               |
| 01:06      | It's just a wonderful institution.                                |
| 01:08      | Sometimes you give money to a group and you're like,              |
| 01:11      | huh, do I really want to give money to them?                      |
| 01:13      | It's very easy with Relay and St. Jude,                           |
| 01:16      | because St. Jude takes care of sick children,                     |
| 01:20      | and the network has a personal relationship with St. Jude.        |
| 01:23      | We've been working with them for years.                           |
| 01:25      | [[Stephen Hackett]], one of the co-founders of Relay,                 |
| 01:28      | has personal experience with it with one of his children.         |
| 01:31      | And, man, it's time to pony up, everybody.                        |
| 01:35      | Yes, yeah.                                                        |
| 01:36      | It is a fabulous organisation to donate to,                       |
| 01:39      | and for those outside of the US going,                            |
| 01:42      | well, you know, we have healthcare in this country.               |
| 01:45      | St. Jude shares their research around the world,                  |
| 01:47      | which means that everybody, not just children,                    |
| 01:50      | get to benefit from the work done at St. Jude,                    |
| 01:52      | which is just fabulous.                                           |
| 01:54      | And there's all sorts of fundraisers going on                     |
| 01:56      | in the Relay community,                                           |
| 01:58      | where people are doing fun and crazy things,                      |
| 02:01      | like snarky reviews of your tech setups and so on,                |
| 02:05      | and there's all sorts of great things that you can find           |
| 02:09      | over at stjude.org/relay,                                   |
| 02:12      | where you could also even create your own mini campaign           |
| 02:14      | if you want to raise money in a way that suits you.               |
| 02:18      | Yeah, and we really do try to make it fun.                        |
| 02:21      | There's all sorts of incentives                                   |
| 02:23      | if you give certain amounts of money.                             |
| 02:25      | One of the things I really like about it,                         |
| 02:27      | and this is a new benefit for me, Rose,                           |
| 02:29      | is my wife got a full-time job for a big fancy corporation,       |
| 02:34      | and they do matching.                                             |
| 02:35      | So now when we do our annual St. Jude contribution,               |
| 02:40      | we double our money.                                              |
| 02:41      | So if you've got an employer who matches, think about that.       |
| 02:45      | They've got a whole explanation about that                        |
| 02:47      | on the website as well,                                           |
| 02:48      | and St. Jude makes it really easy.                                |
| 02:50      | So gang, go check it out.                                         |
| 02:53      | We've got a link in the show notes,                               |
| 02:56      | but it is time every year,                                        |
| 03:00      | the Relay network and its listeners just steps it up.             |
| 03:03      | And I love that because you hear so often,                        |
| 03:06      | like nerd culture is not friendly,                                |
| 03:09      | and nerd culture is not helping people.                           |
| 03:13      | But this is a group of people,                                    |
| 03:15      | and that is you, the listeners, and us, the hosts,                |
| 03:18      | that are just the opposite of that.                               |
| 03:19      | We do try to help, and this is a great way to do it.              |
| 03:22      | So once again, they've raised over 2.9 million                    |
| 03:25      | over the past several years.                                      |
| 03:28      | The people at St. Jude are still scratching their head.           |
| 03:30      | They don't understand how these nerd podcasters                   |
| 03:33      | are able to raise so much money.                                  |
| 03:35      | Well, it's because you, the listeners, are so generous.           |
| 03:37      | So go check it out.                                               |
| 03:39      | And like I said, we got a link in the show notes,                 |
| 03:41      | and it's time to step up                                          |
| 03:43      | and help out the folks over at St. Jude.                          |
| 03:46      | Yes, as we're recording this episode,                             |
| 03:48      | I believe, David, actually, they've just hit                      |
| 03:49      | the 3 million mark, which is insane.                              |
| 03:52      | So I'm really pleased and excited about that.                     |
| 03:55      | And that just shows how wonderful the community is,               |
| 03:57      | which includes all of our fabulous Automators, listeners.         |
| 04:00      | Today in the bonus section for members,                           |

| 04:09      | It gets you an ad-free extended version of the show.              |
| 04:12      | We're gonna be doing what we call *Apple Event Wishcasting*.        |
| 04:14      | You know, [[Apple\|Apple's]] got an event coming up on the 9th of September. |
| 04:18      | We have ideas, we have wishes.                                    |
| 04:21      | We're gonna talk about all that in the bonus section.             |
| 04:24      | But today's subject is text capture.                              |
| 04:27      | And we've danced around this in prior episodes,                   |
| 04:30      | but, you know, it's a new year,                                   |
| 04:31      | and it's time to kind of go back to this topic.                   |
| 04:34      | There's a lot of new tools available,                             |
| 04:36      | and Rose and I have been evolving our workflows.                  |
| 04:39      | So we thought this would be a fun one.                            |
| 04:41      | Yeah, definitely.                                                 |
| 04:42      | And honestly, you know, you said, David,                          |
| 04:45      | it's time to, you know, look at what's changed and so on.         |
| 04:47      | But text capture, for me, there's basically two constants.        |
| 04:52      | And I do experiment with other things, folks.                     |
| 04:53      | I promise you, I go out and I try all the things.                 |
| 04:57      | But in the end, I come back to my tried and trusted duo,          |
| 05:02      | [[Drafts]] and [[Just Press Record]].                                     |
| 05:05      | Because for me, between the two of them,                          |
| 05:08      | [[Drafts]], I can either dictate into it,                             |
| 05:10      | or I can just write into it,                                      |
| 05:11      | and it works really well.                                         |
| 05:13      | Or if I know I'm going to be doing something                      |
| 05:15      | and I need to dictate it,                                         |
| 05:16      | but there's some funny words in there,                            |
| 05:18      | which, you know, it could be homonyms or whatever it is,          |
| 05:22      | things that have got strange names at work.                       |
| 05:24      | I use [[Just Press Record]],                                          |
| 05:25      | because then I get the audio                                      |
| 05:27      | plus the automated transcription.                                 |
| 05:28      | So I can go through and listen back to what I said                |
| 05:31      | and make sure that I get it right.                                |
| 05:33      | And for me, text capture pretty much always                       |
| 05:37      | just starts with those two.                                       |
| 05:39      | But I know, David, you've been doing a lot more                   |
| 05:41      | experimenting with that recently.                                 |
| 05:43      | I feel like we're at an interesting crossroad                     |
| 05:47      | with [[artificial intelligence]].                                     |
| 05:48      | And there's a lot, you know,                                      |
| 05:50      | the [[artificial intelligence]] conversation,                         |
| 05:52      | there's a lot to it,                                              |
| 05:53      | and we can go down all sorts of rabbit holes                      |
| 05:55      | and get wound up about it.                                        |
| 05:56      | But one of the benefits of [[artificial intelligence]],               |
| 06:00      | in my mind, is whisper transcription,                             |
| 06:03      | which is a much improved [[Artificial Intelligence\|artificial intelligence-based]]            |
| 06:06      | transcription engine.                                             |
| 06:08      | And there's a bunch of app developers                             |
| 06:10      | that have got on board with this.                                 |
| 06:12      | And the one that has landed for me,                               |
| 06:15      | just because it seems to be under active development,             |
| 06:18      | and, you know, he adds a bunch of great features                  |
| 06:21      | that kind of work for the stuff I do is [[Whisper Memos]].            |
| 06:23      | And it's just an application on your phone.                       |
| 06:27      | You push a button and you talk.                                   |
| 06:29      | It records your voice                                             |
| 06:30      | and then runs it through the [[Whisper Memos]],                       |
| 06:34      | [[Whisper]] transcription engine                                      |
| 06:36      | and spits out of a very good transcript.                          |
| 06:39      | It's not perfect, but it's very good.                             |
| 06:42      | What makes [[Whisper Memos]] in particular useful to me               |
| 06:45      | is a couple of features.                                          |
| 06:47      | One is he's added the ability to add custom vocabulary            |
| 06:51      | because a lot of times [[Whisper]],                                   |
| 06:53      | if you have any sort of proper noun                               |
| 06:55      | and "MacSparky" is one that [[Whisper]] always stumbles on,        |
| 06:59      | you can tell, hey, this is a special word that I have.            |
| 07:02      | You know, if you have something that sounds like "Max Barky",      |
| 07:06      | it's actually "MacSparky".                                         |
| 07:08      | And it'll fix that for me.                                        |
| 07:10      | So that's the first thing he did.                                 |
| 07:11      | The second thing is he added a direct email.                      |
| 07:15      | So when it finishes the transcript,                               |
| 07:17      | it'll send the email out to you.                                  |
| 07:19      | And the email I use is the [[Drafts]] custom email.                   |
| 07:23      | You know, if you use [[Drafts]],                                      |
| 07:24      | I think you need to be paid on it.                                |
| 07:26      | I'm not sure if this is a feature available                       |
| 07:28      | to the free version,                                              |
| 07:29      | but you have a mail to [[Drafts]] email address.                      |
| 07:33      | It's like a secret email.                                         |
| 07:35      | You send anything to that via email.                              |
| 07:37      | It shows up in your [[Drafts]] inbox.                                 |
| 07:39      | So [[Whisper Memos\|Whisper]][^1] sends it to [[Drafts]] for me with zero work.              |
| 07:43      | You know, talk about automation, right?                           |
| 07:45      | And then they did a really good job                               |
| 07:48      | with [[Whisper Memos]] on the [[Apple Watch]].                            |
| 07:50      | And particularly, you know,                                       |
| 07:52      | you can trigger a whisper memo session off a complication.        |
| 07:56      | Or in my case, I made a shortcut                                  |
| 07:59      | to trigger a [[Whisper Memos]] session                                 |
| 08:01      | and attached it to the big orange action button                   |
| 08:04      | on my [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Apple Watch Ultra]].       |
| 08:06      | So, you know, some people use that action button                  |
| 08:09      | to, you know, run a relay race                                    |
| 08:13      | or, you know, do a marathon.                                      |
| 08:15      | I use it to dictate.                                              |
| 08:17      | But I find myself pushing that orange button                      |
| 08:21      | many times a day.                                                 |
| 08:22      | And so what I've got is basically                                 |
| 08:24      | a transcription machine following me around.                      |
| 08:27      | And any time an idea occurs to me,                                |
| 08:30      | whether it's just rough text for a blog post                      |
| 08:32      | or just like I just heard something on a podcast                  |
| 08:36      | and I want to explore that idea further                           |
| 08:39      | or, you know, any idea that I occur,                              |
| 08:42      | this is really kind of replaced                                   |
| 08:44      | the old workflow I had with [[Drafts]]                                |
| 08:46      | where I would go into [[Drafts]] and dictate into [[Drafts]]              |
| 08:48      | because I find the [[Whisper Memos\|Whisper]][^1] workflow for me works better.          |
| 08:53      | You don't see the words as you dictate to [[Whisper Memos\|Whisper]][^1].                |
| 08:56      | All you're doing is talking.                                      |
| 08:59      | And so you don't get distracted                                   |
| 09:01      | about whether it got it right or not.                             |
| 09:03      | You just talk, you know, and when you're done,                    |
| 09:06      | it does the transcription                                         |
| 09:07      | and it usually does a pretty good job.                            |
| 09:08      | It does it good enough.                                           |
| 09:10      | It's not perfect, but it's always improving.                      |
| 09:12      | And this is a new workflow for me                                 |
| 09:16      | that I've been using maybe the last six months or so.             |
| 09:19      | And boy, has it stuck because the ability to,                     |
| 09:22      | like I said, push the orange button on your watch                 |
| 09:24      | and talk and have that appear in [[Drafts]].                          |
| 09:27      | That's pretty awesome.                                            |
| 09:28      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 09:29      | Which generation of the [[Apple Watch]] do you have, David?           |
| 09:32      | Because I found with the original [[Apple Watch]],                    |
| 09:34      | the action button was good, but it was slow.                      |
| 09:37      | So I press it and then you wait and wait and wait.                |
| 09:41      | And it wasn't like waiting forever,                               |
| 09:43      | but it felt quite slow                                            |
| 09:45      | when you were waiting for a thing to happen,                      |
| 09:47      | especially if you just want to quickly dictate something.         |
| 09:50      | To the point where I found it was actually faster                 |
| 09:52      | to have complications on my [[Apple Watch]] screen                    |
| 09:54      | that I could then tap,                                            |
| 09:56      | which is what I'm doing now.                                      |
| 09:57      | I'm on the [[Apple Watch]] Series 9.                                  |
| 09:59      | So I sort of alternate between my [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Apple Watch Ultra]] original      |
| 10:03      | and my Series 9 as I want,                                        |
| 10:05      | but I still find the action button on my [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Ultra]]                    |
| 10:08      | is a little slow.                                                 |
| 10:09      | Is that something you've experienced?                             |
| 10:11      | Yeah, I just looked,                                              |
| 10:12      | it's about a four second delay from the moment                    |
| 10:16      | I press the button to the time it is safely.                      |
| 10:18      | Like I always wait until the [[Whisper Memos]] engine,                 |
| 10:23      | the clock starts ticking.                                         |
| 10:25      | So you see it like one,                                           |
| 10:26      | you see it clocking and then it's like actually recording         |
| 10:29      | and everything's working.                                         |
| 10:31      | Occasionally it doesn't do that.                                  |
| 10:33      | Sometimes you run the shortcut                                    |
| 10:35      | and it doesn't start recording, which is not good.                |
| 10:38      | So I always check that before I start talking.                    |
| 10:41      | And so that's about a four second delay.                          |
| 10:43      | If that was faster, I would prefer that.                          |
| 10:45      | But to be honest,                                                 |
| 10:46      | it doesn't bother me that much that it's a four seconds.          |
| 10:49      | It usually takes me a few minutes to gather my thoughts           |
| 10:52      | before I start dictating anyway.                                  |
| 10:54      | So I don't think it's really bothering me that much,              |
| 10:57      | but if someday I get a new watch and that's faster,               |
| 11:00      | I would like that.                                                |
| 11:02      | Yeah, that makes sense.                                           |
| 11:03      | For me, I was finding that because I was using it                 |
| 11:05      | for things like,                                                  |
| 11:06      | hey, I want to like start this workout now.                       |
| 11:08      | And I'd hit it as the class was starting,                         |
| 11:11      | then as the teacher's going through marking                       |
| 11:13      | the first couple of positions for ballet                          |
| 11:14      | or telling us what we need to be doing                            |
| 11:16      | for the warmup or so,                                             |
| 11:17      | and then I felt that I kept glancing at my watch,                 |
| 11:19      | waiting to see, did it do it yet?                                 |
| 11:21      | Did it do it yet?                                                 |
| 11:21      | Did it do it yet?                                                 |
| 11:23      | And yeah, that just seemed problematic for me.                    |
| 11:25      | So I've gone with the good old fashioned approach                 |
| 11:28      | of [[Focus Mode\|focus modes]] and having my watch face change                    |
| 11:31      | per focus mode,                                                   |
| 11:32      | which means that I have the right action button,                  |
| 11:35      | which for driving in particular is the,                           |
| 11:39      | what is it?                                                       |
| 11:40      | The large text face with the [[Drafts]] complication.                |
| 11:42      | That's it.                                                        |
| 11:43      | That's all it's got on there.                                     |
| 11:44      | But that makes it much easier for me to quickly dictate.          |
| 11:47      | Yeah, I'll experiment with that a bit,                            |
| 11:49      | but I'll tell you just the physicality                            |
| 11:52      | of pressing the button is really nice,                            |
| 11:56      | even with a little delay.                                         |
| 11:57      | But I have the first generation [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Ultra Apple Watch]]                 |
| 12:00      | and I don't know if I'll get another one,                         |
| 12:04      | if I'll like update it this year or not.                          |
| 12:07      | I'm kind of inclined to wait another year,                        |
| 12:09      | but we'll talk about that, I guess,                               |
| 12:11      | and later in Automator's Max.                                     |
| 12:13      | But I do think it's a really nice way to capture text.            |
| 12:20      | Now I am a little biased towards dictation                        |
| 12:22      | because I was a lawyer and when you're a young lawyer,            |
| 12:25      | they really push it on you.                                       |
| 12:26      | So I'm very comfortable speaking into a thingamabob            |
| 12:32      | and having the words come out the other end.                      |
| 12:34      | And there's been all sorts of different versions                  |
| 12:36      | of the thing of a bob over my lifetime.                           |
| 12:38      | I mean, when it started,                                          |
| 12:39      | it was little cassette recorders                                  |
| 12:41      | and you'd hand it to someone who would type it for you.           |
| 12:43      | So just to show you how old I am,                                 |
| 12:46      | but this is nice.                                                 |
| 12:48      | And I think if you're interested in this type of work,            |
| 12:53      | I think removing the live typing while you speak                  |
| 12:57      | really does kind of free you up a little bit.                     |
| 12:59      | So give it a try.                                                 |
| 13:01      | You don't have to use [[Whisper Memos]],                              |
| 13:03      | there's a bunch of these apps that do stuff like this,            |
| 13:05      | but I found [[Whisper Memos]] pretty good.                            |
| 13:07      | I paid for a year for it                                          |
| 13:09      | and I feel like the developer has been trying                     |
| 13:12      | to keep my money, trying to earn it.                              |
| 13:14      | He's always doing updates.                                        |
| 13:15      | And they did at some point sponsor my blog.                       |
| 13:20      | So if you think I'm in the bag for them, that would be why.       |
| 13:23      | But I try to pick the best tools                                  |
| 13:26      | and I've been really helpful with it.                             |
| 13:28      | Yes, one thing I've been experimenting                            |
| 13:31      | with a little bit more though, David,                             |
| 13:32      | is Siri dictation in iOS 18.1,                                    |
| 13:37      | which is currently only available for beta testers                |
| 13:40      | with their regions set to the United States                       |
| 13:41      | and not beta testers from the European Union.                     |
| 13:45      | But [[Apple]] made a big thing at [[WWDC]]                                |
| 13:47      | about how [[Siri]] and [[Apple Intelligence]] is a lot smarter.           |
| 13:51      | So you can say, you know,                                         |
| 13:52      | hey [[Siri\|Apple lady]], add this to my calendar for Tuesday.              |
| 13:56      | No, wait, I mean Thursday and [[Siri]] will get it.                   |
| 13:59      | And I've been experimenting with that                             |
| 14:01      | in the dictation realm a little bit.                              |
| 14:03      | And I'm finding that it's working there as well.                  |
| 14:07      | And it's quite interesting                                        |
| 14:09      | because sometimes you might genuinely say                         |
| 14:12      | or want to dictate exactly what I said just now.                  |
| 14:15      | Tuesday, oh no wait, I mean Thursday,                             |
| 14:19      | because you're trying to put something in                         |
| 14:21      | as like a speech dictation or similar                             |
| 14:23      | where somebody is saying exactly that.                            |
| 14:26      | But I found it seems better, like quite a bit better.             |
| 14:31      | And because I've been using [[Drafts]] and [[Just Press Record]]          |
| 14:34      | which are using the native iOS transcription APIs,                |
| 14:38      | I've been finding that microtranscriptions                        |
| 14:40      | in those apps are better as well.                                 |
| 14:42      | How have you been finding it?                                     |
| 14:44      | Or are you not playing with iOS 18.1 just yet?                    |
| 14:47      | No, I have point one installed                                    |
| 14:49      | but it hadn't occurred to me to test that.                        |
| 14:51      | So I will play with it a bit.                                     |
| 14:54      | Like one question I have is the context of that.                  |
| 14:58      | Like is the way they implemented it                               |
| 15:01      | that Siri dictation just works better across the board            |
| 15:03      | or does it have to be like in a specific context?                 |
| 15:07      | Like there's an Apple Notes feature                               |
| 15:08      | where you can dictate and then it'll transcribe                   |
| 15:11      | for you kind of more along the lines                              |
| 15:13      | of what I was talking about with [[Whisper Memos]].                   |
| 15:15      | And I don't know, and [[Apple\|Apple's]] been a little kind of shy           |
| 15:19      | about explaining what they did with that.                         |
| 15:21      | So I'm not sure where the differences are.                        |
| 15:25      | My guess is this is all done on device though                     |
| 15:27      | which is a big advantage, right?                                  |
| 15:29      | Because you want that.                                            |
| 15:31      | Now I wrote the [[Whisper Memos]] guy                                 |
| 15:33      | and he wrote me back to say that they put the model               |
| 15:36      | on your device in the app.                                        |
| 15:38      | That it doesn't go to the website, but they do email it.          |
| 15:43      | So they are getting the text.                                     |
| 15:45      | So yeah, I do think that there's a lot of arguments               |
| 15:49      | to say that this should be handled by the platform vendor         |
| 15:52      | and it should be private.                                         |
| 15:53      | And I think that is something a lot of us are waiting to see.     |
| 15:57      | Because if it gets good enough, then good for you.                |
| 16:00      | I mean, the same thing kind of works with texts,                  |
| 16:03      | you know, grammar correction, I'm a little head,                  |
| 16:06      | but you know, if [[Apple]] can do it sufficiently                     |
| 16:10      | and we don't have to send it to somebody's server,                |
| 16:12      | that's good.                                                      |
| 16:14      | Yes, yeah.                                                        |
| 16:15      | So I think we are very much going to have to wait                 |
| 16:17      | and see on that because we're still, you know,                    |
| 16:19      | we're talking now, we're recording towards the end of August.     |
| 16:22      | This episode is releasing at the beginning of September           |
| 16:25      | and we're talking about iOS 18.1,                                 |
| 16:27      | which realistically is probably not going to be out               |
| 16:29      | until October, maybe even November.                               |
| 16:31      | So, you know, they've got us on the beta train early              |
| 16:35      | because they want feedback.                                       |
| 16:36      | And I've been finding, you know, honestly,                        |
| 16:38      | [[Siri]] and [[Apple Intelligence]] is learning really well               |
| 16:42      | from what I type and who I talk to                                |
| 16:46      | and how I talk to each person                                     |
| 16:48      | for doing things like generating texts and so on.                 |
| 16:51      | And I've been finding that that has been                          |
| 16:55      | sort of bleeding out into other areas                             |
| 16:57      | where when I'm dictating things, it'll realise, okay,             |
| 17:01      | well, this seems to be, you know, related to this stuff           |
| 17:03      | that you were, you know, typing earlier                           |
| 17:05      | and it pulls in that information                                  |
| 17:07      | and uses that for spelling and so on.                             |
| 17:09      | It's not perfect, but it does seem to be improving                |
| 17:12      | and getting there.                                                |
| 17:12      | So yeah, I guess we're going to have to wait                      |
| 17:15      | and see on that one.                                              |
| 17:16      | Yeah, I do feel like, and I don't want to go                      |
| 17:18      | many more down this rabbit hole,                                  |
| 17:20      | but I do feel like it's never been more important                 |
| 17:23      | for Apple to get this right,                                      |
| 17:25      | this type of work right than now.                                 |
| 17:27      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 17:27      | And I think they know that.                                       |
| 17:29      | So I do think they're going to put a lot of effort                |
| 17:31      | into this.                                                        |

| 18:45      | On LinkedIn, 86% of small businesses                              |
| 18:48      | get a qualified candidate within 24 hours.                        |
| 18:51      | Hire professionals like a professional on LinkedIn.               |
| 18:55      | LinkedIn also knows that small businesses                         |
| 18:57      | are wearing so many hats                                          |
| 18:59      | and might not have the time or resources to hire.                 |
| 19:02      | That's why they're constantly finding ways                        |
| 19:04      | to make the process easier.                                       |
| 19:06      | They even just launched a feature                                 |
| 19:08      | that helps you write job descriptions,                            |
| 19:10      | making the process even easier and quicker.                       |
| 19:13      | It's easy to see why 2.5 million small businesses                 |
| 19:17      | use LinkedIn for hiring.                                          |

| 19:30      | on the Automators Podcast.                                        |
| 19:31      | Terms and conditions apply.                                       |
| 19:33      | Thank you, LinkedIn, for all of your support                      |
| 19:36      | of the Automators Podcast.                                        |
| 19:40      | Okay, so Rose, we got the text into the system.                   |
| 19:44      | What are the ways these automators                                |
| 19:46      | use to automate that, the editing process?                        |
| 19:50      | Yeah, for me, it really depends on what it is                     |
| 19:53      | because if I've got something                                     |
| 19:55      | that sort of is vaguely tabular,                                  |
| 19:57      | then obviously I'm gonna be turning to something like [[Apple Notes\|Notes]],      |
| 20:01      | not [[Apple Notes\|Notes]], sorry, [[Numbers]].                                        |
| 20:03      | They both begin with N and they then are followed by a vowel.     |
| 20:06      | I'm having one of those days.                                     |
| 20:07      | But if I've got something tabular,                                |
| 20:09      | then I'll go to [[Numbers]] because it's already a table.             |
| 20:13      | I don't have to start generating tables and so on.                |
| 20:15      | And while [[Markdown]] tables in [[Drafts]] and [[Obsidian]] are great,       |
| 20:19      | there's something to be said for something                        |
| 20:21      | that is very much made for doing table editing,                   |
| 20:25      | isn't there?                                                      |
| 20:26      | But most of the time with text,                                   |
| 20:28      | because it's already started in [[Drafts]],                           |
| 20:30      | I'm gonna be going to [[Drafts]] to do more text processing.          |
| 20:34      | I have actions set up in [[Drafts]].                                  |
| 20:35      | I use workspaces and tags heavily.                                |
| 20:38      | So for example, whenever I am handling feedback for a show,       |
| 20:43      | I will copy it, I'll paste it into [[Drafts]]                         |
| 20:46      | and run an action to do a little bit of cleanup.                  |
| 20:49      | It will automatically add the tag relevant to the podcast         |
| 20:52      | and the actions and the action bar will be customised             |
| 20:55      | to doing the cleanup for those.                                   |
| 20:57      | So this doesn't happen so much for you, David,                    |
| 21:00      | because your name is David and that's a very common name.         |
| 21:02      | But something that happens with [[Mikah Sargent\|Mikah]],                            |
| 21:04      | [[Mikah Sargent]] on iOS today,                                       |
| 21:06      | is I get a lot of interesting spellings from [[Mikah Sargent\|Mikah]].               |
| 21:09      | Most common one is with a "C" instead of a "K",                       |
| 21:12      | but I have a nice little cleanup action                           |
| 21:16      | that one of the many things it does                               |
| 21:18      | is it finds all instances of "Micah" with a "C"                       |
| 21:20      | and replaces them with a "K"                                        |
| 21:22      | so that when we're looking at the show notes,                     |
| 21:23      | we're not distracted by names being spelt weirdly,                  |
| 21:26      | which is always quite nice.                                       |
| 21:28      | And so I do a lot of these things in [[Drafts]]                       |
| 21:31      | and it works incredibly well for me.                              |
| 21:35      | But sometimes I need to branch out a little bit more              |
| 21:37      | and so I'll reach for either [[BBEdit]] on my Mac.                   |
| 21:41      | In particular, the playgrounds for [[regular expressions]]            |
| 21:45      | are brilliant.                                                    |
| 21:47      | I genuinely love them.                                            |
| 21:49      | They make my day.                                                 |
| 21:49      | But it also has other great features such as the,                 |
| 21:54      | and I'm gonna get the name for this wrong                         |
| 21:56      | because I use it without remembering what it's called.            |
| 22:00      | But they've got the text workflows, I think they are.             |
| 22:04      | And so you can create a,                                            |
| 22:09      | Text Factory, that's the one.                                     |
| 22:11      | They have Text Factories                                          |
| 22:12      | where you can have a sequence of actions that happen.             |
| 22:17      | And it'll do things like sorting lines,                           |
| 22:19      | merging text, cleaning things up,                                 |
| 22:21      | converting things to [[XML]]                                          |
| 22:25      | or translating [[HTML]] back into text, vice versa.                   |
| 22:28      | All sorts of really good stuff.                                   |
| 22:30      | And so I tend to do quite a bit of that on macOS.                 |
| 22:34      | And sometimes I'll use [[Textastic]] on iOS                           |
| 22:38      | for a bit more processing as well.                                |
| 22:41      | But most of the time, I'm just sticking in [[Drafts]]                 |
| 22:44      | because it is a great way to just process things                  |
| 22:47      | and then I can send it off wherever it needs to go                |
| 22:49      | straight after.                                                   |
| 22:51      | I don't do as much coding as you.                                 |
| 22:53      | So I think my workflow is generally simpler.                      |
| 22:58      | I love [[Drafts]].                                                    |
| 22:59      | And the funny thing is we've been talking about [[Drafts]]            |
| 23:01      | on the show we've done full episodes on [[Drafts]].                   |
| 23:04      | We've had guests on who specialise in [[Drafts]].                     |
| 23:07      | And it just continues to be such a good tool for this.            |
| 23:11      | And there's a part of me that always wants to find                |
| 23:15      | the new and shiny and something better, right?                    |
| 23:18      | And I've looked at [[Tot]].                                          |
| 23:20      | [[Dr Drang]] did [a post](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2024/07/tot-notes/) on [[Tot]] a couple of months ago               |
| 23:23      | and I'm like, yeah, I should look at that.                        |
| 23:24      | It's got all these.                                               |
| 23:25      | His argument was that the limitations of the app                  |
| 23:28      | might make it more useful.                                        |
| 23:29      | And no, [[Tot]] doesn't work for me.                                 |
| 23:32      | And then I looked at [[Apple Notes]]                                  |
| 23:34      | because [[Apple Notes]] works so good in [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]],                  |
| 23:36      | but no, it's not good for me to write text.                       |
| 23:39      | And then [[Ulysses]] had an update                                    |
| 23:41      | and I always end up back in [[Drafts]].                               |
| 23:43      | So what I do is, and I talked about in the last segment,          |
| 23:47      | you know, how I'll dictate often a rough draft                    |
| 23:50      | and it goes into the [[Drafts]] inbox.                                |
| 23:53      | Well, then I tag them in [[Drafts]]                                   |
| 23:55      | and it's a very simple tagging system.                            |
| 23:58      | If something is still getting worked on,                          |
| 24:00      | it gets an active tag.                                            |
| 24:02      | And then there's a second tag that relates to the media           |
| 24:05      | that I'm really like, if I'm working on a blog post,              |
| 24:08      | it'll say blog.                                                   |
| 24:08      | If it's a newsletter, it'll say newsletter.                       |
| 24:11      | But at any one point in [[Drafts]], I can go in and filter tags       |
| 24:15      | in what they call workspaces in [[Drafts]]                            |
| 24:18      | and just say, okay, show me all the pending newsletters           |
| 24:21      | and where they stand.                                             |
| 24:22      | And there'll be bits of text I've dictated,                       |
| 24:24      | there'll be text I've worked on.                                  |
| 24:26      | And I just use [[Drafts]] as kind of my workbench for words           |
| 24:31      | and I go and I do, you know, old fashioned keyboard edits         |
| 24:37      | and go through and reread it and change words                     |
| 24:39      | and move things around.                                           |
| 24:40      | Like everybody's done since the beginning of time                 |
| 24:43      | that writes and I just find it really kind of good for that.      |
| 24:47      | I like that I can change the font and the look of [[Drafts]]          |
| 24:51      | so I can really kind of make it look the way I want.              |
| 24:54      | And I like that when I'm done with it,                            |
| 24:55      | I can use [[Drafts]], automations to do different things with it.     |
| 25:00      | Cause like I said earlier,                                        |
| 25:02      | I will use that button to dictate text in                         |
| 25:05      | for all sorts of things.                                          |
| 25:06      | It's not just like a deliverable,                                 |
| 25:08      | like a blog or a newsletter,                                      |
| 25:10      | it might be a lengthy email to an old friend                      |
| 25:14      | or an entry to my own kind of journal in day one                  |
| 25:20      | or maybe it's just an [[OmniFocus]] task.                             |
| 25:24      | I just do all sorts of different things with it                   |
| 25:25      | and [[Drafts]] gives me a very capable tool set                       |
| 25:30      | to export those to wherever they belong when I'm done.            |
| 25:34      | Yeah, I find the same thing.                                      |
| 25:35      | And also for the things that live in [[Drafts]]                       |
| 25:38      | because they are ephemeral, they don't stick around.              |
| 25:41      | I don't need to keep them                                         |
| 25:42      | because of the way that the workspaces work.                      |
| 25:45      | I can do that without having them cluttering up                   |
| 25:48      | the inbox in [[Drafts]],                                              |
| 25:50      | which is where all the things that don't have tags live.          |
| 25:52      | And that makes it incredibly easy for me                          |
| 25:54      | to just stay on top of things                                     |
| 25:56      | because I aspire for inbox zero.                                  |
| 25:59      | It is an ideal rather than a natural goal                         |
| 26:03      | because I know I'm not going to achieve it.                       |
| 26:04      | I would love to, but I rarely end up hitting inbox zero.          |
| 26:08      | But I do scan through the inbox on a regular basis.               |
| 26:11      | And anything that sits in the inbox is essentially,               |
| 26:14      | I haven't quite decided yet where this is going to go.            |
| 26:17      | And this applies to any and all systems.                          |
| 26:19      | But the fact that from [[Drafts]], I can hit a button                 |
| 26:21      | and it goes into omnifocus.                                       |
| 26:22      | I can hit a button and it goes to messages, blah, blah, blah.     |
| 26:25      | I've got all of those options for sharing.                        |
| 26:28      | So fun little bonus thing that you can do a text                  |
| 26:32      | that a friend and I were doing the other day                      |
| 26:34      | because we were sitting on the tarmac                             |
| 26:36      | on a plane waiting to take off.                                   |
| 26:39      | And we didn't really have phone signal.                           |
| 26:41      | So we were trying to message each other.                          |
| 26:43      | It wasn't going through.                                          |
| 26:44      | We were sat on opposite sides of the plane.                       |
| 26:45      | And they'd already done the security briefing                     |
| 26:49      | and then we're just sitting there waiting.                        |
| 26:50      | So we're trying to figure out                                     |
| 26:51      | how to communicate with each other.                               |
| 26:53      | And I get an airdrop notification.                                |
| 26:56      | And we were just using [[Drafts]] to message each other               |
| 26:58      | and [[AirDrop]] it back and forth to the other person.                |
| 27:01      | And you know what? It worked really well, you know,               |
| 27:04      | and it turned out to my further thinking of that                  |
| 27:07      | because, you know, I was there going,                             |
| 27:09      | hmm, you know, do I start using like semaphore Morse code?        |
| 27:12      | That's going to be really annoying                                |
| 27:13      | for the other people in the cabin.                                |
| 27:14      | They're going to be trying to figure out                          |
| 27:15      | what on earth is going on.                                        |
| 27:17      | And my semaphore is very rusty.                                   |
| 27:18      | And I don't know that my friend knows semaphore.                  |
| 27:20      | So [[AirDrop]] through [[Drafts]]                                         |
| 27:22      | was the correct solution to this problem.                         |
| 27:24      | And you know what?                                                |
| 27:25      | Because it was ephemeral,                                         |
| 27:26      | just deleted the messages afterwards.                             |
| 27:27      | And that worked great.                                            |
| 27:29      | So, you know, there's so many things that you can do with [[Drafts]]. |
| 27:32      | And I love the fact that text is so flexible.                     |
| 27:36      | You can use [[Markdown]], could use [[HTML]]                              |
| 27:39      | or any other kind of markup that you wanted to.                   |
| 27:44      | Or you can just keep it simple and write text                     |
| 27:47      | and then send it somewhere else later                             |
| 27:49      | and, you know, make it look pretty there.                         |
| 27:52      | One thing I will say is,                                          |
| 27:53      | once something leaves [[Drafts]],                                     |
| 27:54      | it very rarely goes back into [[Drafts]] for me.                      |
| 27:57      | So if something goes from [[Drafts]] to [[Obsidian]],                     |
| 27:59      | even if I then want to edit it                                    |
| 28:00      | and do a whole bunch of things,                                   |
| 28:02      | I'm not going to be taking it back into [[Drafts]]                    |
| 28:04      | and doing the editing.                                            |
| 28:05      | Like it'll be edited in whatever app it's in                      |
| 28:08      | from then onwards.                                                |
| 28:10      | Yeah. Yeah.                                                       |
| 28:11      | So we're very similar.                                            |
| 28:13      | Just a joke.                                                      |
| 28:14      | You should have sent your friend the [[Drafts]] code in binary.       |
| 28:18      | Just, you know, text binary.                                      |
| 28:20      | You know, zero one, zero one.                                     |
| 28:22      | I could have done,                                                |
| 28:24      | but I didn't think of that at the time.                           |
| 28:26      | And I'm not sure that my friend                                   |
| 28:28      | would have had the action installed to convert it back.           |
| 28:31      | So that would have been a little bit weird.                       |
| 28:34      | I have a [[TextExpander]] snippet.                                   |
| 28:36      | It's without a space.                                             |
| 28:38      | I just say binary.                                                |
| 28:39      | I type binary thanks and it types out thanks in binary.           |
| 28:43      | And I've never used it.                                           |
| 28:44      | Someday I want to send some nerd friend a thanks                  |
| 28:48      | with just that code and see if they figure it out.                |
| 28:51      | Maybe I'll do it to,                                              |
| 28:52      | well, now I can't do it to you.                                   |
| 28:53      | I've spoiled the gag,                                             |
| 28:55      | but I'm going to get that on somebody.                            |
| 28:58      | But it sounds to me like you and I use [[Drafts]]                     |
| 29:01      | very similarly with like kind of a transitory nature.             |
| 29:04      | I just use the built in,                                          |
| 29:06      | like there's an inbox and there's an archive.                     |
| 29:09      | And for me, like you,                                             |
| 29:11      | anything new goes in the inbox from dictation                     |
| 29:13      | or from me typing it.                                             |
| 29:15      | And once it gets tagged as a work in progress                     |
| 29:17      | and action thing somewhere,                                       |
| 29:18      | I archive it immediately.                                         |
| 29:20      | And the inbox is,                                                 |
| 29:22      | I try to keep it empty, you know, with tagged things.             |
| 29:24      | Now, then I do writing and editing in [[Drafts]].                     |
| 29:28      | And when it's done with that and it goes somewhere else,          |
| 29:31      | like a blog post example would go into [[Notion]]                     |
| 29:34      | because someone helps me get those [[Notion]] posts                   |
| 29:37      | up into [[WordPress]].                                                |
| 29:39      | That's it.                                                        |
| 29:39      | I never go back to [[Drafts]] with that thing.                        |
| 29:41      | And [[Drafts]] has got great, you know,                               |
| 29:44      | ways to turn into a text bank and storage.                        |
| 29:47      | And that's something kind of [[Greg Pierce\|Greg]] added                           |
| 29:49      | after the app took off,                                           |
| 29:51      | but it's just something I've never found myself using.            |
| 29:54      | And I think occasionally I do go through                          |
| 29:57      | and kind of blow out the archive                                  |
| 29:58      | and delete a bunch of it,                                         |
| 30:00      | but it's just a bunch of text files.                              |
| 30:02      | And, but there's just a real advantage                            |
| 30:05      | to having them that way.                                          |
| 30:06      | Like another really good text editor is [[IA Writer\|AI writer]][^2].                |
| 30:09      | It's gorgeous, but it's not multi doc friendly.                   |
| 30:12      | And at any time I've got like 20 of these active things           |
| 30:16      | I'm writing in here that I go and fiddle with.                    |
| 30:19      | And there's just nothing like [[Drafts]] to turn that up for me.      |
| 30:23      | I personally find that the archive feature in [[Drafts]]              |
| 30:26      | is great for things that I might want to keep around.             |
| 30:30      | So for example, packing lists.                                    |
| 30:32      | Once I'm done with the packing list,                              |
| 30:33      | I do not delete it, I archive it.                                 |
| 30:35      | Because if I am archiving it,                                     |
| 30:38      | then, you know, I have the ability to refer back to it,           |
| 30:40      | but most of the things I will then delete                         |
| 30:43      | and then they just pair permanently up to 30 days.                |
| 30:45      | So I have a little bit of a retention period                      |
| 30:46      | if I wanna go back in and fetch it and retrieve it later,         |
| 30:50      | but, you know, vast majority of the time,                         |
| 30:52      | if something's been deleted in [[Drafts]]                             |
| 30:53      | and I am a little aggressive with my actions in [[Drafts]]            |
| 30:57      | because each action you can choose                                |
| 30:59      | what should happen to the draft                                   |
| 31:00      | once you have executed the action.                                |
| 31:03      | So you can say, hey, leave it where it is,                        |
| 31:05      | send it to archive, delete it.                                    |
| 31:07      | A lot of mine are set to delete.                                  |
| 31:09      | Like a lot, a significant amount                                  |
| 31:12      | because that is what works for me,                                |
| 31:14      | but that is something that is worth playing with                  |
| 31:17      | for folks who are experimenting with [[Drafts]].                      |
| 31:18      | You know, you can set it up to archive things instead             |
| 31:21      | and so on and so forth, which is,                                 |
| 31:23      | I would say something that you should do                          |
| 31:26      | if you haven't played with that setting in [[Drafts]] yet             |
| 31:28      | on actions, you know, if you're using actions                     |
| 31:31      | to do things like reformat text and so on,                        |
| 31:33      | then obviously don't have it delete or archive                    |
| 31:35      | your draft as part of that.                                       |
| 31:37      | But if it's a send this off to [[OmniFocus]] or message this          |
| 31:40      | or send this as an email or save it to Notion,                    |
| 31:44      | consider archiving it or deleting it                              |
| 31:45      | as part of that action instead of making a multi,                 |
| 31:49      | instead of, you know, having another step in your workflow.       |
| 31:52      | Can we just move on to automation tools                           |
| 31:54      | in the editing process though, because again,                     |
| 31:56      | this is something that I feel like has changed over time.         |
| 32:00      | A big one for me is [[Grammarly]].                                    |
| 32:03      | I think it's just done a really good job of evolving              |
| 32:06      | in kind of the age of [[Artificial Intelligence\|AI]].                                         |
| 32:09      | If I had to put a percentage on it,                               |
| 32:11      | I'd say I accept about 30% of [[Grammarly]] recommendations.          |
| 32:15      | And in general, I'm looking for it to make my text                |
| 32:19      | a little cleaner, maybe a little shorter,                         |
| 32:21      | obviously catch grammar errors, but not change my voice.          |
| 32:26      | And I haven't been able to like train it what that means.         |
| 32:29      | So it's a little too aggressive                                   |
| 32:31      | and I have to turn down a lot of the suggestions,                 |
| 32:34      | but I do think that the step of going through [[Grammarly]]           |
| 32:37      | in my case makes the writing better.                              |
| 32:39      | Do you know anything like that?                                   |
| 32:41      | So I have experimented with [[Grammarly]]                             |
| 32:44      | and sometimes I use it, sometimes I don't.                        |
| 32:46      | I honestly mostly use it because not every text field,            |
| 32:51      | so I have it installed as a browser extension in [[Firefox]],         |
| 32:54      | which I use for work,                                             |
| 32:56      | not every text field has spell check built in.                    |
| 33:00      | And therefore [[Grammarly]] helps save the day                        |
| 33:03      | with that for the websites that I have enabled for.               |
| 33:07      | But I find most of the time I am better off                       |
| 33:11      | just leaving my text as it is                                     |
| 33:13      | because I rarely write something                                  |
| 33:15      | that needs to be viewed by a public entity.                       |
| 33:20      | Obviously, things I write for automators                          |
| 33:22      | and so on are viewed by a public entity,                          |
| 33:24      | but I tend to keep those very short                               |
| 33:26      | and so therefore I can check it myself.                           |
| 33:29      | But most of the time I find that the best thing to do             |
| 33:32      | is just get somebody else to prove read it                        |
| 33:34      | because [[Grammarly]] has opinions about grammar.                     |
| 33:38      | Sometimes I'm writing American English,                           |
| 33:40      | sometimes I'm writing British English                             |
| 33:41      | and switching between the two of them.                            |
| 33:43      | It's doable, but it gets really annoyed                           |
| 33:46      | if I've spelt colour with a U when it's set to American            |
| 33:48      | and I have to go through and change it                            |
| 33:49      | and that goes and highlights a whole bunch of other things.       |
| 33:52      | It's like, oh, but you should change this now.                    |
| 33:54      | And it's like, no, no, this is fine                               |
| 33:57      | because this is how I write                                       |
| 33:58      | because I flip back and forth                                     |
| 34:00      | between whatever English is working best for me                   |
| 34:02      | at that moment.                                                   |
| 34:04      | But yeah, I tend not to use it all that much, to be honest.       |
| 34:07      | It's great for spell checking,                                    |
| 34:09      | catching errant or completely missing commas and so on,           |
| 34:13      | but it's far from perfect.                                        |
| 34:15      | So I don't use it all that much at the moment.                    |
| 34:18      | And I mean, the closest I've come to using anything like that     |
| 34:23      | is when I'm building a list of things,                            |
| 34:27      | I might throw it at [[ChatGPT]] and say,                             |
| 34:28      | hey, what other things belong on this list                        |
| 34:32      | or something like that?                                           |
| 34:33      | Or are there any duplicates here?                                 |
| 34:35      | Because when I say look for duplicates,                           |
| 34:38      | I'm not talking about the fact that I've written,                 |
| 34:41      | you know, shampoo twice on my packing list.                       |
| 34:44      | I can spot that and clean those up automatically by myself        |
| 34:47      | or using my existing automations.                                 |
| 34:49      | I'm talking about if shampoo and hair shampoo are there,          |
| 34:52      | even if it's sorted alphabetically,                               |
| 34:53      | like if there's several things in between,                        |
| 34:55      | I might not spot that,                                            |
| 34:57      | but that's something that [[ChatGPT]] could find fairly quickly.     |
| 35:00      | Yeah, I do that too on big things.                                |
| 35:03      | Like the newsletter for me goes out to like 24,000 people.        |
| 35:07      | I am, if I'm doing something in there                             |
| 35:10      | that I feel like I'm a bit out on a limb,                         |
| 35:12      | I will throw the text at [[ChatGPT]] and say,                        |
| 35:16      | this is the point I'm trying to make, did I miss anything?        |
| 35:19      | And sometimes it will suggest things                              |
| 35:21      | that I think I did miss.                                          |
| 35:22      | It doesn't rewrite it for me,                                     |
| 35:24      | but just tells me topics that I should maybe cover.               |
| 35:27      | And that's kind of my limit.                                      |
| 35:28      | I wrote a newsletter about this a while ago,                      |
| 35:31      | but I am very much against having [[artificial intelligence]]         |
| 35:36      | actually write words for me.                                      |
| 35:37      | I just feel like there's just a part of me                        |
| 35:40      | that finds that very repellent.                                   |
| 35:44      | And I think it's just because I want my words out in the world,   |
| 35:48      | I don't want a robot word, you know?                              |
| 35:50      | It's just like, what's the point of my existence                  |
| 35:52      | if I don't write?                                                 |
| 35:53      | So I know that's getting deep,                                    |
| 35:55      | but I'm very kind of weird about that.                            |
| 35:57      | I call it the Sparky Language Model.                              |
| 35:59      | That's the stuff I write, that's the SLM.                         |
| 36:03      | But I do think it's still useful                                  |
| 36:07      | as an automation tool to find if you miss something               |
| 36:10      | and to do a grammar check and things like that.                   |
| 36:12      | Or even like formatting, like,                                    |
| 36:15      | I used to do a lot of like automation based formatting tools      |
| 36:19      | and I found that [[ChatGPT]]is so good at that.                     |
| 36:22      | Like recently, something went wrong in [[Whisper Memos]]            |
| 36:27      | and it didn't capitalise sentences.                               |
| 36:29      | Just like it did, I don't know why, right?                        |
| 36:32      | But it did a dictation for me.                                    |
| 36:33      | Everything was lowercase, you know?                               |
| 36:35      | It's like, there's no setting in the app to do that.              |
| 36:37      | Just like something went wrong in the [[Artificial Intelligence\|AI]]                          |
| 36:40      | and it just did a lowercase.                                      |
| 36:42      | So I just dropped it in to [[ChatGPT]] and I said,                   |
| 36:45      | you know, format the sentences                                    |
| 36:47      | with uppercase letters properly.                                  |
| 36:51      | And it did that, it went through                                  |
| 36:52      | and it also fixed proper nouns.                                   |
| 36:55      | It just like, it just did it, you know?                           |
| 36:57      | And I feel like, yeah, this is a good thing                       |
| 36:59      | that AI can do, like fix bad formatting.                          |
| 37:02      | Yes, yeah, no, that is good.                                      |
| 37:04      | I have used [[ChatGPT]] to generate text for me.                     |
| 37:07      | At one point, I took a bunch of silly hats into work              |
| 37:10      | when iOS today got rid of the app cap section.                    |
| 37:12      | A whole bunch of my colleagues have got kids                      |
| 37:14      | and so I gave the hats away to the kids                           |
| 37:17      | but it meant that all of us dressed up in silly hats              |
| 37:20      | for our morning stand up while we were in the office.             |
| 37:22      | And I ended up with the cat and the hat and gloves                |
| 37:25      | and somebody said, well, you should deliver                       |
| 37:27      | your daily update and stand up,                                   |
| 37:28      | which is what I did yesterday                                     |
| 37:29      | and what I'm doing today                                          |
| 37:31      | in the style of the cat and the hat.                              |
| 37:32      | And I'm familiar with the cat and the hat                         |
| 37:35      | but I couldn't create something off the cuff.                     |
| 37:38      | So I asked [[ChatGPT]] to do it for me                               |
| 37:40      | and then read it out after doing a little bit of tweaking         |
| 37:43      | to actually make it correct as to what I'd actually done          |
| 37:46      | because it took some liberties                                    |
| 37:47      | which would have not been helpful                                 |
| 37:49      | for my colleagues to know what I'd been doing.                    |
| 37:52      | And for that it was perfect                                       |
| 37:53      | but that was also a couple of sentences                           |
| 37:56      | to just be funny rather than to actually be my voice.             |
| 38:01      | And I think that that's the sort of thing                         |
| 38:02      | that is great for.                                                |
| 38:03      | If you're getting it to do that, that's great.                    |
| 38:05      | If you're getting it to write, you know                           |
| 38:06      | your entire annual, you know, update review or something          |
| 38:11      | that's a little bit different.                                    |
| 38:12      | And I think that's the point                                      |
| 38:14      | where you can start to lose your voice much more easily.          |
| 38:17      | Yeah, and I think people just need to figure out                  |
| 38:19      | where those lines are drawn for them.                             |
| 38:20      | [[Mike Schmitz]] told me they had like a pastor                       |
| 38:23      | at their church they did a big event for                          |
| 38:25      | and the guy loves baseball.                                       |
| 38:28      | So [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike]] and one of the parishioners announced the whole thing     |
| 38:34      | is if they were baseball announcers                               |
| 38:36      | and they wanted to insert commercials.                            |
| 38:37      | So they picked funny products                                     |
| 38:39      | and had [[ChatGPT]] right, add copy for them.                        |
| 38:42      | And like that totally makes sense to me.                          |
| 38:45      | But like I said, it's like if you're gonna put words out          |
| 38:47      | into the world about serious thoughts                             |
| 38:49      | should be your thoughts.                                          |
| 38:50      | And just to give you the short version of the argument            |
| 38:54      | I really think that by writing the words                          |
| 38:57      | it forces you to engage it.                                       |
| 38:58      | Like I feel like me writing an essay about something              |
| 39:02      | often refines my own thoughts about the thing.                    |
| 39:05      | And if I don't do the work                                        |
| 39:07      | then I don't refine my thoughts.                                  |
| 39:09      | I guess that's the short version of it.                           |
| 39:10      | Yes, yeah, yeah.                                                  |
| 39:12      | Like asking it to help you find where you've,                     |
| 39:15      | you know, redundancies in your texts                              |
| 39:16      | where you've said the same thing multiple times                   |
| 39:18      | so that you can clean it up.                                      |
| 39:19      | That's great.                                                     |
| 39:20      | That's like having a proofreader                                  |
| 39:21      | without having to actually, you know,                             |
| 39:23      | find somebody, wait for them to read it                           |
| 39:25      | and give you feedback and hope that they don't miss anything.     |
| 39:28      | I mean, you're still hoping that [[ChatGPT]]                         |
| 39:29      | or whatever [[Artificial Intelligence\|AI]] it is doesn't miss something                       |
| 39:32      | but it can be helpful as a first pass                             |
| 39:34      | so that then when you go to give this to an actual proofreader    |
| 39:38      | if it's something that important,                                 |
| 39:40      | then, you know, you've already done, you know                     |
| 39:42      | a couple of passes over it                                        |
| 39:44      | which can help you become a better writer                         |
| 39:46      | hopefully rather than it being the writer.                        |
| 39:50      | All right, I mentioned text processing                            |
| 39:52      | that there are apps and automation tools for that as well.        |
| 39:56      | Yeah, so I personally use a couple of apps                        |
| 40:00      | depending on what it is that I'm doing                            |
| 40:02      | and I mentioned [[Numbers]] before                                    |
| 40:03      | but I'm just gonna give another shout out to [[Numbers]] again.       |
| 40:05      | You've got like a list of things                                  |
| 40:07      | and you wanna do stuff with it, like, you know                    |
| 40:11      | if it contains, if the string contains                            |
| 40:13      | where it can't do this and so on.                                 |
| 40:14      | [[Numbers]] formulas are really great                                 |
| 40:17      | and I honestly love it for that sort of thing.                    |
| 40:22      | And then on top of that, I also use [[TextSoap]] and a [[MindNode]].    |
| 40:28      | So I will throw something into [[MindNode]]                          |
| 40:31      | and just have it sort of, you know, make it look pretty           |
| 40:35      | but that also because it changes the structure of the text        |
| 40:38      | it tricks my brain and seeing it a different way                  |
| 40:40      | and this is a very useful tool for me.                            |
| 40:43      | It may not be useful for everybody                                |
| 40:44      | but I love throwing something into [[MindNode]]                      |
| 40:46      | and, you know, it could be just like an indented list             |
| 40:49      | where you've got, you know, a couple of points                    |
| 40:51      | and then things, you know, span out from there                    |
| 40:53      | throwing that into [[MindNode]]                                      |
| 40:55      | and then just seeing what my brain comes up with                  |
| 40:57      | and the connections that it makes                                 |
| 40:58      | and then exporting that back to text afterwards.                  |
| 41:01      | That's something I do all the time                                |
| 41:03      | and I really love that.                                           |
| 41:05      | Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.                                |
| 41:07      | That is interesting.                                              |
| 41:07      | You see, [[MindNode]] for me is also kind of key                     |
| 41:10      | but it usually falls in at the very beginning                     |
| 41:14      | before I would start dictating, you know.                         |
| 41:16      | So [[MindNode]] is often kind of a planning step                     |
| 41:19      | or more complex dictation stuff.                                  |
| 41:22      | It does also have dictation built in, by the way.                 |
| 41:25      | That's something that was added to [[MindNode]]                      |
| 41:26      | not that long ago.                                                |
| 41:28      | I say not that long ago.                                          |
| 41:29      | It was at least a couple of versions ago                          |
| 41:31      | and a couple of years ago, but it's there.                        |
| 41:33      | So it can also be a great place where text starts.                |
| 41:35      | I just have a tendency to sort of                                 |
| 41:37      | verbally dump a list into [[Drafts]]                                  |
| 41:39      | and then I need to do some kind of organisation on it             |
| 41:42      | and I can do that as a text list                                  |
| 41:45      | but sometimes taking things out of their                          |
| 41:48      | neatly structured, this comes first,                              |
| 41:50      | this comes first, this comes first, you know,                     |
| 41:52      | and then second, third, fourth, et cetera,                        |
| 41:55      | really can just help my brain see where the holes are             |
| 41:58      | and that is quite useful, especially if you're, you know,         |
| 42:01      | trying to build an outline of some kind, seeing,                  |
| 42:03      | okay, well, these points are really, really heavy.                |
| 42:06      | These ones, there's only like two top level ones                  |
| 42:09      | but each of them have got 15 sub-level items.                     |
| 42:12      | So maybe I need to split that up a bit more                       |
| 42:14      | and can I refine that and improve that?                           |
| 42:17      | It's quite useful for seeing things that way.                     |
| 42:19      | I just love this app, my notes so much.                           |
| 42:22      | I don't know, it's not even like entirely rational.               |
| 42:25      | I like their balance of complexity versus simplicity              |
| 42:30      | and I've dealt with the developers over the years,                |
| 42:33      | they're very nice people over in I think Austria.                 |
| 42:36      | Yes, they are, they're in Vienna.                                 |
| 42:38      | And they're just so dedicated to making this a great app          |
| 42:41      | and all the changes they make,                                    |
| 42:43      | while they may not be super big,                                  |
| 42:46      | they're always like moving it forward.                            |
| 42:49      | Another thing they've done in this app is,                        |
| 42:50      | this is years old now is that it has an outliner built in.        |
| 42:53      | So like you can view it as a my note                              |
| 42:56      | or an outline right in the single app.                            |
| 42:59      | But, you know, I'd never really thought about it                  |
| 43:01      | from the automation tool, the way you do.                         |
| 43:05      | And that is absolutely correct, you know?                         |
| 43:09      | Here's a workflow.                                                |
| 43:11      | If you're working on a problem,                                   |
| 43:13      | make a [[MindNode]] of it and make it full screen on your Mac          |
| 43:17      | and just be able to swipe over it to occasionally                 |
| 43:19      | and add to it and then go back                                    |
| 43:21      | and just, it's almost like cooking in the background.             |
| 43:24      | I do that all the time and it's just so useful.                   |
| 43:26      | Yes, yeah, I also wanna give them a shout out                     |
| 43:29      | because in the footnote of their web page                          |
| 43:33      | where they've got the features list, download list,               |
| 43:35      | release notes, themes, they also have accessibility,              |
| 43:38      | which is such a huge thing                                        |
| 43:40      | because there are a lot of listeners to Automators                |
| 43:43      | and other podcasts on the Relay network                           |
| 43:45      | and elsewhere who want or need accessible apps.                   |
| 43:49      | And the fact that they have accessibility                         |
| 43:51      | as, you know, a top level menu entry on their website             |
| 43:53      | and they work really hard to make it accessible is great.         |
| 43:56      | And since I thought, which is an app that I was using             |
| 44:00      | for more diagrammy thought processing                             |
| 44:04      | rather than thoughts spreading out,                               |
| 44:07      | I understand that those sound like two things,                    |
| 44:10      | but in my mind they are very different.                           |
| 44:12      | I thought is no longer very sadly.                                |
| 44:15      | So now I just basically do everything in my node                  |
| 44:18      | and it is even to an extent for me replacing things               |
| 44:20      | like [[Taskheat]], which I've used before                            |
| 44:23      | for trying to figure out dependencies in workflows                |
| 44:26      | for tasks and so on.                                              |
| 44:27      | It's [[Taskheat]] is still around,                                   |
| 44:29      | [[Taskheat]] is still a great app,                                   |
| 44:30      | but I found that honestly,                                        |
| 44:32      | I can get everything into [[MindNode]]                                 |
| 44:33      | and the fact that it also has that integration                    |
| 44:35      | with [[OmniFocus]] is a significant improvement for me.               |
| 44:38      | Rose, earlier you mentioned that when the text leaves [[Drafts]],     |
| 44:44      | often it goes to a new place of residence.                        |
| 44:48      | What is that new place of residence for you?                      |
| 44:50      | Where do you send your text?                                      |
| 44:54      | I mean, can you try a question                                    |
| 44:55      | that does not involve the entirety                                |
| 44:57      | of the Encyclopaedia Britannica to answer?                         |
| 45:00      | Because there's quite a few options to be honest                  |
| 45:03      | and it really depends on what it is.                              |
| 45:06      | So the other day, a friend sent me a recipe                       |
| 45:09      | for lime cordial, okay?                                           |
| 45:10      | Great recipe, loved it, tried it.                                 |
| 45:12      | I've now got a lot of lime cordial in my fridge.                  |
| 45:14      | To be fair, I had a lot of limes beforehand                       |
| 45:16      | and they were gonna go off.                                       |
| 45:17      | So this is probably an improvement                                |
| 45:18      | because lime cordial lasts for about three months.                |
| 45:20      | So my friend texted this to me, okay, in messages,                |
| 45:23      | but I message, same difference.                                   |
| 45:25      | So I copied it and threw it into [[Drafts]]                           |
| 45:27      | and did a little bit of tweaking and reformatting                 |
| 45:29      | and that ended up in [[Crouton]].                                     |
| 45:31      | Well, that's a bit of a rarity for me,                            |
| 45:32      | but [[Crouton]] is a great app for storing recipes.                   |
| 45:35      | So that was the right place.                                      |
| 45:37      | But most of the time when my text leaves [[Drafts]],                  |
| 45:40      | it's probably going to go to either an app or a person            |
| 45:46      | so it could go to [[Messages]] or [[Apple Mail\|Mail]] or [[OmniFocus]], for example,     |
| 45:51      | or it's gonna go, and that's an action thing,                     |
| 45:55      | or it's gonna go into storage.                                    |
| 45:57      | And storage generally for me means [[Obsidian]],                      |
| 46:00      | but sometimes it means [[DEVONthink]],                             |
| 46:02      | depending on the likelihood of me editing it again.               |
| 46:06      | So if it's going to be a living document,                         |
| 46:09      | something that I'm gonna be editing frequently potentially        |
| 46:13      | and so on, then it is going into [[Obsidian]].                        |
| 46:16      | If it is a reference document like I've created it,               |
| 46:19      | I may at some point need to edit it                               |
| 46:21      | and update it in the future,                                      |
| 46:23      | but it's basically this is not quite set in stone,                |
| 46:28      | but it's getting close to that.                                   |
| 46:29      | It goes into dev and think,                                       |
| 46:31      | which means it's gonna live with all the things                   |
| 46:33      | like my washing machine manuals and so on and so forth.           |
| 46:37      | And I know that sounds a very dorky perhaps definition            |
| 46:42      | of what the difference is between the two,                        |
| 46:44      | but [[Obsidian]] is my wiki.                                          |
| 46:47      | So I will edit that and update that                               |
| 46:49      | and change that on a regular basis.                               |
| 46:51      | But for things that don't really change,                          |
| 46:53      | which is why it's more things                                     |
| 46:54      | like washing machine manuals and so on,                           |
| 46:56      | it goes into [[DEVONthink]].                                       |
| 46:58      | So when I found out the steps that I needed to do                 |
| 47:02      | to change the time zone on my robot vacuum                        |
| 47:05      | for spring and summer, or sorry,                                  |
| 47:08      | for summertime and wintertime,                                    |
| 47:11      | I saved that into [[DEVONthink]],                                  |
| 47:12      | because that's, I mean, that may change                           |
| 47:14      | if the app changes and all of that,                               |
| 47:16      | or if they figure out that they can do this automatically,        |
| 47:19      | which they absolutely could,                                      |
| 47:20      | but that's a problem for another time,                            |
| 47:22      | then I can edit it,                                               |
| 47:24      | but it's unlikely that that's gonna change anytime soon.          |
| 47:26      | So I put that into [[DEVONthink]].                                 |
| 47:28      | But the reference list of things                                  |
| 47:30      | that I need to update for the new time zone                       |
| 47:33      | when time zones change, that lives in [[Obsidian]]                    |
| 47:36      | because I can link to a [[DEVONthink]] note from [[Obsidian]]          |
| 47:40      | and that's fine.                                                  |
| 47:41      | It just so happened that that's how my brain works.               |
| 47:44      | Yeah, I have a collection too.                                    |
| 47:46      | Largely, my usage for you matches [[Obsidian]], [[DEVONthink]].         |
| 47:50      | [[DEVONthink]] is for me, often though,                            |
| 47:53      | not tech so much as other assets,                                 |
| 47:56      | like the actual washing machine manual is a good example.         |
| 47:59      | Yes, exactly.                                                     |
| 48:01      | But I also, because I make things too complex,                    |
| 48:04      | I have a third one and that's [[Apple Notes]]                         |
| 48:06      | and that is for what I would call true [[Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]],                       |
| 48:11      | [[personal knowledge management]] text,                               |
| 48:14      | like I have one for the dog.                                      |
| 48:17      | When we go to the vet,                                            |
| 48:18      | I've got an Apple Note that lists every visit.                    |
| 48:20      | We've made all the shots she's had and stuff like that            |
| 48:24      | because I just find [[Apple Notes]] is really easy                    |
| 48:27      | when you're on an iPhone at a vet's office                        |
| 48:29      | to get information like that.                                     |
| 48:31      | So I've moved that out and I kind of treat my [[Obsidian]] data       |
| 48:35      | as more sacred because it's like my most intimate                 |
| 48:38      | thoughts and ideas and I really like that                         |
| 48:40      | to be focused on that.                                            |
| 48:41      | But like you, [[Drafts]] is a holding place.                          |
| 48:46      | Another thing is often the stuff I write is a deliverable.        |
| 48:50      | It's gonna be a newsletter, a blog post,                          |
| 48:52      | a MacSparky Labs thing and that goes into the system            |
| 48:56      | that publishes those.                                             |
| 48:58      | And I don't keep that stuff around                                |
| 49:00      | because it gets published and I move on.                          |
| 49:02      | I can only keep so much stuff.                                    |
| 49:05      | But I do also have storage locations                              |
| 49:08      | kind of depending on context.                                     |
| 49:10      | But you added a couple apps to the outline that I don't use.      |
| 49:14      | So tell me about [[Snippety]] and [[Cheatsheet Sticky Note Widget\|Cheatsheet]].                        |
| 49:17      | So [[Cheatsheet Sticky Note Widget\|Cheatsheet]] is a great app for, hey, what hotel room           |
| 49:22      | am I in at the moment?                                            |
| 49:23      | And where is it?                                                  |
| 49:25      | Just because something is called Hotel Room 1345                  |
| 49:29      | does not mean it's on the 13th floor.                             |
| 49:31      | It could be on, it could actually be on any floor.                |
| 49:35      | In this particular case, it was on floor three.                   |
| 49:37      | Don't ask me how, but it was on floor three                       |
| 49:39      | and you went left out the lift or elevator                        |
| 49:42      | when you got there.                                               |
| 49:43      | And so for things like that, I'll store that in [[Cheatsheet Sticky Note Widget\|Cheatsheet]]       |
| 49:46      | because then I can add those widgets to my home screen.           |
| 49:50      | And I do have a travel home screen,                               |
| 49:54      | which I tend to use it while I'm actually flying                  |
| 49:58      | or transiting rather than the entire time that I'm on a trip.     |
| 50:01      | But it means that when I get in the lift,                         |
| 50:03      | I can just be like, okay, switch to travel mode,                  |
| 50:06      | look at my lock screen, that's my room number                     |
| 50:08      | and go back, done.                                                |
| 50:10      | Or look at my home screen actually                                |
| 50:11      | because I decided that it could be potentially                    |
| 50:13      | a safety risk to have my hotel room                               |
| 50:15      | on the lock screen on my phone.                                   |
| 50:17      | So I have some other information there instead.                   |
| 50:20      | But the other apps that I use,                                    |
| 50:23      | because sometimes I have text                                     |
| 50:25      | and that text is for consistent reuse.                            |
| 50:28      | Now, it's easy enough on Mac OS                                   |
| 50:30      | to use things like [[TextExpander]] and so on.                       |
| 50:32      | And it does exist on iOS,                                         |
| 50:33      | but I found that what I really wanted                             |
| 50:36      | was more of a keyboard on iOS,                                    |
| 50:39      | where I could just be going through                               |
| 50:41      | and just tap tap, select something                                |
| 50:43      | and here's a block of text.                                       |
| 50:45      | And it can do things like insert my clipboard                     |
| 50:48      | or the current selection and so on and so forth.                  |
| 50:50      | So for that, I use [[Snippety]].                                      |
| 50:53      | And [[Snippety]] is a great app.                                      |
| 50:55      | I think it was a one-time purchase.                               |
| 50:57      | It may have been a separate purchase from Mac OS versus iOS.      |
| 50:59      | I don't exactly remember it, but it was very affordable.          |
| 51:02      | I wanna say it was less than $10.                                 |
| 51:04      | And that allows me to just insert blocks of text                  |
| 51:08      | into whatever I'm typing, wherever I'm typing.                    |
| 51:12      | And still have the full iOS keyboard the rest of the time         |
| 51:16      | because the problem I found with [[TextExpander]]                    |
| 51:18      | and I definitely need to play with this again                     |
| 51:21      | because I know that they have worked on this                      |
| 51:22      | as the [[TextExpander]] keyboard.                                    |
| 51:24      | For me, the tap targets were ever so slightly off                 |
| 51:26      | or something like that.                                           |
| 51:28      | And it just didn't feel like it was working                       |
| 51:31      | as a keyboard particularly well.                                  |
| 51:33      | But I will say it's been a good couple of years                   |
| 51:35      | since I've really tried that in earnest.                          |
| 51:36      | So I should definitely give that another go.                      |
| 51:39      | Cool, cool, I wasn't aware of [[Cheatsheet Sticky Note Widget\|Cheatsheet]] because                 |
| 51:43      | there's an old Mac app called [[CheatSheet]]                         |
| 51:45      | that gives you a list of keyboard shortcuts.                      |
| 51:48      | So I didn't even realise this iOS version existed,                |
| 51:51      | but the idea is it gives you a widget                             |
| 51:53      | with simple and often accessed information.                       |
| 51:58      | Looking at it, I was thinking,                                    |
| 51:59      | I could see myself using that even for productivity things        |
| 52:02      | like my quarterly goals,                                          |
| 52:04      | just to keep it on my home screen all the time,                   |
| 52:07      | stuff like that.                                                  |
| 52:08      | Exactly, like it's great for things                               |
| 52:10      | that you want quick and easy reference to                         |
| 52:13      | on a regular basis or for a short period of time.                 |
| 52:16      | So for example, I went to a restaurant a while ago                |
| 52:19      | and a friend had been there recently.                             |
| 52:22      | And so I just created a quick [[Cheatsheet Sticky Note Widget\|Cheatsheet]] note                    |
| 52:25      | with the name of the restaurant                                   |
| 52:26      | and what my friend had recommended                                |
| 52:27      | and went there, ate it, enjoyed things.                           |
| 52:30      | And I was just able to quickly look at the widget                 |
| 52:33      | on my home screen to see what that was.                           |
| 52:34      | And I could have put that in [[Drafts]],                              |
| 52:36      | but I could have put that in [[DEVONthink]].                         |
| 52:38      | I could have put that in [[Obsidian]].                                |
| 52:39      | I could have put it in any number of places,                      |
| 52:41      | but for me, cheat sheet is just a,                                |
| 52:43      | this is a quick reference thing.                                  |
| 52:45      | It may stick around for a while,                                  |
| 52:47      | but it's not a problem if it does                                 |
| 52:49      | because then I'll see it again later                              |
| 52:52      | and be able to reference back to that                             |
| 52:55      | as I would like to or not as the case may be.                     |
| 52:59      | Platform usage, what do you do most of your text writing on?      |
| 53:04      | Where does most of this work get done?                            |
| 53:07      | This is a tricky question                                         |
| 53:08      | because the answer is it varies.                                  |
| 53:11      | And so I dictate basically almost exclusively                     |
| 53:17      | on my [[Apple Watch]].                                                |
| 53:19      | So when I'm in the car,                                           |
| 53:21      | I have a widget or complication rather on my watch screen,        |
| 53:25      | which I can tap on and it just launches                           |
| 53:27      | into [[Drafts]] dictation and bam,                                    |
| 53:29      | I can dictate a note and off you go.                              |
| 53:31      | That's it, very simple.                                           |
| 53:33      | Then for text editing,                                            |
| 53:37      | it depends on the length of the text.                             |
| 53:39      | So if it's short, I'll quite happily do it on my iPhone.          |
| 53:43      | If it's medium to long, it could be my iPad.                      |
| 53:47      | I especially like the fact that with the iPad,                    |
| 53:49      | you can pick it up and put it in portrait mode.                   |
| 53:51      | And that is really good for scrolling                             |
| 53:53      | a longer list of text, but still being quite portable.            |
| 53:57      | And if it's big, if this is a multiple page document,             |
| 54:02      | then I'm also gonna do it on the Mac                              |
| 54:04      | because yeah, big text requires big screen, keyboard,             |
| 54:08      | mouse and also the mental space                                   |
| 54:11      | of I'm sitting in a comfortable chair ergonomically               |
| 54:14      | and I am ready to do this.                                        |
| 54:16      | Now, this is also quite a good trick                              |
| 54:18      | for sometimes I need to make myself think more about a thing.     |
| 54:21      | So I'll sit down at my desk to do it and go from there.           |
| 54:24      | But that's generally how I process text across platforms.         |
| 54:28      | What about you, David?                                            |
| 54:29      | Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty agnostic.                            |
| 54:33      | I can do it on most apps.                                         |
| 54:36      | I do a lot of dictation into the watch.                           |
| 54:38      | I also do it into the phone.                                      |
| 54:40      | Sorry, gang about my voice, it really is rough.                |
| 54:43      | The reason [[Drafts]] is so critical, I think for both of us,         |
| 54:47      | is because it is everywhere.                                      |
| 54:48      | And it's just like so easy to even use my small iPad Pro          |
| 54:54      | with an attached keyboard.                                        |
| 54:55      | And because I've got that system                                  |
| 54:58      | where they're all indexed for me,                                 |
| 55:00      | I do like going out of the house once in a while                  |
| 55:02      | with just my iPad and fixing text with those things.              |
| 55:06      | Another place I really like doing it                              |
| 55:08      | is Yosemite Valley with my [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]].                            |
| 55:11      | And it's awesome to go into that context switch.                  |
| 55:15      | I wish [[Drafts]] had a native [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]] app.                        |
| 55:20      | I haven't bugged the [[Drafts]] developer about this in a while,      |
| 55:24      | but I think he was thinking about it                              |
| 55:26      | when they first released it.                                      |
| 55:27      | I don't know where that stands.                                   |
| 55:28      | Currently, you're basically running the iPad version.             |
| 55:31      | And the problem is the touch targets are too small.               |
| 55:33      | And it just doesn't work that well in [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]]                  |
| 55:36      | if it's on a native app.                                          |
| 55:37      | But that's fine.                                                  |
| 55:38      | I have a keyboard and an attached trackpad                        |
| 55:41      | and that solves the problem.                                      |
| 55:44      | And I work in [[Drafts]] all the time in [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]]                   |
| 55:47      | in that kind of writing environment.                              |
| 55:49      | So I move around a lot.                                           |
| 55:51      | I do pick tools intentionally                                     |
| 55:53      | to be able to do this anywhere                                    |
| 55:55      | because I find, you know, wrestling with text is hard.            |
| 55:58      | It's, you know, to make your best words takes effort.             |
| 56:02      | And sometimes you need to move your body somewhere else.          |
| 56:04      | Sometimes, you know, like with my family,                         |
| 56:08      | sometimes we just have family events                              |
| 56:10      | where I get drawn away for a day.                                 |
| 56:12      | But I may have two hours of downtime when we go away.             |
| 56:15      | And I can go work on my text and [[Drafts]] on an iPad.               |
| 56:19      | But I would say that I do most of the hard,                       |
| 56:22      | heavy lifting on a Mac.                                           |
| 56:23      | But I really do, [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]] is really an up and comer for me      |
| 56:28      | in terms of text editing.                                         |
| 56:30      | Yes, yeah.                                                        |
| 56:31      | I tried [[Apple Vision Pro]].                                         |
| 56:33      | I went to the [[Apple]] store here in the UK.                         |
| 56:35      | And I tried it and I love it.                                     |
| 56:37      | I do really love it.                                              |
| 56:40      | I just don't think that I can justify one yet                     |
| 56:42      | because eight hours a day,                                        |
| 56:44      | I'm sitting at a computer and I need the computer.                |
| 56:48      | I need the multiple screens.                                      |
| 56:49      | And I know I can pull the computer screen into [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]].        |
| 56:53      | But that feels to me like                                         |
| 56:54      | that's going to be a less ergonomic experience                    |
| 56:56      | due to the weight of the [[Apple Vision Pro\|Vision Pro]] on my face.                   |
| 56:59      | It did fit incredibly well                                        |
| 57:01      | when I went to the [[Apple]] store and tried it on.                   |
| 57:03      | But I also only had what, a 20, 30 minute demo.                   |
| 57:07      | And I couldn't feel it pulling on my head to be fair.             |
| 57:09      | It was very comfortable.                                          |
| 57:11      | But I just don't think I can justify it just yet.                 |
| 57:14      | I would love to.                                                  |
| 57:16      | But I'm not sure that I'm there right now                         |
| 57:18      | to be able to really give that a go.                              |
| 57:21      | So I'm going to have to wait and see.                             |
| 57:24      | But you know, who knows what will happen                          |
| 57:26      | in a couple of days at that [[Apple]] event.                          |
| 57:29      | We will have to, I mean,                                          |
| 57:31      | if you're an Automator's Max subscriber,                          |

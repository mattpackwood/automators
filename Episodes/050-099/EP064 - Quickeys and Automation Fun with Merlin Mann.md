| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by my fellow co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                    |
| 00:07      | And we are here to talk about automating your technology to do your work for you.                             |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rosemary, how are you today?                                                                           |
| 00:14      | I'm feeling very productive, David.                                                                           |
| 00:16      | I have a series of 43 folders in front of me.                                                                 |
| 00:18      | Oh, do you?                                                                                                   |
| 00:19      | Well, that's very convenient.                                                                                 |
| 00:20      | I do.                                                                                                         |
| 00:21      | Because we have a guest today who is one of my very favourite people on the Internet.                          |
| 00:25      | Welcome to the show, Merlin Mann.                                                                              |
| 00:26      | Hi, David.                                                                                                    |
| 00:27      | I have like probably two or three folders left.                                                               |
| 00:30      | I don't have a lot in me, but I'm also feeling very productive and I'm excited to be here.                    |
| 00:34      | I learned so much from you people and it's a thrill to be here.                                               |
| 00:38      | Thank you.                                                                                                    |
| 00:39      | Thank you for coming.                                                                                         |
| 00:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 00:41      | Well, you've been on the list for too long, so we're really, really happy that you could                      |
| 00:45      | find time to join us.                                                                                         |
| 00:48      | Merlin is a guy who thinks about a lot of stuff in terms of productivity, but also I think                    |
| 00:54      | really, you get the balance right for automation.                                                             |
| 00:57      | You're one of the people that I look up to in this, that automation is important, but                         |
| 01:02      | you don't want to get lost in it, and I always feel like you seem to find that sweet spot.                    |
| 01:06      | I eventually find the sweet spot after I have spent too much time on something, and I do                      |
| 01:10      | have some good cautionary tales for you this week.                                                            |
| 01:13      | But no, it's really so interesting as I was getting prepared to visit with you all.                           |
| 01:19      | I was thinking about all the things that I use and increasingly how much stuff gets automated                 |
| 01:25      | for me, but I still want to get that last mile of getting it the way I want, and I'll                         |
| 01:31      | spend a week on it, and then just going back to the old ways, but God, what a time.                           |
| 01:36      | There's so much exciting stuff right now.                                                                     |
| 01:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:39      | It is a lot easier than it used to be, isn't it?                                                              |
| 01:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:43      | I think so.                                                                                                   |
| 01:44      | One of the questions I may not want to jump ahead is your show, but you were asking me                        |
| 01:48      | stuff like, what's the first automation thing I used on a Mac or early things?                                |
| 01:54      | I cannot find this to save my life, but I believe it was called Quick Keys, and there                         |
| 01:59      | was this app that you could run that would do, in some ways, it's a little bit like the                       |
| 02:04      | way that I would use, for example, the way you all use Keyboard Maestro, the way that                         |
| 02:10      | I use [[BetterTouchTool]], but all the way down to wait this many seconds, and then click                       |
| 02:16      | in this area, and you could create all these really wackadoo macros and Rube Goldberg devices,                |
| 02:23      | but it was a real crapshoot if it would work at all, and that's still true in some ways                       |
| 02:29      | today, but now there's an entire community of people like Rosemary, like all these other                      |
| 02:34      | folks that are making the fellow that made the ThoughtAsylum thing for Drafts, there's                       |
| 02:38      | people out there just making an entire worldview inside of these apps that we get to benefit                  |
| 02:43      | from.                                                                                                         |
| 02:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 02:45      | I agree.                                                                                                      |
| 02:46      | I agree.                                                                                                      |
| 02:47      | And like the stuff you're talking about is a lot of the stuff I do is the UI scripting                        |
| 02:52      | where you literally tell it, click this box, which does feel very tenuous, but when it                        |
| 02:58      | works, it's a beautiful thing.                                                                                |
| 03:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 03:01      | I mean, that's how I started the show today, David.                                                           |
| 03:04      | Keyboard Maestro opened Audio Hijack, waited for the right window to appear, and then clicked                 |
| 03:08      | an image to find the right session, because there's no scripting support other than opening                   |
| 03:12      | the application.                                                                                              |
| 03:13      | So I had to click at the image that it found.                                                                 |
| 03:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 03:16      | But it's all happening right alongside, for example, God, I had to do something with actually                 |
| 03:21      | a [[Brett Terpstra]] thing.                                                                                      |
| 03:22      | I had to use a, to log into the multi-markdown site for the NV Ultra beta.                                    |
| 03:28      | And I didn't get a, I got a different kind of capture, but I think captures have like                         |
| 03:32      | run out of things.                                                                                            |
| 03:33      | And now they're just testing my brain where it's like, pick the traffic light.                                |
| 03:37      | I'm like, those aren't traffic lights.                                                                        |
| 03:38      | Those are signal lights for a train.                                                                          |
| 03:41      | And I know that is not a crosswalk.                                                                           |
| 03:42      | If someone tries to cross there, they will die.                                                               |
| 03:45      | That's just dashed lines.                                                                                     |
| 03:47      | Please do not use, don't let your smart robot use my incorrect thing that I said to get                       |
| 03:54      | into the website in order to like, it's not going to produce a safer world.                                   |
| 03:58      | But yeah, I don't think the robots are running everything yet, but you know, you never know.                  |
| 04:01      | It could be a simulation.                                                                                     |
| 04:02      | I don't know.                                                                                                 |
| 04:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 04:04      | Well, the thing that always gets me is, is the pole holding up the traffic light, part                        |
| 04:08      | of the traffic light.                                                                                         |
| 04:09      | Oh, right.                                                                                                    |
| 04:10      | Or like, like when you say like, select all the motor coaches and it's like, well, that's                     |
| 04:15      | actually like a train, like an above ground train.                                                            |
| 04:18      | And Jon Sriacusa and, I have talked about this a lot where it's like, I think I know what you                         |
| 04:21      | want me to guess, but I do feel like there's a certain cost associated with getting this                      |
| 04:25      | wrong.                                                                                                        |
| 04:26      | I have all kinds of things like my phone or 1Password that'll lock me out.                                 |
| 04:29      | If I'm, if I don't get it right, I'm like, I feel so much anxiety just logging into a                         |
| 04:34      | website because the robot told me to get something wrong.                                                     |
| 04:37      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                      |
| 04:38      | It is like a whole thing.                                                                                     |
| 04:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 04:40      | Like when you don't select it because it is wrong and then it won't let you pass unless                       |
| 04:44      | you say that the train is a bus and you know, they're going, but this isn't, this isn't                       |
| 04:49      | a bus.                                                                                                        |
| 04:50      | It's a train.                                                                                                 |
| 04:51      | They're very different things.                                                                                |
| 04:52      | They're just gaslighting us.                                                                                  |
| 04:53      | They're just gaslighting us.                                                                                  |
| 04:54      | This is how they're going to win.                                                                             |
| 04:55      | They're going to just get us used to saying things that we know are wrong.                                    |
| 04:57      | The robot knows it's right.                                                                                   |
| 04:58      | They're just testing it.                                                                                      |
| 04:59      | They're seeing how far they can go.                                                                           |
| 05:00      | Check back in a year because I think it's going to be a really bad scene.                                     |
| 05:03      | It's going to be very Skynet.                                                                                 |
| 05:04      | Well, let's see if we can fix that with Shortcuts shall we?                                                     |
| 05:07      | All right.                                                                                                    |
| 05:08      | Let's do this.                                                                                                |
| 05:09      | At what point though, Merlin, did you start thinking about automation as something you                        |
| 05:14      | want to do?                                                                                                   |
| 05:17      | Hmm.                                                                                                          |
| 05:18      | I mean, just in a very general sense, the way that I would put this now that's, I don't                       |
| 05:23      | know, might sound a little bit silly, I think one way to think about this stuff is in terms                   |
| 05:28      | of if you like friction, right?                                                                               |
| 05:31      | And like this does kind of key into like the 43 folder is creative work approach, which                       |
| 05:35      | is that like, you know, the reason that you get the big bucks is because you can solve                        |
| 05:39      | a certain kind of problem or you can think in a certain way.                                                  |
| 05:42      | And there are necessary, there's a kind of necessary friction, a necessary difficulty                         |
| 05:47      | to any knowledge work job, I think it might sound kind of obvious, but I think that's                         |
| 05:52      | really true.                                                                                                  |
| 05:53      | Now, the key to that becomes, how do I reduce unnecessary friction, unnecessary effort, unnecessary           |
| 06:01      | duplication of effort?                                                                                        |
| 06:02      | How do I develop the wisdom to know when that friction is my job?                                             |
| 06:07      | And when that friction is something that's preventing me from doing my job, it doesn't                        |
| 06:10      | matter where your job is.                                                                                     |
| 06:11      | I mean, I talk into a microphone, but that's still, that's what I do.                                         |
| 06:15      | So how do I make time for good friction while working to efficiently eliminate unnecessary                    |
| 06:23      | friction?                                                                                                     |
| 06:24      | Does that make sense?                                                                                         |
| 06:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 06:26      | Yeah, that definitely does because I have that all the time at work.                                          |
| 06:29      | So I've been programming a lot of things with a framework recently, and the framework                         |
| 06:33      | includes a feature which can generate a bunch of stuff, but to start with, it was necessary                   |
| 06:38      | for me to manually go ahead and create this.                                                                  |
| 06:40      | So I actually learned properly how everything worked.                                                         |
| 06:43      | And now I'm okay to go ahead and use the generator because I understand what magic it's doing                 |
| 06:47      | behind the scenes.                                                                                            |
| 06:48      | But if I hadn't taken the time to, you know, go through all of that friction at the start,                    |
| 06:52      | then I wouldn't necessarily understand exactly what was happening where, and well, my results                 |
| 06:57      | would not be up to standard because I hadn't done that extra work.                                            |
| 07:01      | So I definitely get what you mean there.                                                                      |
| 07:03      | And it also keys into, I think, a very important, it's not a primary purpose of getting things                |
| 07:10      | done, but I actually remember this fairly specifically, I'll humble Bragg who's having                        |
| 07:14      | dinner with David and his wife, and we were talking about, you know, the ability to automate.                 |
| 07:19      | And he waxed poetic about his days trying to create the ultimate Palm Pilot app for                           |
| 07:24      | doing productivity and the challenge of like, he's always been very skeptical of these apps                   |
| 07:29      | that do too much automation.                                                                                  |
| 07:31      | And the reason I think that's important is that once you really get into some kind of                         |
| 07:34      | a system, whether that's getting things done or whatever that is watering your plants, there                  |
| 07:38      | is an impulse to try and over automate.                                                                       |
| 07:42      | And the thing that I think he said, the thing he said that I think is very wise is you need                   |
| 07:47      | to trust the decisions you're making.                                                                         |
| 07:50      | You need to trust that you're making good decisions.                                                          |
| 07:52      | And so in the example of something like email, do you trust that robot to make the right decisions            |
| 07:58      | for you?                                                                                                      |
| 07:59      | If you use something like SaneBox, which can be a really great app for taking care of                         |
| 08:03      | nuisance email and trying to have them in the compensatory muscles saying, well, we're                        |
| 08:07      | going to give you a digest so you don't miss anything.                                                        |
| 08:10      | But it's still ultimately, do you trust like not looking at that email teaspoon by teaspoon?                  |
| 08:15      | How much can you automate?                                                                                    |
| 08:17      | We get rid of the junk?                                                                                       |
| 08:18      | Sure.                                                                                                         |
| 08:19      | But the problem's not junk.                                                                                   |
| 08:20      | It's the continuum.                                                                                           |
| 08:21      | And that part, middle part of the curve of the stuff that's neither fission or foul,                          |
| 08:26      | that you need to sit there and then figure out what do I need to do.                                          |
| 08:29      | So I do think there is a balance to be struck.                                                                |
| 08:32      | But any kind of stuff related to what we used to call life hacks, it begins with listening                    |
| 08:37      | for an impulse or intuition that there's something here where there's an improvement                          |
| 08:40      | opportunity.                                                                                                  |
| 08:41      | And then how do I decide what the improvement opportunity is?                                                 |
| 08:44      | How do I, through some kind of iteration, how do I improve this?                                              |
| 08:48      | But how do I also know when I'm going too far with that?                                                      |
| 08:51      | And I think with home automation, in particular, it becomes very obvious when you've gone                     |
| 08:55      | too far.                                                                                                      |
| 08:56      | When your family feels like they have to talk to a lamp in the right tone, with the right                     |
| 09:00      | hailing word, and you've created this bespoke hell of your own design.                                        |
| 09:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 09:07      | I'm laughing because I got woken up at three o'clock in the morning by my lights the other                    |
| 09:10      | day because I broke an automation.                                                                            |
| 09:11      | Oh, I accidentally streamed some very loud rock music to every HomePod in the house                          |
| 09:16      | this morning.                                                                                                 |
| 09:17      | And I get the same, it's going to all the speakers.                                                           |
| 09:20      | I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear some power pop.                                         |
| 09:23      | And now I woke everybody up because I forgot that they're not paired, they're ganged together                 |
| 09:29      | in that sort of ungainly interface on my phone for saying which speakers I want to send                       |
| 09:36      | to.                                                                                                           |
| 09:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 09:38      | When you live with other people and have multiple HomePods, that is a recipe.                                |
| 09:42      | You are going to get in trouble at some point that there's just no way out.                                   |
| 09:46      | Well, it's so interesting.                                                                                    |
| 09:47      | I mean, we won't have time to get into all of these kinds of things, but it continues                         |
| 09:51      | to be so interesting to me which things each of these vendors or platforms is good for                        |
| 09:57      | and good at.                                                                                                  |
| 09:59      | And as I sit here in the year of our Lord 2020, November 24th, I'm sitting here and                           |
| 10:03      | it's still astonishing to me that my Series 6 watch, it takes about five times as long                        |
| 10:13      | for Siri on my watch to get and do what I'm saying on very fast Wi-Fi.                                        |
| 10:19      | It's about five times slower than I want to say the Amazon lady in the tube.                                  |
| 10:23      | If I say the lady in the tube, set a 21 minute pasta timer, well, that would be a really                      |
| 10:27      | bad pasta, set a 10 minute pasta timer.                                                                       |
| 10:30      | It's like, bang, the words are barely out of my mouth and it's done.                                          |
| 10:33      | But then for speakers, it's great.                                                                            |
| 10:34      | I can say, hey, dingus, play the latest episode of this such thing as a fish upstairs.                        |
| 10:40      | And it knows to just play it on all the speakers.                                                             |
| 10:42      | It won't sound as good.                                                                                       |
| 10:44      | So there's all these trade-offs right now.                                                                    |
| 10:45      | It's still, in some ways, it feels more like the Wild West than ever right now.                               |
| 10:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 10:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 10:51      | Yeah, I get what you mean.                                                                                    |
| 10:52      | And also some of these smart technologies are better at understanding the importance                          |
| 10:57      | of what you're saying.                                                                                        |
| 10:58      | So I had to try and set a 20 second timer when I was setting up my IKEA smart blinds.                         |
| 11:03      | And guess what?                                                                                               |
| 11:04      | It took my watch 10 seconds to figure out what I meant.                                                       |
| 11:07      | So I had a 30 second timer because the first 10 seconds were it going, I think I know what                    |
| 11:14      | you mean.                                                                                                     |
| 11:15      | Wait, do I know what you mean?                                                                                |
| 11:16      | Maybe I know what you mean.                                                                                   |
| 11:17      | Oh, wait.                                                                                                     |
| 11:18      | Yeah, I figured out what you mean.                                                                            |
| 11:19      | I've set a 20 second timer, only 10 seconds had already elapsed by the time it got to                         |
| 11:22      | this point.                                                                                                   |
| 11:23      | It's maddening though, because one of my most common, so I've done a little bit of nerdy,                     |
| 11:30      | very hacky stuff, because it turns out though, because the Amazon lady in a tube, that family                 |
| 11:35      | of products is faster and more able than the Apple family, at least for now.                                  |
| 11:41      | You know what I end up doing?                                                                                 |
| 11:42      | I end up saying that thing into the Amazon product.                                                           |
| 11:47      | And I will say something like, oh gosh, now you're going to make me think, add by flower                      |
| 11:53      | to my shopping list or, you know, doesn't search.                                                             |
| 11:56      | And then I've created, I've repurposed somebody else's automator script for grabbing multiple                 |
| 12:01      | reminders out of the reminders app.                                                                           |
| 12:04      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                      |
| 12:05      | I have those, I have TTT to send that to my reminders.                                                        |
| 12:09      | At the point when I now have an automation for copying reminders out of the reminders                         |
| 12:14      | app so I can put them in a Taskpaper, that's a bridge too far, right?                                        |
| 12:19      | It would be so much easier, but I say to my watch, for example, and I'm sorry, I'm always                     |
| 12:23      | bitching about this stuff, I say, remind me, remind me to check the bathroom lights when                      |
| 12:31      | I arrive at the office in 20 minutes.                                                                         |
| 12:33      | Now, I think this is, in some ways, very brilliant.                                                           |
| 12:35      | I love the idea that it will, whichever of those happens first, if I arrive at the office,                    |
| 12:41      | it'll give me the reminder.                                                                                   |
| 12:43      | If it's 20 minutes and I haven't arrived at the office, I'll also get that reminder.                          |
| 12:47      | That's great.                                                                                                 |
| 12:48      | You know what I get?                                                                                          |
| 12:49      | Because I do, because I'm a weirdo and have an English lady as my voice, my watch says                        |
| 12:53      | something like, I'm checking with the app.                                                                    |
| 12:55      | I'm like, you're what?                                                                                        |
| 12:56      | You're checking with the app?                                                                                 |
| 12:58      | And it just, it seems very, it seems very lazy.                                                               |
| 13:01      | It seems like somebody that got hired is some kind of like, I don't know, government work                     |
| 13:04      | program and doesn't really have their heart in it.                                                            |
| 13:08      | I don't know.                                                                                                 |
| 13:09      | I don't know why that is.                                                                                     |
| 13:10      | I used to be so good at typing on my iPhone and now I'm terrible at typing on my iPhone.                      |
| 13:14      | Is that all me?                                                                                               |
| 13:15      | I don't know.                                                                                                 |
| 13:16      | Siri sucked and then Siri got better and now I don't, now we're back to, I don't even                         |
| 13:20      | know.                                                                                                         |
| 13:21      | It's so unreliable.                                                                                           |
| 13:22      | And, you know, and you get to something though, like home security and I, you know, that really               |
| 13:27      | is maybe the corner case.                                                                                     |
| 13:28      | That's the extreme case.                                                                                      |
| 13:29      | But like, I don't want to cause problems where the police end up in my house because there                    |
| 13:35      | was some ambiguity or confusion about what I'm trying to do.                                                  |
| 13:39      | You know, I don't want to find out that my ring alarm did not arm until, you know, I've                       |
| 13:45      | gotten home.                                                                                                  |
| 13:46      | So, you know, there's all kinds of things were like the minute I leave the office, I                          |
| 13:49      | got notifications popping up all over the place.                                                              |
| 13:52      | Just informed your wife, you've left, you've got this, it's armed, it's in standby mode.                      |
| 13:55      | It's like all the stuff in there and you have the beep, beep, beep, beep, beep for like five                  |
| 13:59      | minutes.                                                                                                      |
| 14:00      | It's crazy making.                                                                                            |
| 14:01      | It's fine.                                                                                                    |
| 14:02      | We're recording episode 64 of the automators and I don't think we've spent this much time                     |
| 14:06      | talking about Siri in terms of the, you know, talk to the, the device as an automation                        |
| 14:13      | tool the whole time because it isn't something really very reliable.                                          |
| 14:17      | So I don't think a lot of us use it in that regard.                                                           |
| 14:21      | And also again, it's this confusion of like, what do we mean?                                                 |
| 14:23      | Like as Raymond Carver might say, what are we talking about when we talk about Siri?                          |
| 14:28      | Because as everybody kind of knows, Siri is, is, is, is, so let's talk about some things                      |
| 14:34      | here.                                                                                                         |
| 14:35      | What about like voice recognition or what's it called dictation?                                              |
| 14:38      | Is dictation Siri?                                                                                            |
| 14:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 14:40      | Kind of is asking what time it is, Siri.                                                                      |
| 14:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 14:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 14:44      | What about the thing that I love in iOS 14?                                                                   |
| 14:47      | What about the thing where it can intuit what app I'm going to want to use right now?                         |
| 14:52      | Well, yeah, that's Siri too.                                                                                  |
| 14:53      | I mean, that's a lot of different things to call Siri.                                                        |
| 14:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 14:57      | I think that, I imagine that's somewhat confusing for people.                                                 |
| 14:59      | It's very Apple though.                                                                                       |
| 15:00      | They take one, you know, iCloud, Siri, there's a bunch of words that mean a lot of things                     |
| 15:04      | coming out of Apple.                                                                                          |
| 15:05      | Oh, you mean like Apple TV where I can watch Apple TV plus on the [[Apple TV app]] of my Apple                    |
| 15:09      | TV?                                                                                                           |
| 15:10      | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 15:11      | Exactly like that.                                                                                            |
| 15:12      | And that's why, because Siri suggestions are great.                                                           |
| 15:16      | And I, I do believe that, you know, somewhere underneath it's all related to the same code                    |
| 15:21      | base, but at the same time, there can be so many different things that they're theoretically                  |
| 15:26      | attached to the same code base, but in reality have very little to do with each other.                        |
| 15:30      | So without actually looking at the details here, you know, I can't tell you if Siri                           |
| 15:34      | suggestions really use the exact same stuff that the Siri, the voice assistant uses.                          |
| 15:39      | But I can say that if I swipe down on [[Spotlight]] at the moment, the eight Siri suggestions                     |
| 15:43      | that are there are bang on for this time of day.                                                              |
| 15:46      | Exactly.                                                                                                      |
| 15:47      | But there's also the thing, the Madness.                                                                      |
| 15:48      | One of the pieces of Madness for me is, you know, there's also the thing where Siri can                       |
| 15:53      | give you suggestions, I hope we'll talk about Siri suggestions for the apps because it's                      |
| 15:58      | just brilliant.                                                                                               |
| 15:59      | But the other one is like an announced feature that I do know exists is, hey, it looks like                   |
| 16:06      | you, you know, stuff like, oh, your watch is charged.                                                         |
| 16:09      | I love that.                                                                                                  |
| 16:10      | But also stuff like, you know, it looks like you've got a meeting in five minutes.                            |
| 16:13      | Do you want to turn on, do not disturb.                                                                       |
| 16:15      | I can count on one hand the number of times that I've gotten that.                                            |
| 16:20      | And I've gone into the insane interface and I've radio buttoned every single thing.                           |
| 16:24      | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 16:25      | Learn from Siri.                                                                                              |
| 16:26      | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 16:27      | Give me suggestions.                                                                                          |
| 16:28      | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 16:29      | All the things I don't know.                                                                                  |
| 16:30      | I feel like Fonzie.                                                                                           |
| 16:31      | I don't know what part of the jukebox to hit to have this always give me the DND thing.                       |
| 16:35      | I don't know how it decides and I don't know how to motivate it to give me lots more of                       |
| 16:39      | this and lots less of that.                                                                                   |
| 16:42      | You know?                                                                                                     |
| 16:43      | And then also you end up doing things like depending on apps, like for example, with                          |
| 16:47      | my Arlo cameras, there are times where I do, somebody is doing something in the garage                        |
| 16:51      | and I don't want constant notifications.                                                                      |
| 16:53      | You can snooze that, you can snooze it for an hour, you can snooze it for 24 hours.                           |
| 16:57      | But that's part of the app.                                                                                   |
| 16:59      | That is not part of, of the Apple product.                                                                    |
| 17:03      | And so there are times where I'm just like, you know, this entire kind of notification,                       |
| 17:07      | I wish to be, you could deliver quietly, you could turn off, I wish I got up and there's                      |
| 17:12      | probably a shortcut where I could do this, but I would love a pop-up that says, don't                         |
| 17:15      | give me this kind of notification for this long.                                                              |
| 17:19      | But again, now what happens when you're using, for example, the Logitech Circle View Camera,                  |
| 17:24      | Logitech Circle View Camera, good camera, real good, made for HomeKit.                                        |
| 17:28      | What does that mean?                                                                                          |
| 17:29      | It does not have an app.                                                                                      |
| 17:30      | The only way to interact with that camera is in HomeKit full stop.                                            |
| 17:34      | If you get your VPN on, guess what?                                                                           |
| 17:37      | You can't see the camera because some things on HomeKit will not work.                                        |
| 17:40      | If you've ever had trouble configuring something locally, like a new device, it can be because                |
| 17:45      | you've got a VPN on and it can't do the stuff that it needs to do.                                            |
| 17:49      | Anyway, it's not a very piecemeal and I think really so much of when we talk about automation,                |
| 17:53      | what we're doing, how we do it, it comes down to how do you develop the existential                           |
| 17:58      | spackle to make all of the stuff work together in a way that improves your life rather than                   |
| 18:03      | makes it into a complicated and confusing drag?                                                               |
| 18:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 18:07      | That's the puzzle we are all trying to solve here because that's what we want with automation.                |
| 18:11      | We do want it to make life easier and sometimes it does feel like technology is making our                    |
| 18:15      | life harder.                                                                                                  |
| 18:16      | In my experience, the do not disturb thing always shows up for meetings that I don't                          |
| 18:20      | really care about because they're work meetings.                                                              |
| 18:22      | So if my work phone goes off during a work meeting, then guess what?                                          |
| 18:25      | I'm going to get up and answer it.                                                                            |
| 18:26      | That's fine.                                                                                                  |
| 18:28      | And that's part of my job description.                                                                        |
| 18:29      | I'm expected to do that.                                                                                      |
| 18:31      | But during a podcast, if my phone goes off, then well, I don't want my phone going off                        |
| 18:35      | in the first place, which is why my phone goes into do not disturb thanks to an NFC                           |
| 18:39      | tag on my desk, which is an automation that I've put into place because I need that to                        |
| 18:45      | just happen without me thinking about it.                                                                     |
| 18:47      | And so I tap the NFC tag and it does this stuff.                                                              |
| 18:49      | So I've kind of worked around that.                                                                           |
| 18:52      | [[Matthew Cassinelli]] also has one that's cool.                                                                  |
| 18:55      | I think it broke a little bit and I think he fixed it, but he's got a real good shortcut                      |
| 18:58      | that I have on my watch.                                                                                      |
| 18:59      | I haven't used it in a while because it was, like I say, it was being a little bit hinky.                     |
| 19:03      | But you hit it and you get a pop-up and you select how long you want it to DND for.                           |
| 19:08      | And it's really intuitive.                                                                                    |
| 19:09      | I love stuff like that.                                                                                       |
| 19:11      | I do, there's so many things where I wish, I'm grateful that it exists, but as with                           |
| 19:15      | so many things in life, in technology, with Apple, the more you use it, the more you realise                  |
| 19:20      | what the limitations are and you're so like hungry for a certain kind of thing.                               |
| 19:25      | That pop-up that says that my watch is charged, how long has the Apple Watch been out?                        |
| 19:29      | How long has it been something that is until very recently, very much tied to an iPhone?                      |
| 19:34      | And it wasn't until 2020 that we got a pop-up that says your watch is charged.                                |
| 19:37      | Guess what I did?                                                                                             |
| 19:38      | I created a shortcut.                                                                                         |
| 19:39      | I created a shortcut so I could say, hey, dingus, charge my watch.                                            |
| 19:43      | And all it would do is in 70 minutes send me a reminder that my watch was probably done                       |
| 19:49      | charging.                                                                                                     |
| 19:50      | But what if it was on the stand wrong?                                                                        |
| 19:51      | Would I know that?                                                                                            |
| 19:52      | No.                                                                                                           |
| 19:53      | Like it's just, I don't know.                                                                                 |
| 19:54      | There's so much that you can see once you use this stuff a lot, you see the limitations                       |
| 19:59      | and the opportunities.                                                                                        |
| 20:00      | And then I think sometimes that motivates us to try harder to like fill in those gaps                         |
| 20:04      | ourselves.                                                                                                    |
| 20:05      | Well, you know, you talk about the last mile and the do not disturb one is a great example                    |
| 20:10      | because we can brute force our way around it.                                                                 |
| 20:13      | We can write a shortcut that maybe it's tied to the word meeting in an appointment whenever                   |
| 20:19      | you have an appointment as a word meeting in it.                                                              |
| 20:22      | Like the way that Google Calendar tries to guess what kind of graphic to give you based                       |
| 20:26      | on like lunch or picnic or whatever.                                                                          |
| 20:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 20:29      | But at the same time, Apple gets on stage once a year and says that, you know, we have                        |
| 20:33      | a neural engine that can run one trillion operations per second or some crazy number.                         |
| 20:39      | And all we really want is when we go in a meeting for the thing to be smart enough to                         |
| 20:43      | go into do not disturb without us having to write an automation for it.                                       |
| 20:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 20:48      | Like why don't you need to be cute about this?                                                                |
| 20:49      | It's just that if there is a business, a business goal, if you like, I don't know what                        |
| 20:54      | you call it, you know, there's a thing that I want to do.                                                     |
| 20:57      | And you know, the thought that goes through my mind, it's not particularly useful, but                        |
| 21:00      | the thought that goes through my mind is like, I know a little bit about this stuff.                          |
| 21:04      | I know enough to be dangerous, but like for somebody who saw one of those presentations                       |
| 21:09      | and then tried to put it in place, I mean, just setting up an Apple TV could be, can                          |
| 21:15      | be kind of crazy.                                                                                             |
| 21:16      | You know, like you go to your relative's house and they'll have motion smoothing turned                       |
| 21:19      | on because they've never learned that motion smoothing is a thing.                                            |
| 21:22      | Not a huge deal.                                                                                              |
| 21:23      | But there's all kinds of stuff from like, wow, I'm like, I would consider myself as we                        |
| 21:26      | say a power user, I'm not like a super nerd, I'm not like a programmer, but I know enough                     |
| 21:30      | to be aware of what I can accomplish, even if I don't know how to do it right now.                            |
| 21:35      | And I feel like there is a lot of stuff where like you're kind of in between, it's not that                   |
| 21:39      | easy to use and it's not that powerful with some of this stuff.                                               |
| 21:43      | And then I, again, I feel like that motivation is like, how do I make this easier to use?                     |
| 21:47      | How do I make this more powerful?                                                                             |
| 21:48      | How do I make it so my family doesn't have to talk to a lamp?                                                 |

| 22:04      | What's the point of creating all these automations to deal with the tedious tasks in your life                |
| 22:09      | if you don't have instant access to those automations at the tip of your fingers?                             |

| 22:48      | I use my Mac every day and I've tried a lot of different ways to launch scripts and there                     |
| 22:52      | is nothing faster than Fast Scripts.                                                                          |
| 22:55      | I love the way you can use keyboard shortcuts to get everything going.                                        |
| 22:59      | In fact, after a while, you don't even remember what the keyboard shortcuts are, your fingers                 |
| 23:03      | just push some buttons and magic starts happening on your Mac.                                                |
| 23:06      | And that's all because of Fast Scripts.                                                                       |

| 23:29      | Hey, let's talk a little bit about shortcuts because we were mentioning it earlier.                           |
| 23:35      | Are you using shortcuts these days and what are the things that you're doing with it?                         |
| 23:40      | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                             |
| 23:41      | The analogy that comes straight to mind is there's cooking from scratch, gourmet cooking                      |
| 23:50      | from scratch because you're a chef and you know how to make food.                                             |
| 23:55      | There's ordering out, there's blue apron, there's freshly, freshly the service that                           |
| 24:01      | basically brings you expensive leftovers.                                                                     |
| 24:03      | But depending, they all involve eating, but they all take another, there's like different                     |
| 24:07      | levels of expertise to that.                                                                                  |
| 24:09      | I say that because I get a lot more out of shortcuts other people have made.                                  |
| 24:16      | I can kind of whack around and make my own, but yeah, I do use shortcuts.                                     |
| 24:21      | I do like shortcuts, but I mostly just benefit from what other people have made.                              |
| 24:28      | Things like I say, like [[Matthew Cassinelli]] stuff that [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] has put out, all that                          |
| 24:33      | kind of stuff where I use it.                                                                                 |
| 24:35      | I don't really know how it's working sometimes, but I really like it a lot and I like shortcuts               |
| 24:41      | as a bridge from something like HomeKit, which can be so dumb sometimes.                                      |
| 24:46      | A bridge to like, I just need a little bit more than this one bit automation and if that's                    |
| 24:52      | easy enough to do in shortcuts.                                                                               |
| 24:53      | I love the shortcuts exist, I love using it and I'm very excited about the future.                            |
| 24:57      | I would agree with that.                                                                                      |
| 24:59      | The HomeKit stuff, I think, really is an area that everybody could benefit from using                         |
| 25:04      | shortcuts because you're exactly right.                                                                       |
| 25:06      | I mean, HomeKit only goes so far and if there's particular lights or sensors or things you                    |
| 25:12      | want to combine into something, writing your own shortcut script for it really isn't that                     |
| 25:18      | hard and it's a great way to kind of improve what you're getting out of it.                                   |
| 25:24      | What are some examples of ways you're using it for HomeKit?                                                   |
| 25:29      | HomeKit is a real mixed bag for me.                                                                           |
| 25:32      | When I first started getting into this stuff, the two platforms that I kind of got most                       |
| 25:38      | invested in were Philips Hue lights and the Amazon voice products because they're both                        |
| 25:45      | real reliable, they're real good.                                                                             |
| 25:47      | We rent, so we're not going to be able to rewire our whole house and Hue's been pretty                        |
| 25:52      | good for that along the way things have improved.                                                             |
| 25:55      | There's lots more devices now that can play well and so HomeKit has always in some ways                       |
| 25:59      | been a little bit of a cord of last resort for me and I want it to be great but it also                       |
| 26:06      | can be maddening sometimes.                                                                                   |
| 26:09      | I like the way that it suggests automations for you now but as I say, some of those automations               |
| 26:13      | are pretty brain dead and a lot of them assume levels of engagement that are difficult.                       |
| 26:20      | There's so many automations out of the box in HomeKit that are based on is everybody                          |
| 26:24      | home?                                                                                                         |
| 26:25      | Is everybody away?                                                                                            |
| 26:26      | I can't get my family to sign up for these things.                                                            |
| 26:28      | I keep inviting my wife to things, she doesn't get the invitation so I can't utilise those.                   |
| 26:32      | I got to hack together a lot on my own and sometimes it works flawlessly, sometimes it                        |
| 26:36      | doesn't.                                                                                                      |
| 26:37      | So I wanted, for example, I want to have a Hue, I continue to believe that sensors of                         |
| 26:43      | different kinds are going to be the piece that makes a lot of this stuff powerful.                            |
| 26:49      | Geolocation is an interesting idea.                                                                           |
| 26:51      | Geolocation is useful for OmniFocus, right?                                                                   |
| 26:54      | Oh, you're near a drugstore, do this thing, brilliant.                                                        |
| 26:58      | But at your house, until we get the ultra-wideband and get those little tile style dinguses,                  |
| 27:05      | it's still such a blunt instrument and I feel like sensors are the missing piece and there's                  |
| 27:09      | not that many sensors that are good and work with HomeKit.                                                    |
| 27:14      | This is a problem that will come up again and again.                                                          |
| 27:16      | So Philips Hue sensors are pretty good and they work with HomeKit so I end up using those                     |
| 27:21      | a lot.                                                                                                        |
| 27:22      | Here's what I wanted.                                                                                         |
| 27:23      | You go into the bathroom after a certain hour, it turns on the light dimly, turns it off                      |
| 27:26      | after a while.                                                                                                |
| 27:27      | It's an incredibly straightforward thing you need and I'm sure somebody who's a developer                     |
| 27:31      | could make that.                                                                                              |
| 27:32      | When I made it, I ran into like three different problems.                                                     |
| 27:34      | Well, what happens if somebody turned the light on after they go in because they want                         |
| 27:37      | a brighter light?                                                                                             |
| 27:38      | Well, now when it detects your motion, it's going to turn that light way down, which is                       |
| 27:42      | not what they wanted.                                                                                         |
| 27:43      | If you have one of those in your closet, what's the line on?                                                  |
| 27:45      | Well, what if you want to spend more than five minutes in the closet?                                         |
| 27:48      | How do you, I know there's ways to address all of these things but HomeKit gives you                          |
| 27:52      | the very basic sort of things of like, if your goal is like, when I leave the house,                          |
| 27:56      | lock the door.                                                                                                |
| 27:57      | Like that'll mostly work.                                                                                     |
| 27:58      | Geolocation is not very reliable.                                                                             |
| 28:02      | As somebody who has an office near his house, there's just myriad things where things are                     |
| 28:08      | stepping on other things.                                                                                     |
| 28:10      | This is not even getting into, you know what?                                                                 |
| 28:13      | Last week, my front porch light started shutting off around sunset and I didn't even know where               |
| 28:21      | to begin.                                                                                                     |
| 28:22      | Well, I knew where to begin, which is like, go to HomeKit and see if I accidentally did                       |
| 28:24      | something.                                                                                                    |
| 28:25      | Then I got to go to all these different apps.                                                                 |
| 28:27      | All these different apps have all these, there could be somewhere in there where something                    |
| 28:31      | got flipped the wrong way.                                                                                    |
| 28:33      | Maybe I picked a group instead of a room.                                                                     |
| 28:35      | You know what I'm talking about?                                                                              |
| 28:36      | Have you had these experiences where like, you cannot, and there's no log.                                    |
| 28:39      | There's no log.                                                                                               |
| 28:40      | There's no notifications.                                                                                     |
| 28:41      | There's certain kinds of things where you can get notifications like some motion detectors,                   |
| 28:45      | but I had no way to find out what is causing this.                                                            |
| 28:50      | And I had to assume there was probably something unintentionally, some dumb thing I did unintentionally.      |
| 28:55      | I finally did figure it out.                                                                                  |
| 28:58      | And when I say figure it out, I kept trying things until it got fixed.                                        |
| 29:02      | Basically the way that I would develop PHP, which is like, when the page loads, I guess                       |
| 29:05      | I'm done.                                                                                                     |
| 29:06      | When it loads without an error, I guess I fixed it, but if you don't know what, if you have                   |
| 29:12      | a problem and it gets fixed and you don't know how you fixed it, it's really only a                           |
| 29:16      | half solve problem.                                                                                           |
| 29:18      | You've gotten rid of the symptoms and the annoyance, but if you don't understand what                         |
| 29:23      | was causing the problem you nominally solved, you're not that much better off.                                |
| 29:27      | Yeah, I totally get that.                                                                                     |
| 29:29      | And especially the home app doesn't allow you to do all of the automation options that                        |
| 29:34      | HomeKit does, which feels like a massive oversight.                                                           |
| 29:37      | Though fortunately it's opened the door for a lot of other apps like Home Plus.                               |
| 29:41      | So my solution to this particular problem.                                                                    |
| 29:43      | So glad you brought up Home Plus.                                                                             |
| 29:44      | That's exactly, Home Plus is the skeleton key.                                                                |
| 29:47      | There's so much you can do in there, it exposes so much more information about every device.                  |
| 29:52      | So for example, with your bathroom light option, with Home Plus, you can say, if I detect                     |
| 29:57      | motion and the bathroom light isn't on, then turn on the bathroom light dimly.                                |
| 30:03      | But you can't do that in the home app.                                                                        |
| 30:04      | And that feels like a maddening oversight.                                                                    |
| 30:07      | But at the same time, I also understand that Apple want to keep this stuff relatively simple.                 |
| 30:12      | So the way that I am taking the Keep It Silly Simple approach is I use the Hue app and the                    |
| 30:20      | IKEA app to add the items to HomeKit.                                                                         |
| 30:23      | And that is where my usage of the Hue app, the IKEA app, the Aqara app almost ends.                          |
| 30:29      | The Aqara app, I've got two buttons working as doorbells and the way that they talk to                       |
| 30:33      | their hub to make a ding-dong sound is best done through their app.                                           |
| 30:37      | But that is the sole exception that I have made to this particular rule.                                      |
| 30:41      | Because otherwise, you do have to...                                                                          |
| 30:42      | Every app is different.                                                                                       |
| 30:43      | Every device is different.                                                                                    |
| 30:45      | I want notifications for certain kinds of things that Home and HomeKit do not offer.                          |
| 30:50      | I can only get those notifications through a third-party app.                                                 |
| 30:54      | And I sent a friend recently screenshots of my daughter's room in like six different                          |
| 30:59      | apps.                                                                                                         |
| 31:00      | It's incredible.                                                                                              |
| 31:01      | It's just wild how different they all are.                                                                    |
| 31:03      | But yeah, I'd gone away from Home Plus for a while, but recently came back to it.                             |
| 31:07      | And I guess I didn't realise how much is in there, there's so much good stuff in there.                       |
| 31:11      | Yeah, there really is.                                                                                        |
| 31:12      | But I do think the hardware problem with HomeKit is one that Apple...                                         |
| 31:17      | I really just don't understand why they didn't solve it, why Apple doesn't make their own                     |
| 31:20      | hardware.                                                                                                     |
| 31:21      | I mean, here's a company that likes to charge money for stuff that you bring home and plug                    |
| 31:28      | into your wall.                                                                                               |
| 31:30      | And so much of these problems to me sourced back to third-party hardware.                                     |
| 31:34      | We just got a... we started setting up our Christmas decorations while I bought off Amazon                    |
| 31:39      | from a third-party, some of these HomeKit-enabled plugs, you know, you plug them in the wall                  |
| 31:44      | and they say they work with HomeKit great.                                                                    |
| 31:46      | It's got the little funny little QR code thing on top of it that you scan with the HomeKit                    |
| 31:51      | app.                                                                                                          |
| 31:52      | And my whole idea was I want to use these things, but I don't want to install another                         |
| 31:56      | app and I want to deal with it, you know.                                                                     |
| 31:59      | And it worked.                                                                                                |
| 32:00      | You know, I plugged it in, I scanned the code, HomeKit recognised it, it turns the lights                     |
| 32:04      | off, it turns them on.                                                                                        |
| 32:05      | But then it's got this little alert on it saying this hardware, you know, there's a firmware                  |
| 32:11      | update for this hardware.                                                                                     |
| 32:13      | So I said, okay, well, let's run the firmware update.                                                         |
| 32:17      | Well, to do that...                                                                                           |
| 32:18      | Which you have to do in a different app, yeah.                                                                |
| 32:20      | So I'm like, ugh.                                                                                             |
| 32:22      | But also, David, it's worth mentioning you also have to read all of the tiny text.                            |
| 32:27      | And the tiny text will tell you, oh, by the way, there's an update available for this.                        |
| 32:31      | You have to do that in a different app.                                                                       |
| 32:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 32:34      | And it reads the blah, blah text, but that's really important.                                                |
| 32:37      | This all happened like 12 hours ago.                                                                          |
| 32:40      | Install the app.                                                                                              |
| 32:41      | I'm like, okay, do the firmware update and then it hangs up and it doesn't do the firmware                    |
| 32:46      | update.                                                                                                       |
| 32:47      | The third party app is garbage.                                                                               |
| 32:48      | I paid $15 for this plug.                                                                                     |
| 32:51      | You know, I just want one little small Christmas tree to turn off and on, you know.                           |
| 32:57      | And so I give up on the app.                                                                                  |
| 32:59      | I go back to HomeKit and now it's no longer working in HomeKit either.                                        |
| 33:03      | So whatever I did, completely screwed up the whole thing.                                                     |
| 33:05      | I had to basically reset the whole device.                                                                    |
| 33:08      | But sometimes, like I set up, I tried to set up HOOBS.                                                        |
| 33:10      | I tried to set up HOOBS, the home automation out of the box thing and, oh my God, I thought                   |
| 33:15      | it would...                                                                                                   |
| 33:16      | I even bought the Rain Man Suite.                                                                             |
| 33:17      | Like I got the fancy one that was already just like plug and play and I could not make                        |
| 33:21      | heads and tails of it.                                                                                        |
| 33:22      | The entire thing, it felt like I was using some kind of a GUI for Emacs.                                      |
| 33:26      | It was so confusing to me what I was meant to supposed to be doing.                                           |
| 33:29      | And then I had devices show up in the home that I couldn't delete.                                            |
| 33:32      | I didn't...                                                                                                   |
| 33:33      | I'm sorry, I'm just bitching at this point.                                                                   |
| 33:35      | But there is something that's supremely frustrating about when this moves in the wrong direction.             |
| 33:43      | So for example, at my office, I decided years ago when I started doing...                                     |
| 33:48      | I would have the Amazon family of products, but I would use Belkin's Wemo family of products                  |
| 33:54      | for sensors and lights.                                                                                       |
| 33:56      | So basically, I got a bunch of these plugs for my plugs and I didn't want to do things                        |
| 34:02      | with colours and brightness.                                                                                   |
| 34:03      | I just wanted a way that like when I come in, I want it to see that I'm here and turn                         |
| 34:07      | on the lights.                                                                                                |
| 34:08      | Long story short, I don't know what's going on with Belkin and Wemo.                                          |
| 34:11      | I think their back is not in it anymore.                                                                      |
| 34:14      | They've been very unreliable for a long time.                                                                 |
| 34:17      | Such that when I speak to any voice device, it's pretty much a crap shoot whether it will                     |
| 34:21      | get what I said.                                                                                              |
| 34:22      | So you know what I did?                                                                                       |
| 34:23      | I bought their bridge, their home kit bridge.                                                                 |
| 34:26      | You buy this device, you plug it into the ethernet, you plug it into the power and you                        |
| 34:31      | say from now on Hakuna Matata, run everything through the bridge and guess what?                              |
| 34:35      | Home kit will work great now.                                                                                 |
| 34:37      | Well, number two, sometimes it just lights don't go on or off.                                                |
| 34:41      | It just whatever doesn't work.                                                                                |
| 34:42      | But you know why that is?                                                                                     |
| 34:44      | Because some people say once a week, some people say once a day.                                              |
| 34:47      | I'm here to tell you throughout the day, multiple times per day, I pull up home kit and every                 |
| 34:52      | single Wemo device is quote unquote not responding or unavailable.                                            |
| 34:56      | It's because the bridge just drops the entire connection and has to be power cycled to get                    |
| 35:02      | it again.                                                                                                     |
| 35:03      | Now at the point where I'm pulling a plug out of a device and plugging it back in in                          |
| 35:08      | order to be in order to be able to say hey dingus lights off, something's breaking down                       |
| 35:14      | at that point.                                                                                                |
| 35:15      | So on the one hand, you know, the one of my no time for this today, but one of my concerns                    |
| 35:19      | with Apple is if you set aside the iPhone, it's difficult to know what is it they super                       |
| 35:24      | care about right now?                                                                                         |
| 35:25      | Like what is what is their heart really in?                                                                   |
| 35:28      | Is it Ted Lasso?                                                                                              |
| 35:29      | Is it Apple TV?                                                                                               |
| 35:30      | Like which thing is it?                                                                                       |
| 35:31      | I don't have an answer to that and I'm not trying to be coy.                                                  |
| 35:34      | But I do know that.                                                                                           |
| 35:35      | Yeah, the phones are great.                                                                                   |
| 35:36      | It's awesome.                                                                                                 |
| 35:37      | But like which what are the other things they care intensely about if they really care                        |
| 35:40      | about home kit, we'll show it like make make some make a good router like that has got                        |
| 35:45      | home kit built in like make good devices for these things make software that's really reliable                |
| 35:50      | or just let people like Belkin, you know, strap stuff onto your system and hope that                          |
| 35:55      | it works.                                                                                                     |
| 35:56      | But that most people are not going to blame Belkin for that they're going to blame Apple                      |
| 36:00      | for that.                                                                                                     |
| 36:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 36:02      | If that stuff doesn't work together.                                                                          |
| 36:03      | So I don't know what the answer is, but I do know that it's incredibly frustrating                            |
| 36:07      | to spend the time to get this stuff working the way you want.                                                 |
| 36:10      | And then guess what?                                                                                          |
| 36:11      | Something happened and you know what you got now six, eight, nine devices are now in something                |
| 36:16      | called default room.                                                                                          |
| 36:18      | What caused that to happen?                                                                                   |
| 36:19      | I don't I have no way of knowing, but three things from my daughter's room are now in                         |
| 36:23      | default room.                                                                                                 |
| 36:25      | You don't you ever get this?                                                                                  |
| 36:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 36:27      | Stuff just falls off into default room.                                                                       |
| 36:28      | Why?                                                                                                          |
| 36:29      | I have no idea why.                                                                                           |
| 36:30      | Well, in my case, it was because I was playing around with Homebridge and I recessed some                     |
| 36:34      | things and that was a bad idea.                                                                               |
| 36:35      | I changed the name of our hallway to hall.                                                                    |
| 36:39      | And then we had a room called hallway, depending on the app, because it wasn't all caught up,                 |
| 36:43      | I guess, and something got stepped on.                                                                        |
| 36:44      | I had hallway and I had hall and I had default room because it just barfed and decided like                   |
| 36:50      | it didn't know where things go.                                                                               |
| 36:51      | And I guess default room is precisely that when we don't know where to put it, it falls                       |
| 36:55      | off into this newly created thing with no photo called default room.                                          |
| 36:58      | And it's like, now guess what I got to do?                                                                    |
| 37:00      | Now my thumb gets a workout because I got to go through, I got a long press, I got a                          |
| 37:05      | drag, I got to do all the things, reset what's room, what room it's in.                                       |
| 37:08      | And by the way, in HomeKit, it's a good idea to name your devices starting with the name,                     |
| 37:13      | the exact name of the room.                                                                                   |
| 37:14      | So for example, I would say like lounge TV or Emma overhead light or whatever.                                |
| 37:20      | And that way that falls off in the room and you see just the thing.                                           |
| 37:24      | But that's so much work that just have the lights turn on.                                                    |
| 37:28      | But the bonus of naming all of your devices that way is then if you're in the room Emma,                      |
| 37:32      | then the word Emma at the start of the name disappears.                                                       |
| 37:35      | That's exactly what I'm saying.                                                                               |
| 37:36      | But it only works if you put it at the start of the name.                                                     |
| 37:37      | So if I put it at the later of the name, it doesn't work.                                                     |
| 37:38      | So if I put Emma somewhere that's not Emma, I know it's, well, I got a default room situation.                |
| 37:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 37:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 37:45      | And I found that that specifically recently happened to me because of the Hue app.                            |
| 37:49      | So I updated my Hue bridge because adaptive lighting has hit here in the UK and it turns                      |
| 37:54      | out none of my white light bulbs are compatible because they are white light bulbs.                           |
| 37:58      | Oh, you didn't get colour ambience or whatever.                                                                |
| 38:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 38:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 38:03      | I've not got any ambience bulbs.                                                                              |
| 38:04      | I've got a couple of ambience lights though.                                                                  |
| 38:05      | So I have ambient lighting in my office except for my overhead light right now.                               |
| 38:08      | But anyway, so that happened and it updated the bridge and then it said, oh, hey, your                        |
| 38:14      | home app is out of sync.                                                                                      |
| 38:15      | You're out of sync with Siri.                                                                                 |
| 38:17      | You got to update everything.                                                                                 |
| 38:19      | And then it just, my, three of my lights just randomly ended up in default room and I don't                   |
| 38:25      | know why those three lights, it was one of my two living room overhead lights, my bedroom                     |
| 38:30      | overhead light and my hallway overhead light, none of which are colour bulbs or ambience                       |
| 38:35      | bulbs or have anything to do with the update that was installed.                                              |
| 38:38      | None of them.                                                                                                 |
| 38:39      | But that's what happened.                                                                                     |
| 38:40      | So yeah, it's unfortunate, but I'm going to be looking at this, this hoops thing.                             |
| 38:44      | I've also heard good things about a styling hub, which will get a ring and some other                         |
| 38:48      | things into home kit, but I've not played with any of those because I'm doing quite                           |
| 38:54      | well personally with Homebridge.                                                                             |
| 38:57      | And most of my devices are fortunately home kit compatible.                                                   |
| 39:00      | So I can work around that with, except for the switch bot.                                                    |
| 39:03      | But that's really the problem, I think, is that like, you got to have three different                         |
| 39:07      | bridges and all these other apps to make this work.                                                           |
| 39:11      | I feel like, you know, Apple is a company that became, you know, made its bones by making                     |
| 39:16      | the whole widget, you know, and they still to this day brag about that, but for whatever                      |
| 39:20      | reason in home automation, they decided we'll give you kind of the brain, but you're going                    |
| 39:26      | to go to other parties to buy all the pieces.                                                                 |
| 39:29      | And that just doesn't work.                                                                                   |
| 39:31      | I mean, so on the one hand, where they have a lot of masters to serve, they have a lot                        |
| 39:37      | of implicit promises on a lot of things or a lot that we imagine they promised us, like                       |
| 39:41      | it just works, but also privacy, right?                                                                       |
| 39:43      | So I love the fact that they put privacy first to the extent that I can tell, but for a long                  |
| 39:48      | time that led to some huge limitations.                                                                       |
| 39:53      | You go into Amazon, ALEXA skills, or you know, you go into, you just say, you know, discover                  |
| 39:59      | my devices, you talk to your Google hub, all those things, there's so many integrations.                      |
| 40:04      | Now, not all of them are great, but they basically said, hey, this whole ecosystem is open, have              |
| 40:09      | fun with it.                                                                                                  |
| 40:10      | And Apple did not do that, and I think on the one hand, I understand why they did that                        |
| 40:14      | because they don't want security cameras on there that aren't secure, but I like that                         |
| 40:19      | they open that up more, but even that is still a little bit wild because I have some cameras                  |
| 40:24      | like that.                                                                                                    |
| 40:25      | Again, that Logitech, that is 100% like Apple's okey-dokey, but the Arlo cameras are only                     |
| 40:31      | partially supported, so you get some kinds of features, but not others.                                       |
| 40:34      | If you want to see face detection, you have to go drill down five levels in the home app,                     |
| 40:38      | which is not a ton of fun.                                                                                    |
| 40:40      | But you know, I'm glad that's opening up, but I don't know, it's just always so encouraging                   |
| 40:44      | to see them put their back into something, and then when they don't put their back into                       |
| 40:48      | something, they're not talking about it, and I think that's where the frustration comes                       |
| 40:51      | from, because you're talking about a multiple hundreds of dollars mistake if you get this                     |
| 41:16      | the right thing to say.                                                                                       |
| 41:35      | I use TextExpander all the time.                                                                              |
| 41:37      | It's great for sending off emails to, for example, the people who manage the building                         |
| 41:41      | that I live in to make sure that they have all the information that they need without                         |
| 41:45      | me having to copy and paste it from somewhere or use any other kind of automation.                            |
| 41:51      | TextExpander can be used on any platform, in any app, anywhere you type.                                      |

| 42:09      | Our thanks to TextExpander and Smell for their support of the show and Relay FM.                             |
| 42:14      | One thing that we should note, though, the Apple has made an improvement on is Thread,                        |
| 42:19      | which is a new feature that came with the HomePod Minis.                                                      |
| 42:23      | And I have a HomePod Minis sitting in my kitchen.                                                             |
| 42:25      | And this is apparently a really great way to speed up the connectivity with certain devices.                  |
| 42:29      | I have seen some great reports.                                                                               |
| 42:31      | Nanoleaf launched a couple of new devices recently, a light strip, a colour light bulb,                        |
| 42:37      | which are more affordable really than the Hue options because you don't need to buy a bridge.                 |
| 42:42      | And so if you just want one colour light bulb to try out some home kit stuff, then it's                        |
| 42:45      | quite an affordable way of doing it.                                                                          |
| 42:47      | And if you have a device that supports Thread, like say a HomePod Mini, apparently the connection             |
| 42:52      | speed is way faster.                                                                                          |
| 42:54      | I saw that on my Eero, but I saw an Eero that that's an option, but I've never learned                        |
| 42:58      | what that does.                                                                                               |
| 42:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 43:00      | So Thread is new.                                                                                             |
| 43:02      | Don't ask me exactly how it works.                                                                            |
| 43:03      | I will try and find one of the Apple technical support documents that we can throw in the                     |
| 43:08      | show notes so that people can actually learn about how this works instead of how I think                      |
| 43:12      | it works.                                                                                                     |
| 43:13      | But from what I've read on HomeKit forums and so on, it just basically speeds up your                         |
| 43:17      | connection to Bluetooth devices.                                                                              |
| 43:20      | And I do actually have two EVE energy plugs in my kitchen, which is next to my home, well,                    |
| 43:27      | my HomePod Mini is also in my kitchen, so.                                                                    |
| 43:29      | I had to get an EVE bridge for it to speak to.                                                                |
| 43:35      | So I'm so stupid.                                                                                             |
| 43:37      | Don't give me money.                                                                                          |
| 43:39      | I got really frustrated that the EVE devices, so I've got an EVE.                                             |
| 43:42      | They're fancy, like costly.                                                                                   |
| 43:43      | I think it's called the EVE room or something like that, whatever it's called.                                |
| 43:48      | It's not cheap and it does, it doesn't do sensors, but it doesn't do like motion, but                         |
| 43:54      | it does temperature, it does humidity and air quality, whatever that means.                                   |
| 44:00      | Air quality is an entire racket.                                                                              |
| 44:01      | I just don't really understand.                                                                               |
| 44:03      | But anyway, it does that and that's cool.                                                                     |
| 44:04      | But sometimes it is stuff I need to know, but have you gotten into this Rose?                                 |
| 44:10      | So like you got something and it's like tracking in the case of like I have an EVE sensor for                 |
| 44:15      | tracking motion.                                                                                              |
| 44:16      | I have these EVE things for temperature, humidity, air quality, but it won't update.                          |
| 44:22      | First of all, it doesn't update across devices.                                                               |
| 44:25      | It updates per device.                                                                                        |
| 44:27      | So if you haven't opened the EVE app, refreshed and waited, you might have realised you've                    |
| 44:32      | lost three weeks of data because it fell off, like because you didn't update it.                              |
| 44:37      | So you know what I did?                                                                                       |
| 44:38      | I bought the bridge.                                                                                          |
| 44:39      | I bought a bridge that says, hey, make sure we talk to all the EVEs, which is great because                   |
| 44:42      | now I can check it like from the, like if I'm at my office, I can see that, but you                           |
| 44:46      | know what?                                                                                                    |
| 44:47      | It still doesn't update.                                                                                      |
| 44:49      | It updates per device only when you, it's like trying to get on a plane and you forgot                        |
| 44:55      | to like update notes before you got on the plane or whatever or you know, it's just,                          |
| 45:00      | it's maddening to me.                                                                                         |
| 45:01      | But how, but EVE is otherwise so good, so much of their stuff is really, really well                          |
| 45:04      | done and polished, but like there's little things like that where it's like, am I the                         |
| 45:08      | only person that likes to quantify and record information?                                                    |
| 45:11      | Why am I such a weirdo?                                                                                       |
| 45:12      | Like I need a log on the one hand to tell me why my stupid light is turning on, but                           |
| 45:16      | I also want to be able to like send stuff to a spreadsheet.                                                   |
| 45:19      | I want, I want to be able to do that.                                                                         |
| 45:20      | I don't want to have to open up like a, a Zapier or whatever in order to like, you know,                      |
| 45:26      | create a third Rube Goldberg device for my other Rube Goldberg devices.                                       |
| 45:29      | That's crazy making.                                                                                          |
| 45:31      | Well, you have just solved the mystery that I have been struggling to solve, which is                         |
| 45:35      | why am I not, why do I have massive holes of six days of no data in the, the energy                           |
| 45:41      | consumption for my washing machine?                                                                           |
| 45:43      | And it's because I don't open the app.                                                                        |
| 45:45      | I thought because I was getting it using shortcuts on a regular basis that that would                         |
| 45:49      | do the trick.                                                                                                 |
| 45:50      | Right.                                                                                                        |
| 45:51      | Apparently that does not do it.                                                                               |
| 45:52      | So this explains many, many things.                                                                           |
| 45:55      | So thank you for that, Miller.                                                                                |
| 45:56      | That was very helpful.                                                                                        |
| 45:57      | Because you're letting, you know, part of the value, you're very welcome, part of the                         |
| 45:59      | value of that, if one chooses to, is to do comparisons.                                                       |
| 46:04      | Like one of the, one of the, I think marquee features is like, you know, and that's a big                     |
| 46:07      | deal here in, in stupid California with the smoke and the fires is like, give me a quantitative,              |
| 46:11      | like, give me this month versus that month.                                                                   |
| 46:16      | And like, if you, if you don't have that, or this just drops off and it's also just                           |
| 46:19      | so crazy to me that like the continues to be, you've lost the data on that device, right?                     |
| 46:25      | Other devices might have caught up.                                                                           |
| 46:27      | But like the fact that that lives on a device feels like something from 2004 feels like                       |
| 46:31      | I'm using a Chumby.                                                                                           |
| 46:32      | It's nuts.                                                                                                    |
| 46:33      | Sorry.                                                                                                        |
| 46:34      | Okay.                                                                                                         |
| 46:35      | Let's be positive.                                                                                            |
| 46:36      | Positive automation.                                                                                          |
| 46:37      | Well, let's have a look at some of these other things.                                                        |
| 46:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 46:41      | I think, you know, just kind of to put a cap, er on it, home kit, it's got some great things                    |
| 46:46      | like just being able to sit there and yell into the air, turn the Christmas tree lights                       |
| 46:50      | on and see them turn on is, is awesome.                                                                       |
| 46:53      | But they need help and honestly, I really think that Apple needs to make the hardware                         |
| 46:58      | because the, this whole ecosystem where you've got to go into these third party apps and                      |
| 47:03      | bounce back and forth, it's just not, it definitely is not historically what we would                         |
| 47:07      | think of as something from Apple.                                                                             |
| 47:09      | And it, it comes with all of the harrowing war stories that we've been sharing.                               |
| 47:13      | It does.                                                                                                      |
| 47:14      | And this is why yesterday when I was playing with a new nighttime routine, I accidentally                     |
| 47:19      | had an issue where my robot vacuum was briefly turning itself on and then coming out and                      |
| 47:27      | then going back and looking for a stalking station because I accidentally added the find                      |
| 47:31      | robot vacuum button to my scene.                                                                              |
| 47:33      | That is literally something out of Idiocracy.                                                                 |
| 47:35      | There's that scene in Idiocracy in the waiting room when the little Roomba just keeps going                   |
| 47:39      | back and forth and cleaning the same area over and over.                                                      |
| 47:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 47:44      | Well, there was, I remember seeing a story on social media a couple of months ago of                          |
| 47:48      | how somebody nearly ended up divorced because of a robot vacuum.                                              |
| 47:52      | Because his robot vacuum was plugged into a smart outlet.                                                     |
| 47:56      | And every time they went to bed, he hit the button by the bed, which turned off the smart                     |
| 47:59      | outlet, which then meant that the robot vacuum lost its stock.                                                |
| 48:04      | And so left and started beeping because it couldn't find its stock.                                           |
| 48:08      | So it started wandering around looking for a stock at which point he would get up, press                      |
| 48:12      | a button and go downstairs, which would turn on the smart outlet.                                             |
| 48:15      | So it would then go, oh, hey, I found my dog, I can go home.                                                  |
| 48:18      | And he would just go downstairs and see that it was going back to its stock.                                  |
| 48:22      | And okay, that's fine.                                                                                        |
| 48:23      | And then he realised, yeah, and then he realised it was because it was plugged into a smart                   |
| 48:27      | outlet.                                                                                                       |
| 48:28      | And if he just plugged it straight into the wall, then everything would be fine.                              |
| 48:33      | And so I genuinely thought I'd done that.                                                                     |
| 48:35      | And then I realised that I'd put the find robot vacuum button in there by accident.                           |
| 48:39      | It was not light.                                                                                             |
| 48:41      | So with all my lights, you know, because we have the Lutron Casetas, we went with switches                   |
| 48:45      | instead of light bulbs, because I live in my house and I have one, one Lutron switch                          |
| 48:52      | in my side, you know, next to my bed there, if I push it, it turns all the lights on in                       |
| 48:57      | the house.                                                                                                    |
| 48:58      | So if you hear a noise at night, you know, except for the bedrooms, it turns the lights                       |
| 49:01      | on downstairs.                                                                                                |
| 49:02      | So you're using, you're using the app to like set the scene setting, the scene setting in                     |
| 49:06      | there to say like, when I, but you have to do that in the app because it doesn't work                         |
| 49:09      | with HomeKit, but you could talk to other devices.                                                            |
| 49:12      | I need to look at that because so that works.                                                                 |
| 49:15      | Then you got like that.                                                                                       |
| 49:16      | We got two dimmer switches.                                                                                   |
| 49:17      | You have a similar thing?                                                                                     |
| 49:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 49:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 49:20      | We've got a bunch of them.                                                                                    |
| 49:21      | I've been adding them slowly, you know, it's kind of been my hobby.                                           |
| 49:23      | It's like, okay, I'm going to spend another $50 this month, which room am I going to wire                     |
| 49:28      | up?                                                                                                           |
| 49:29      | And at this point, basically the whole house is wired up.                                                     |
| 49:32      | And so I've installed these switches everywhere and it's really great because you don't have                  |
| 49:36      | to buy individual bulbs and, and I've got, like I said, I've got this remote in my side                       |
| 49:41      | bed.                                                                                                          |
| 49:42      | So you hear a noise at night.                                                                                 |
| 49:43      | I can turn all the lights on and go down.                                                                     |
| 49:44      | You don't have to go into the dark, you know, but every night I put eye drops in my eyes                      |
| 49:50      | and my eyes are closed and I go to put the drops back in the drawer and I hit the button                      |
| 49:55      | and my wife is downstairs working.                                                                            |
| 49:58      | And just like there's a button to turn all the lights on.                                                     |
| 50:00      | If you hit the other side of the button, you turn all the lights in the house off.                            |
| 50:03      | And if I end up getting divorced, it will be because of that.                                                 |
| 50:09      | I recently, okay, so you see this here in my small automation area, but I had to mention                      |
| 50:13      | this because this is exactly the kind of stupid brain I've got.                                               |
| 50:17      | So we've got a Lutron cassette dimmer in our, we call it the nook, like a little like miniature               |
| 50:23      | dining room that's kind of also like where we build Lego and stuff like that.                                 |
| 50:27      | But yeah, the nook, right?                                                                                    |
| 50:28      | So we got the cassette and it's great.                                                                        |
| 50:30      | So I've got that hooked up to an overhead lamp from IKEA with, I've really, I'm really                        |
| 50:35      | starting to love these bright LED bulbs.                                                                      |
| 50:38      | LED is finally catching up and getting better.                                                                |
| 50:41      | The one of the downsides of the Phillips Hue lights is I turn 54 in two days and I can't                      |
| 50:46      | see anything anymore.                                                                                         |
| 50:47      | I need really bright light, three giant, beautiful, slightly dimmable, but not great LED lights               |
| 50:54      | in the overhead.                                                                                              |
| 50:55      | Casetaa works great for that.                                                                                |
| 50:56      | But you know what, I also wanted to have my wife likes to hang out there and drink coffee                     |
| 50:59      | in the morning with not bright lights.                                                                        |
| 51:01      | So I put a Hue light in a small lamp and it's nice and warm and beautiful, but they can't                     |
| 51:08      | really talk to each other because the Lutron, you know what I mean?                                           |
| 51:11      | They're kind of in different ecosystems.                                                                      |
| 51:13      | So you know what I finally did?                                                                               |
| 51:14      | I think I did this in Home Plus.                                                                              |
| 51:15      | I don't even remember.                                                                                        |
| 51:16      | I did the most boneheaded thing.                                                                              |
| 51:18      | So the thing is you hit the Casetaa, well, the other light's still on.                                       |
| 51:21      | You turn the other light off, the Casetaa's still on.                                                        |
| 51:24      | So I set it so the Hue bulb is watching the Casetaa setting and if the overhead light                        |
| 51:32      | is all the way off, it turns itself off.                                                                      |
| 51:36      | If the overhead light is on at all, it turns itself on.                                                       |
| 51:39      | So that was my hack.                                                                                          |
| 51:40      | That was my solution is when I hit the Casetaa, now some other system is monitoring the status               |
| 51:45      | of that overhead light and Rose, I'm sure you could tell me a more efficient way to                           |
| 51:48      | do that.                                                                                                      |
| 51:49      | But that's the kind of thing where I end up spending time is like, how do I make this                         |
| 51:52      | usable to other people in a fairly intuitive way without getting into what you're describing                  |
| 51:57      | David?                                                                                                        |
| 51:58      | Which is like, boy, on the one hand, like to turn on a light, you want it to be fast.                         |
| 52:02      | But also that means you can turn off a light fast and set off an entire like making Pee                       |

| 52:13      | Well there's a lot of different ways we can solve all of these problems and that is both                      |
| 52:16      | the beauty and the curse of automation, I feel.                                                               |
| 52:20      | All right, before we start recording today, Merlin mentioned a word that we haven't talked                    |
| 52:25      | about much on the automators, but I've wanted to cover this for some time.                                    |
| 52:30      | [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                            |
| 52:31      | It sounds to me like you're using it a lot.                                                                   |
| 52:33      | What are you doing with it?                                                                                   |
| 52:34      | I'm not using it a lot, a lot.                                                                                |
| 52:36      | Once again, yet another thing I learned about from [[Brett Terpstra]].                                            |
| 52:39      | And so what was I using it for?                                                                               |
| 52:40      | Originally, I was, it was just so hamfisted on my Mac here at work on my iMac, I was using                    |
| 52:46      | it to basically do F key things.                                                                              |
| 52:48      | It was, I'm very, don't get me started, I'm very intrigued by Keyboard Maestro, but I'm                       |
| 52:53      | terrified by Keyboard Maestro.                                                                                |
| 52:55      | First because of its complexity, but even more because of that's exactly the kind of                          |
| 53:00      | thing I could spend a month on.                                                                               |
| 53:01      | And I don't want to do that.                                                                                  |
| 53:03      | [[BetterTouchTool]] was like a fairly intuitive way to do things I wanted to like.                              |
| 53:08      | So for example, here on my Das keyboard, when I hit, you know, F13 that opens NV alts, 14                     |
| 53:14      | opens Drafts, 15 opens Taskpaper, 12 enters my phone number, et cetera.                                      |
| 53:20      | And I just wanted some really simple bonehead things like that.                                               |
| 53:23      | When I ill-advisedly too early purchased the 2019 MacBook Pro, really wish I'd waited a                       |
| 53:29      | little longer.                                                                                                |
| 53:30      | Boy, that the touch bar, yeah.                                                                                |
| 53:34      | And so I was, it's not great, but I was using [[BetterTouchTool]] on that on the laptop to                      |
| 53:39      | do things that are very similar things like open Taskpaper, open this, open that.                            |
| 53:42      | I know there's so much more that I can do with it, but that's the kind of basic stuff                         |
| 53:46      | I've done.                                                                                                    |
| 53:47      | I feel like I first learned about it though in the service of using literally a touchpad,                     |
| 53:51      | which I'm not great at.                                                                                       |
| 53:52      | Like I much prefer this Logitech mouse because I have not mastered the touchpad.                              |
| 54:00      | There are things I love about a touchpad.                                                                     |
| 54:02      | I would miss having a scroll wheel, but that's how I initially started, I think, was being                    |
| 54:06      | able to do stuff on my laptop with the touchpad.                                                              |
| 54:09      | So much you can do in that app.                                                                               |
| 54:10      | It's a little bit overwhelming.                                                                               |
| 54:11      | Yeah, he's really grown it over the years.                                                                    |
| 54:13      | I mean, it started out just being a tool for improving the mouse or the touchpad.                             |
| 54:19      | But like you said, you're mapping function keys to it, the touch bar, it really can                           |
| 54:26      | go a long way for an automator.                                                                               |
| 54:28      | Absolutely.                                                                                                   |
| 54:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 54:30      | Yeah, I know there's more I can do with it, but we're here on a podcast about automation.                     |
| 54:35      | So we're talking about automation.                                                                            |
| 54:37      | And then, but the other thing to talk about when you talk about automation is like doing                      |
| 54:39      | the rest of your stuff.                                                                                       |
| 54:40      | So I've got a lot of projects where I want to get into a thing, but it's also that like                       |
| 54:45      | I do feel like I'm already a cautionary tale in so many ways with this stuff.                                 |
| 54:50      | I want to find the right balance, but also I'm always so hungry for like the next thing                       |
| 54:55      | that I could do with this and is I believe in your trade, your former trade or current                        |
| 55:00      | trade, David, as soon as an attractive nuisance.                                                              |
| 55:02      | Like that pile of garbage that a kid could climb on, we got to do something, put a fence                      |
| 55:07      | around that.                                                                                                  |
| 55:08      | Put a fence around a lot of this stuff.                                                                       |
| 55:11      | So I don't end up climbing garbage all day.                                                                   |
| 55:13      | That was a terrible analogy.                                                                                  |
| 55:16      | Understandable though.                                                                                        |
| 55:17      | Understandable.                                                                                               |
| 55:18      | That is one of these things where it's so easy to fall into the trap of, oh, but if                           |
| 55:23      | I just spend five minutes and then three hours later you look up and you go, wait, what?                      |
| 55:29      | How did my day just disappear?                                                                                |
| 55:30      | That was one of Danny O'Brien's primary observations.                                                         |
| 55:33      | I feel like in some ways with his famous original life hacks talk was that, you know,                         |
| 55:38      | for better or for worse, geeks frequently would rather spend like an hour writing a script                    |
| 55:44      | for this than having, you know, their time wasted, you know, for five minutes, 12 times.                      |
| 55:51      | You know what I'm saying?                                                                                     |
| 55:52      | Like I would much rather fix this once, patch the roof rather than trying to find an innovative               |
| 55:57      | way to capture the water.                                                                                     |
| 55:58      | I would like to solve the problem.                                                                            |
| 55:59      | And part of the beauty and the curse, as you say, the original life hacks, which of course                    |
| 56:04      | has been mangled over the years was that most of the time a life hack was a fairly inelegant                  |
| 56:08      | solution to something, you know, like I dropped a photo in here at the top of the page that                   |
| 56:14      | I feel like really summarises automation, which is the drinking bird that Homer Simpson                       |
| 56:19      | uses to hit the Y key over and over.                                                                          |
| 56:22      | That's really, I mean, on the one hand, if you just need this one little thing, you could                     |
| 56:25      | get a bird that pecks at a key and that's going to fix it, not elegant, but it fixes                          |
| 56:30      | it.                                                                                                           |
| 56:31      | And there's also the thing of like, well, what if, what if I don't want it to, what                           |
| 56:34      | if I wanted to stop hitting the Y key after 5pm?                                                              |
| 56:37      | And that's where we get really wound up in this stuff is now, if you're not careful,                          |
| 56:42      | you end up using, you know, super glue and rubber bands to try and make your whole life                       |
| 56:45      | work together.                                                                                                |
| 56:46      | And you have to have the presence of mind to say, up to this point, this is useful past                       |
| 56:51      | this point, it's not as wholesome.                                                                            |
| 56:54      | That's the challenge to me.                                                                                   |
| 56:55      | And for a lot of us, this is fun, you know, that, and Rose and I talk about it all the                        |
| 56:58      | time, you know, one of the reasons we make this shows is we both find ourselves texting                       |
| 57:04      | each other at all hours of the day saying, Hey, I'm trying to do this right now.                              |
| 57:08      | How do you do this?                                                                                           |
| 57:09      | Or something like that.                                                                                       |
| 57:11      | And it becomes a hobby in essence.                                                                            |
| 57:14      | But even for someone like Rose, who's a developer and an automator, there are limits.                         |
| 57:20      | And I think you do have to be kind of self aware of that.                                                     |
| 57:24      | You were talking earlier about task managers and automation, and I get probably weekly                        |
| 57:30      | an email from somebody because I talk a lot about OmniFocus and I talk about automation                       |
| 57:34      | and people take those two things and they combine them and they find themselves with                          |
| 57:39      | a OmniFocus database that has 10,000 tasks in it because they're so good at automating.                       |
| 57:45      | They've built themselves into prison.                                                                         |
| 57:47      | It is something bitterly, bitterly ironic about that though.                                                  |
| 57:51      | I mean, and I don't mean this as a slam, but I just, I know where I speak at the moment                       |
| 57:56      | you find yourself noticing how much time you're spending choosing, learning, developing, taxonomising,        |
| 58:05      | a task management app, boy, really use that moment to say like, every minute I spend playing                  |
| 58:12      | with this, I should spend five minutes getting these things done, getting like doing the                      |
| 58:16      | things on the list.                                                                                           |
| 58:17      | That is a, it's like I say, it's a pocket, not an attic.                                                      |
| 58:21      | That's a place for like active stuff that you're doing and everybody's got to do you.                         |
| 58:26      | Do you do you?                                                                                                |
| 58:27      | That's what I say to everybody, but when you find yourself, and that's one reason I went                      |
| 58:31      | to Taskpaper is I didn't want to be able to do anything too sophisticated.                                   |
| 58:35      | And when I find myself saying, oh, this project, I wish I could create a semantic start date                  |
| 58:41      | where it would disappear and like I could probably script that, no, you already do that                       |
| 58:45      | in OmniFocus.                                                                                                 |
| 58:46      | The reason you're in Taskpaper is because you have stuff to do, not stuff you want to                        |
| 58:50      | think about and taxonomise.                                                                                   |
| 58:52      | And that, that, that is that presence of mind has been valuable for me.                                       |
| 58:55      | I still love OmniFocus.                                                                                       |
| 58:56      | I just don't have enough different kinds of work to be, to like really be utilising OmniFocus.                |
| 59:03      | I got podcasts and then they're done.                                                                         |
| 59:05      | You record them, you write the show notes, you do the things, you buy bread, you put                          |
| 59:09      | up a curtain, like all these, just these little things and it's like at the moment I'm so                     |
| 59:14      | grateful for the moments I catch myself going, stop overthinking this, do the work.                           |
| 59:20      | And if it's just stuff, even in the Taskpaper stuff accumulates, I got all this stuff and                    |
| 59:23      | you know what I do?                                                                                           |
| 59:24      | I delete it all and start over.                                                                               |
| 59:25      | How could you possibly do that?                                                                               |
| 59:27      | Well, that's the thing.                                                                                       |
| 59:28      | If they're not getting done, that's, this should be my brain trying to tell me something.                     |
| 59:32      | Right here.                                                                                                   |
| 59:33      | Got this pad of paper.                                                                                        |
| 59:34      | So much of what I do now is just jotting stuff on this pad of paper, I cross it off                           |
| 59:38      | at the end of the day, I tear off the sheet and I throw it away.                                              |
| 59:41      | I could certainly get into, like I say, whether it's OmniFocus, Emacs, whatever it is.                        |
| 59:46      | If you need to get the tool that fits what you need and then use it efficiently in the                        |
| 59:51      | service of what you're trying to do, but also be aware and catch yourself when you're going                   |
| 59:56      | off the rails with trying to be super productive with something that's meant to just help you                 |
| 01:00:01   | be productive.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:00:03   | Well, I think that's the trick really is the automation, automation is great for processing                   |
| 01:00:08   | things you've added to OmniFocus, but the human needs the person needs to be the one                          |
| 01:00:12   | adding the tasks because if you introduce automation, you're just creating this pile                          |
| 01:00:17   | of work for yourself that is an actual work.                                                                  |
| 01:00:20   | Agreed.                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:21   | I mean, it very much depends.                                                                                 |
| 01:00:22   | I find that if I don't have an automation to add certain things because those things                          |
| 01:00:25   | are assigned to me automatically elsewhere, then those things will not get done because                       |
| 01:00:29   | I am very used to my system and my setup.                                                                     |
| 01:00:32   | So it very much depends on the person.                                                                        |
| 01:00:33   | But yes, I would generally say that if you have automation just dumping a bunch of stuff                      |
| 01:00:39   | into your system, then it would be worth taking a look at the why behind it because sometimes                 |
| 01:00:45   | it's not always a good thing.                                                                                 |
| 01:00:48   | That leads to a very general pattern that I'll just mention quickly in passing.                               |
| 01:00:51   | This has become something, something that's so general as to sound not useful.                                |
| 01:00:55   | And yet I find it incredibly useful, which is in your life, in your adult life in particular,                 |
| 01:01:00   | a lot of, there's a lot of things in your life where you need to figure out where it                          |
| 01:01:05   | goes, like whatever, whatever that thing is.                                                                  |
| 01:01:08   | So I'm deliberately being very general.                                                                       |
| 01:01:10   | Where does this thing go?                                                                                     |
| 01:01:12   | And I feel like if you become aware of that as an important pattern, a lot of stuff will                      |
| 01:01:17   | start making a lot more sense.                                                                                |
| 01:01:19   | So that could be something like, as I say, like I want my forks to be in the cutlery drawer,                  |
| 01:01:23   | even though there's more room in the garage and the garage, the forks are not as useful                       |
| 01:01:26   | to me.                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:27   | I need them to be here.                                                                                       |
| 01:01:28   | But where do other things go?                                                                                 |
| 01:01:30   | Well, the task that I need to do, David Allen would say, if you can do the task now, why                      |
| 01:01:35   | would you even write it down?                                                                                 |
| 01:01:36   | Just go do the thing.                                                                                         |
| 01:01:37   | What?                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:38   | You want the satisfaction of seeing it crossed out on a page?                                                 |
| 01:01:41   | Stay focused on where the thing goes.                                                                         |
| 01:01:43   | It's, you know, and for example, I talked about this recently on the Do By Friday podcast,                    |
| 01:01:47   | but the very, very, very, widest general concept of lists.                                                    |
| 01:01:52   | So lists could be to-do lists, but lists are also things like the album inside of photos                      |
| 01:01:57   | where I put home kit codes, because I'm going to need it again.                                               |
| 01:02:00   | I don't need that $5 app for that.                                                                            |
| 01:02:02   | I could just put it in, and that's a list.                                                                    |
| 01:02:05   | That's the capture point.                                                                                     |
| 01:02:06   | Got a home kit device?                                                                                        |
| 01:02:07   | You take a photo, you put it there.                                                                           |
| 01:02:09   | Good new power pop song.                                                                                       |
| 01:02:10   | Guess where that goes on this Spotify list?                                                                   |
| 01:02:13   | I'm trying to abstract this as widely as possible, but start thinking about one of your goals                 |
| 01:02:17   | in adult life as a professional, personal, whatever it is.                                                    |
| 01:02:20   | Where does this thing go?                                                                                     |
| 01:02:22   | Is it still in the right place?                                                                               |
| 01:02:23   | Does this belong somewhere else?                                                                              |
| 01:02:25   | You can abstract that pattern in the most sort of muscular ways by saying like, well,                         |
| 01:02:29   | one reason I'm having a problem with this is because this thing's not in the right place.                     |
| 01:02:33   | How about this?                                                                                               |
| 01:02:34   | You lose something.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:35   | Right?                                                                                                        |
| 01:02:36   | You mislaid your keys.                                                                                        |
| 01:02:38   | Where is the first place you look for your keys?                                                              |
| 01:02:40   | I don't know, but like you have an idea, right?                                                               |
| 01:02:43   | Why don't you start keeping your keys there?                                                                  |
| 01:02:45   | That's where your keys wanted to be.                                                                          |
| 01:02:46   | If you keep finding stuff you lost in this same area, it's not where it needs to be.                          |
| 01:02:51   | If for example, in your kitchen, your home, your office, whatever it is, is this thing                        |
| 01:02:56   | where it needs to be?                                                                                         |
| 01:02:57   | No, that's garbage.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:58   | That needs to go.                                                                                             |
| 01:02:59   | This could be made more efficient if we clean out this pantry, then that's where those things                 |
| 01:03:03   | go.                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:04   | I know this sounds dumb.                                                                                      |
| 01:03:05   | It sounds obvious, but think about where something needs to go.                                               |
| 01:03:08   | Where is that friction being generated and can you minimise it?                                               |
| 01:03:11   | To me, starting with that very practical approach then gives you a ton of ways to utilise this                |
| 01:03:17   | stuff with a built-in governor that tells you when you've moved past where the thing                          |
| 01:03:22   | belongs into this fantasy land.                                                                               |
| 01:03:23   | Tinkering is fun, but know when you're tinkering.                                                             |
| 01:03:27   | Know when, in the case of somebody like me, this is not a developer for a living.                             |
| 01:03:31   | Do I really want to learn this new language because I bought a device that I could program?                   |
| 01:03:38   | No.                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:39   | That's not where that goes.                                                                                   |
| 01:03:40   | Anyway, just a big pattern.                                                                                   |
| 01:03:41   | Start looking for it.                                                                                         |
| 01:03:42   | Where does this go?                                                                                           |
| 01:03:43   | I think that works in a lot of ways with digital taxonomy as well.                                            |
| 01:03:50   | Tagging is a good one.                                                                                        |
| 01:03:51   | People always say, well, how do you tag?                                                                      |
| 01:03:53   | Well, the way I tag something wouldn't matter if you ask me.                                                  |
| 01:03:57   | The way you tag it is what matters.                                                                           |
| 01:04:00   | What's the tag you would use for this file?                                                                   |
| 01:04:03   | That's the one you're going to go to.                                                                         |
| 01:04:05   | If I can't find it the first time I look for it, the Dr. Drang post on what to enter in                       |
| 01:04:11   | the terminal to reset your launch services.                                                                   |
| 01:04:13   | I know there's other ways to do it.                                                                           |
| 01:04:15   | I have so many, as you know, David, REFX, REFX reference files, and every time I can't                        |
| 01:04:21   | find it, I instantly rename it this whole diarrhea of nouns about what I was searching                        |
| 01:04:28   | for but couldn't find it.                                                                                     |
| 01:04:30   | That's compensatory muscles for your brain.                                                                   |
| 01:04:32   | If you didn't find it the one way, that doesn't mean you should create a new taxonomy.                        |
| 01:04:37   | It means you patch up this one thing that failed you here, but put the thing where you're                     |
| 01:04:43   | going to need it, not where you think it should go.                                                           |
| 01:04:47   | If you think too much about where the thing should go or the aesthetic way to do that,                        |
| 01:04:51   | well, to me, it's much more intuitive to look at where it is my right hand want to go to                      |
| 01:04:55   | grab this pan.                                                                                                |
| 01:04:56   | Wouldn't it be great if I had a way to store that pan there?                                                  |
| 01:04:59   | It doesn't work for everything, but if you interrogate the where stuff belongs or where                       |
| 01:05:04   | stuff goes, a lot more stuff starts falling in place, and the friction becomes clear.                         |
| 01:05:09   | Definitely.                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:10   | This was something I solved recently.                                                                         |
| 01:05:11   | I realised that I was not running a particular shortcut when I wanted to run it, so I tried                   |
| 01:05:17   | to figure out how to get that in front of me at the right time of day, and I realised                         |
| 01:05:22   | that there were a bunch of different ways to do it, but the easiest way was to put it                         |
| 01:05:25   | in a widget on my home screen.                                                                                |
| 01:05:27   | I just put it in a widget on my home screen, and it's there, and now I tap it, and it does                    |
| 01:05:32   | the thing.                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:33   | I'm considering adding some further automation to go ahead and say, okay, well, she's tapping                 |
| 01:05:40   | this after, say, 8 p.m., then it means that she's going to bed, where she taps it after                       |
| 01:05:44   | 8 a.m., then it's during the day, and it's cloudy outside to turn on the lights, but                          |
| 01:05:48   | I've decided for the time being, I'm just going to stick with the, guess what?                                |
| 01:05:52   | It's time to go to bed, and so run all these things and dim the lights, and check the windows                 |
| 01:05:57   | and make sure that she knows if any windows are open, that need closing, et cetera.                           |

| 01:07:27   | Our thanks to Setup for their support of the Automators and all of Relay FM.                                  |
| 01:07:33   | So we can talk about automation.                                                                              |
| 01:07:34   | What are we doing here?                                                                                       |
| 01:07:35   | This is running long.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:36   | Let me talk about automation.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:37   | Let's automate some things.                                                                                   |
| 01:07:39   | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:40   | Yes.                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:41   | So you mentioned [[BetterTouchTool]], but something else you mentioned before the show, which                   |
| 01:07:43   | I definitely want to ask you about, is Bunch, because I've heard of Bunch, but I think a                      |
| 01:07:49   | lot of our listeners have not heard of Bunch.                                                                 |
| 01:07:51   | So can you give us a quick overview of what is Bunch, and how are you using it?                               |
| 01:07:54   | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:55   | Genius, the guy who's basically my muse, but like, God, [[Brett Terpstra]] makes so much stuff                    |
| 01:08:03   | that I use like every day, like things inside of things.                                                      |
| 01:08:07   | I use [[Brett Terpstra\|Brett Terpstra's]] services inside of his apps.                                                           |
| 01:08:10   | So much.                                                                                                      |
| 01:08:11   | He created this thing called Bunch.                                                                           |
| 01:08:12   | That's such a clever idea.                                                                                    |
| 01:08:13   | So the idea with [[Bunch]] is there's stuff you want to do at certain times, like there's                         |
| 01:08:17   | certain sets of conditions you want to set up, and there's ways to automate that in different                 |
| 01:08:22   | places.                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:23   | The way he chose to do this is, I think, incredibly clever.                                                   |
| 01:08:26   | So I don't know the order he did this in, but basically you have a text file,.txt,                            |
| 01:08:30   | but it's called.bunch, and each line in that is a line that you put in that does a thing.                     |
| 01:08:35   | So in the same way that I would introduce [[LaunchBar]] or [[Alfred]] by saying, hey, if you                          |
| 01:08:39   | type the first few letters of Microsoft Word, it knows you mean Microsoft Word, you hit                       |
| 01:08:44   | enter and it opens.                                                                                           |
| 01:08:45   | Right?                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:46   | Wow, that's really cool.                                                                                      |
| 01:08:47   | Let's begin.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:48   | There's so much more.                                                                                         |
| 01:08:49   | So let's take that same example here.                                                                         |
| 01:08:51   | When I started a podcast, I wanted to launch Skype, and I need to open this, but let's                        |
| 01:08:57   | just say you've got words and then you've got things like punctuation that mean things.                       |
| 01:09:04   | So if I do this, it's going to open Skype.                                                                    |
| 01:09:07   | If I do this, it's going to quit Skype.                                                                       |
| 01:09:09   | If I do this, it's going to open this URL.                                                                    |
| 01:09:12   | If I do that, it's going to open this Finder window, et cetera, et cetera.                                    |
| 01:09:16   | But it goes further than that.                                                                                |
| 01:09:17   | He's added so much to this.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:19   | I mean, the basic part of it is, like for me, I have a bunch called Start Podcast, and                        |
| 01:09:24   | that does what?                                                                                               |
| 01:09:25   | It opens Skype.                                                                                               |
| 01:09:26   | It opens Audio Hijack.                                                                                        |
| 01:09:28   | It quits Dropbox.                                                                                             |
| 01:09:29   | It quits Plex.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:31   | It turns on Do Not Disturb.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:33   | Get this.                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:34   | Fairly recently, I think you added this.                                                                      |
| 01:09:36   | I changed the audio input and output to my USB pre too, right?                                                |
| 01:09:42   | Each line means something.                                                                                    |
| 01:09:44   | And so basically, it's just a way of saying, under the given these conditions, I want the                     |
| 01:09:48   | following things to happen on my Mac.                                                                         |
| 01:09:51   | And he even has stuff like [[AppleScript]] support in there.                                                     |
| 01:09:54   | He's added a thing now, talk about quick keys.                                                                |
| 01:09:56   | He's added a thing now where you could say, in this app, go and hit this key command.                         |
| 01:10:01   | Really wild, kind of hacky stuff, but it works pretty great.                                                  |
| 01:10:05   | And I could see lots of situations where a bunch would be in pretty easy.                                     |
| 01:10:09   | You know what?                                                                                                |
| 01:10:10   | It's a pretty fun, easy-ish app to nerd out with.                                                             |
| 01:10:13   | You don't have to go crazy with it, but I bet you could think of situations where, let's                      |
| 01:10:17   | say you're going into a meeting, your weekly stand-up meeting, right?                                         |
| 01:10:21   | You could have something that says on my Mac, turn on Do Not Disturb, open this file where                    |
| 01:10:26   | I keep my notes, you know, all these different things.                                                        |
| 01:10:30   | Even if you have like four or five lines in there, having that and then not having to                         |
| 01:10:33   | think about it is delightful.                                                                                 |
| 01:10:35   | And to me, the real beauty is, like I say, I won't call it Start Podcast, and it opens                        |
| 01:10:39   | all the things.                                                                                               |
| 01:10:40   | I call it End Podcast, and that's equally powerful because it changes my audio input                          |
| 01:10:45   | and output back.                                                                                              |
| 01:10:47   | It turns Do Not Disturb off.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:48   | It opens up Ecamm because I know I'm going to want to like export my call recorders, put                      |
| 01:10:53   | the tracks.                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:54   | It opens up the folders for all of the different podcasts.                                                    |
| 01:10:58   | Last thing, he added something I've wanted forever.                                                           |
| 01:11:00   | I have not fully explored this, but you can now sort of, what's the word, alias or nest,                      |
| 01:11:06   | you know, I believe you can now do bunches in other bunches.                                                  |
| 01:11:09   | So you could basically have, you could abstract out, this is the thing that involves every                    |
| 01:11:13   | kind of podcast, no matter what.                                                                              |
| 01:11:16   | This is for this particular podcast.                                                                          |
| 01:11:18   | So that opens Zoom instead of Skype or what have you.                                                         |
| 01:11:21   | So I would just say it's a, it would be a fun thing for people to whack around in because                     |
| 01:11:25   | it is instantly going to be useful.                                                                           |
| 01:11:27   | It is a little bit fun and nerdy, and if you want to go deeper on it, there's a lot more                      |
| 01:11:31   | that you can do, and you're doing it all in a text file with just lines of text.                              |
| 01:11:35   | That's all it is.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:36   | And I think it's incredibly powerful, and I believe it's free.                                                |
| 01:11:39   | But you can donate.                                                                                           |
| 01:11:40   | And I feel like it gets a new feature every time Brett needs a new feature, you know?                         |
| 01:11:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:46   | So you'll open it up one day and it's just got like the do not disturb thing is fairly                        |
| 01:11:50   | recent.                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:51   | But it's like he must have needed it for something because he added it, you know?                             |
| 01:11:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:56   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:57   | But it's, it's, there's something so satisfying.                                                              |
| 01:11:58   | It's I, I often find myself falling back to talking about Markdown where like, you know,                      |
| 01:12:01   | you could be like John Siracusa and write in HTML, but I, I could do that in [[BBEdit]],                         |
| 01:12:07   | but I really like using Markdown because Markdown has the subset of formatting things that I                  |
| 01:12:13   | generally need.                                                                                               |
| 01:12:14   | And so I think of Markdown as like this very simplified version of what can become HTML.                      |
| 01:12:20   | But like originally Markdown was like a way of turning this plain text into plain text                        |
| 01:12:23   | HTML.                                                                                                         |
| 01:12:24   | Now I just live in Markdown Taskpaper.                                                                       |
| 01:12:27   | It's like Markdown for tasks, right?                                                                          |
| 01:12:29   | I just got a bunch of lines.                                                                                  |
| 01:12:30   | There's basically three kinds of objects in Taskpaper.                                                       |
| 01:12:34   | Anything I do to make that overly complex is on me, not on them.                                              |
| 01:12:37   | And now you look at a bunch.                                                                                  |
| 01:12:38   | What's bunch?                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:39   | Well, bunch is kind of like, think of it almost like automator, but in a text file.                           |
| 01:12:43   | I love the idea that I'm going to take this very minimal thing.                                               |
| 01:12:46   | I don't need to learn an entire platform.                                                                     |
| 01:12:48   | And I love the idea that this keeps me focused on, I'll have to learn some tricks for what                    |
| 01:12:53   | it's called, you know, how it's formatted, that kind of stuff.                                                |
| 01:12:57   | And then off I go.                                                                                            |
| 01:12:58   | And I'm not even thinking about it anymore.                                                                   |
| 01:13:00   | I will take a solution like that anytime.                                                                     |
| 01:13:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:03   | I mean, the fact that it's based on a text file, I think would probably just push your                        |
| 01:13:06   | buttons just to start.                                                                                        |
| 01:13:08   | It doesn't take much, but that helps.                                                                         |
| 01:13:11   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:12   | And you're still writing generally in Markdown for everything, right?                                         |
| 01:13:16   | Correct.                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:17   | I use, so the writing that I do is relatively ephemeral.                                                      |
| 01:13:20   | I mean, it's all, well, ephemeral, it's meaningful to me, but doing things like writing show                  |
| 01:13:24   | notes is a big part of what I do.                                                                             |
| 01:13:28   | I have, like I say, I have a lot of text files that kind of run my life.                                      |
| 01:13:31   | And so I write a lot using the Markdown format, depending on what I'm doing, it might be an                   |
| 01:13:37   | NV alt or it might be in a more richer formatted thing.                                                       |
| 01:13:43   | But then I use another one of [[Brett Terpstra\|Brett's]] apps, [[Marked2\|Marked]], Mark 2, to preview what I'm doing there.                  |
| 01:13:50   | And then all of that is just so improbably portable.                                                          |
| 01:13:56   | It blows my mind.                                                                                             |
| 01:13:57   | Oh, so David, David, I heard about an app, [[Alex Cox\|Alex]] told me about an app you like called                          |
| 01:14:00   | [[Obsidian]].                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:14:02   | And I had never heard of it.                                                                                  |
| 01:14:04   | And so I went and I wanted to go and just play with that and just to see what it's like.                      |
| 01:14:08   | And it's such an interesting idea for an app.                                                                 |
| 01:14:10   | So what I, I eventually ended up starting over with a new vault.                                              |
| 01:14:13   | But the very first thing I did was to just copy the corpus of 2,500 text files that I                         |
| 01:14:19   | live in.                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:20   | And it's so wild to me in this day and age of 4K movies.                                                      |
| 01:14:24   | It's so wild to me that the rich history of years and years and years of text files that                      |
| 01:14:28   | I've got, it's got to be under a few megs.                                                                    |
| 01:14:31   | I just hit copy and it's done.                                                                                |
| 01:14:34   | Text files, so light, so portable.                                                                            |
| 01:14:36   | And like, there's something really satisfying, amusing to me about that.                                      |
| 01:14:42   | I can have a 60 gig movie over here, but like all of that information that's been valuable                    |
| 01:14:48   | to me, all lives in those little text files that could fit on a thumb drive with room                         |
| 01:14:52   | for apocalypse now, leftover.                                                                                 |
| 01:14:54   | I have the same experience because I've been writing in Markdown for like 10 years and                        |
| 01:14:59   | I did the same thing and Obsidian is basically a structure you can put on top of your Markdown                |
| 01:15:04   | files, but there's still just your Markdown files.                                                            |
| 01:15:08   | But I also know that you use [[Drafts]] a lot, don't you?                                                         |
| 01:15:10   | I mean, I've seen you write and make reference to it.                                                         |
| 01:15:13   | Oh, I love Drafts.                                                                                            |
| 01:15:15   | [[Drafts]] is where text starts.                                                                                  |
| 01:15:16   | I love that it's cross-platform.                                                                              |
| 01:15:18   | The magic of the way that Greg has, I have no idea, Rose, I wonder if this blows your                         |
| 01:15:23   | mind too.                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:25   | He started out with this Mac app, he made an iOS app, but how would you possibly create                       |
| 01:15:33   | functionalities that work on both of those platforms?                                                         |
| 01:15:37   | Mind-blowing to me, and not all of them do, but like a shocking amount of things in [[Drafts]]                   |
| 01:15:41   | will just work and sync and do the thing on iOS and the Mac, which is mind-blowing to                         |
| 01:15:47   | me.                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:48   | But the only thing that keeps me from being all in on Drafts, this is so embarrassing.                        |
| 01:15:55   | It's just I have to be candid.                                                                                |
| 01:15:57   | I still use editorial on my phone.                                                                            |
| 01:16:00   | Editorial's been dead forever, but you know what it is?                                                       |
| 01:16:03   | I really like the Taskpaper app on the Mac.                                                                  |
| 01:16:09   | That's open almost all the time on my Mac, and I like the GUI, the interface for that.                        |
| 01:16:14   | It's incredibly limiting to have that be the gating factor, because [[Drafts]] will do all                        |
| 01:16:20   | of that stuff, and [[Drafts]] has all that functionality.                                                         |
| 01:16:22   | You just got to wire it up, but that's the one thing that keeps me from going all the                         |
| 01:16:26   | way in on Drafts, is I still like having separate text files, A, that can be in places like                   |
| 01:16:32   | Dropbox, B, air go, that lets me have a Taskpaper document that I can use in those different                 |
| 01:16:38   | places, and every couple of weeks I go back to seeing, can I do this all with Drafts?                         |
| 01:16:42   | I'm just not quite there yet.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:43   | Tell me, talk me out of this, give me all in on Drafts, what do I have to do?                                 |
| 01:16:47   | It [[Drafts]] has Taskpaper formatting, and it will sync those things, and I have a workspace                    |
| 01:16:54   | in Drafts.                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:55   | I have one for my OmniFocus templates, actually, and when I switch to that, I set it up so                    |
| 01:17:00   | that it switches my action groups, so that's the one on the right-hand side and the one                       |
| 01:17:04   | above the keyboard.                                                                                           |
| 01:17:05   | But it's iCloud only, and I can't get that on the Mac.                                                        |
| 01:17:09   | I can't get the TaskPaper file in the TaskPaper app on the Mac, which officially makes                       |
| 01:17:15   | me an old man, but do you understand what I mean?                                                             |
| 01:17:18   | I don't have a way to like-                                                                                   |
| 01:17:20   | I just use the [[Drafts]] app for everything, which is-                                                           |
| 01:17:25   | I guess I could, yeah, I don't know what's wrong with this.                                                   |
| 01:17:28   | Maybe you should give it another try.                                                                         |
| 01:17:29   | You should give it another try.                                                                               |
| 01:17:30   | I'll give it another try.                                                                                     |
| 01:17:31   | You know I will, you know?                                                                                    |
| 01:17:32   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:17:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:17:34   | I know you will, and you'll give it another try, and you'll probably go back to your                          |
| 01:17:36   | favourite way of using the Taskpaper app on the Mac and editorial on your iPhone.                             |
| 01:17:39   | Well, editorial.                                                                                              |
| 01:17:40   | Let's wait for it to update.                                                                                  |
| 01:17:41   | Well, they did update it nine months ago with support for the iPhone X screen resolution,                     |
| 01:17:46   | so that was a good start.                                                                                     |
| 01:17:48   | But like all like so many apps, like Apple's Notes app, like if I just want to pop it open                    |
| 01:17:52   | for a second while I'm like out on the street with my phone, I do have to- I scroll down                      |
| 01:17:57   | a little bit and wait.                                                                                        |
| 01:17:58   | And it's not until I see the top of the page because it reloaded, that's when it got updated                  |
| 01:18:02   | from Dropbox.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:03   | It won't do it on its own.                                                                                    |
| 01:18:05   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:06   | That is most unfortunate.                                                                                     |
| 01:18:08   | I mean, when you look at editorial and Drafts, I feel like [[Drafts]] really is the poster child                  |
| 01:18:13   | for app subscriptions.                                                                                        |
| 01:18:16   | You know, I think the reason editorial didn't continue to get development was there was                       |
| 01:18:21   | no more- you couldn't afford to, you know?                                                                    |
| 01:18:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:24   | I don't know how people survive.                                                                              |
| 01:18:25   | I was on the beta of [[Drafts]] the first day I got it, I subscribed.                                             |
| 01:18:29   | Like with money.                                                                                              |
| 01:18:30   | It's like, please take my money, keep making this, keep making these kinds of things.                         |
| 01:18:34   | Make stuff, please, developers, make stuff like the Hook productivity app.                                    |
| 01:18:38   | Please developers, keep making.                                                                               |
| 01:18:39   | There's somebody, I swear to God, there's somebody out there that will give you money                         |
| 01:18:43   | for your ambition.                                                                                            |
| 01:18:45   | And I'm so grateful those people still exist.                                                                 |
| 01:18:47   | I didn't know you were a hook user, Merlin, but it makes total sense that you are-                            |
| 01:18:52   | Just started.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:53   | Okay.                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:54   | Well, I'm still figuring it out.                                                                              |
| 01:18:55   | We did it for a challenge on Dubai Friday.                                                                    |
| 01:18:57   | And where did I learn about it?                                                                               |
| 01:18:58   | Because they were on the OmniFocus or Omni Group podcast, the dude.                                            |
| 01:19:02   | And I think it's really interesting.                                                                          |
| 01:19:03   | I feel like this weekend is the first time I finally kind of got my head around it.                           |
| 01:19:07   | I still don't know if it's, what's neat about it to me is if I am going to be using                           |
| 01:19:11   | Taskpaper in the Taskpaper app on my Mac, like it's pretty powerful to me the way in                        |
| 01:19:16   | his YouTube video, you might want to put that in notes, in his YouTube video, he basically                    |
| 01:19:20   | explains how you can create these hubs, involves like replicating templates and it could be                   |
| 01:19:25   | this entire world view and his videos go by really fast, but at the heart of it, Hook                         |
| 01:19:30   | is an app that lets you say to, what's the word, to, you hook a thing to another thing                        |
| 01:19:38   | and it's bi-directional.                                                                                      |
| 01:19:40   | So if I'm on a web page, I open this thing up, it's like [[LaunchBar]], it's like [[Alfred]].                         |
| 01:19:44   | Open this thing up and I want you to associate that with this Taskpaper file.                                |
| 01:19:49   | So now, if I ever open that web page again, I'm a keystroke away from seeing all the things                   |
| 01:19:53   | that it's attached to.                                                                                        |
| 01:19:55   | And unlike Devon thinking stuff like that, very powerful, what I love about Hook or what                      |
| 01:20:00   | is interesting to me about Hook, a lot of [[LaunchBar]] is that it exists outside of all                          |
| 01:20:06   | those separate documents, all those separate web pages, small pieces loosely joined.                          |
| 01:20:12   | There's nothing formal, there's not like a big dumb database where I have to put all                          |
| 01:20:16   | these PDFs, you can just open up one file, drag a bunch of stuff into it and then guess                       |
| 01:20:22   | what, those are associated now.                                                                               |
| 01:20:24   | So it's kind of like a, I think he might say, it's like this cognitive CMS for how you work,                  |
| 01:20:30   | but it's extremely lightweight.                                                                               |
| 01:20:31   | Like I say, I don't know if I'm going to be using it five years from now, I kind of doubt                     |
| 01:20:35   | it, but I'm very intrigued by how it works and I love that it exists.                                         |
| 01:20:40   | Well, like thinking about your Taskpaper work that you're doing, you could very easily                       |
| 01:20:46   | using Hook because one of the things Hook does that I'm not aware of any other app doing                      |
| 01:20:50   | is it allows you to create a URL link to a file that's not like DEVONthink will do                           |
| 01:20:55   | it, but I mean, like generally just on your file system, you can create a link to a file.                     |
| 01:21:00   | So you can have a link to the audio file or the outline for the podcast or like in my                         |
| 01:21:05   | case, I use Hook in conjunction with Obsidian and Markdown files when I have a client matter                  |
| 01:21:12   | so I can get to the OmniFocus project, to the client folder, like everything is just                          |
| 01:21:17   | connected.                                                                                                    |
| 01:21:18   | So you're really, wow, that's amazing, you're doing that for your work you work.                              |
| 01:21:23   | That's amazing.                                                                                               |
| 01:21:24   | Yeah, I mean, well, it's faster once you have it and using automation, you can build them                     |
| 01:21:28   | very quickly and when you're working, it makes everything seamless, you know, you use the                     |
| 01:21:35   | word cognitive earlier, I really, as the more I think about this whole thing of computers,                    |
| 01:21:42   | what we need to use automation for is to get from thought to action.                                          |
| 01:21:47   | That's what we're really using automation for, right?                                                         |
| 01:21:50   | One of the things I forget who first said this, whether it was me or Ethan, but back                          |
| 01:21:54   | in the days of Kinkless and then getting into what would become OmniFocus, the phrase that                     |
| 01:22:00   | I found myself using anyway was sort of like decreasing the path from cognition to completion,                |
| 01:22:06   | right?                                                                                                        |
| 01:22:07   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:22:08   | However you want to think about that, but the idea is like, the more that I can remove                        |
| 01:22:11   | barriers, hangups, delays, like you want to get too done, right?                                              |
| 01:22:18   | That's what we're trying to accomplish here.                                                                  |
| 01:22:19   | How do we envision what done looks like and then do everything clear the path to make                         |
| 01:22:23   | that possible?                                                                                                |
| 01:22:24   | And to me, that continues to be something that's a guiding principle for me.                                  |
| 01:22:27   | And you know, it doesn't get you to completion is spending a lot of time, like, you know,                     |
| 01:22:31   | writing scripts for your scripts for your scripts.                                                            |
| 01:22:33   | If that works and it's useful, that's good, but you just got to like, you know, like,                         |
| 01:22:37   | say, stay on target, stay on target, what is it we're trying to finish here?                                  |
| 01:22:40   | I can't go home and make the Legos until I finish doing the show.                                             |
| 01:22:44   | And I can't finish the show until I've split up the files, et cetera, et cetera.                              |
| 01:22:47   | It's like, you reverse engineer, you know, what success looks like and then create the                        |
| 01:22:51   | affordances that make it difficult to fail.                                                                   |
| 01:22:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:22:56   | But in addition to being worried about scripts about scripts, you also have to be worried                     |
| 01:22:59   | about every time I open my email application, I have a risk of being diverted by something                    |
| 01:23:06   | else.                                                                                                         |
| 01:23:07   | Every time I open my browser, they're, you know, a website may pull me away from                              |
| 01:23:10   | staying on target.                                                                                            |
| 01:23:11   | And that's, that's the half of it where the automation makes the difference.                                  |
| 01:23:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:23:16   | But you're also, I agree with you, but, you know, in talking about something that's always                    |
| 01:23:20   | been a little bit of a B in my bonnet is things like New Year's resolutions.                                  |
| 01:23:24   | And you know, what I finally landed on with New Year's resolutions, so I had a series                         |
| 01:23:28   | on 43 folders a million years ago called something like, I forget what it was called, like small              |
| 01:23:33   | starts, modest changes, something like that, but just a way of trying to tweak rather than                    |
| 01:23:36   | think that because the calendar changes, it'll flip.                                                          |
| 01:23:40   | In the time since, I think that I've realised that things like New Year's resolutions often                   |
| 01:23:45   | fail because they lack the most critical part, which is infrastructure.                                       |
| 01:23:50   | Like whenever, whether you're, whether you're like a project manager or a parent or whatever,                 |
| 01:23:54   | like think about, if you want to succeed, yes, think about what success looks like,                           |
| 01:23:58   | for sure.                                                                                                     |
| 01:23:59   | Like, and that success as in like you become a douchebag with a Lamborghini, but as in                        |
| 01:24:02   | like I get to go home and make this Hagrid's hut Lego this afternoon that I'm very excited                    |
| 01:24:06   | to make.                                                                                                      |
| 01:24:07   | Okay.                                                                                                         |
| 01:24:08   | But like, I think what you, what you have to do in some ways is be very deliberate and                        |
| 01:24:13   | focused about figuring out what if, if I know what success looks like or think I do, what's                   |
| 01:24:19   | the fastest way to introduce some infrastructure that keeps me on the rails, right?                           |
| 01:24:24   | So like how come, how come you fail that your annual New Year's resolution to lose weight                     |
| 01:24:31   | and eat better?                                                                                               |
| 01:24:32   | Well, don't have potato chips in the house.                                                                   |
| 01:24:35   | Like pre-make some meals and like put them in little packets, make snacks that you can                        |
| 01:24:40   | grab.                                                                                                         |
| 01:24:41   | Only you know what that infrastructure looks like, but the key thing, and again, this does                    |
| 01:24:44   | get back to where does this belong, the concept, right?                                                       |
| 01:24:47   | But infrastructure means that you, you have thought enough ahead to know that to get to                       |
| 01:24:51   | that success, there's going to have to be a little bit of as you know, as Ethan Schoonover                    |
| 01:24:56   | would say, where what we really care about is the building that we're building, but we                        |
| 01:25:00   | will need a scaffolding to make that building, but we also cannot spend all day thinking                      |
| 01:25:05   | about our scaffolding because building the building is why we have the scaffolding.                           |
| 01:25:08   | The scaffolding is not here to make more scaffolding, but that is critical.                                   |
| 01:25:13   | Infrastructure means you've put the things in place to anticipate where this is likely                        |
| 01:25:17   | to be difficult, where you're going to need extra support.                                                    |
| 01:25:21   | There's not a project I can think of that doesn't benefit from having a little bit of                         |
| 01:25:24   | infrastructure, not all of the infrastructure, not over infrastructure, not over engineered,                  |
| 01:25:29   | but enough to keep you in motion and then you iterate that.                                                   |
| 01:25:32   | Do I need to change the way I'm doing this?                                                                   |
| 01:25:33   | Do I need to change the way that I'm doing infrastructure?                                                    |
| 01:25:36   | That's just such, that's such a critical role to me.                                                          |
| 01:25:39   | And it was Ethan who really to me socialised, at least in our group, that idea, what does                     |
| 01:25:43   | it mean to have infrastructure?                                                                               |
| 01:25:44   | It means I have enough of a scaffolding to make the building.                                                 |
| 01:25:48   | And I think that's, it's, if you succeed with any other means, you got lucky.                                 |
| 01:25:53   | It's, you got real lucky because it worked out.                                                               |
| 01:25:56   | If you have something ambitious you want to do that requires a lot of your, your will,                        |
| 01:26:00   | your time, your, your, your background, your experience, your education.                                      |
| 01:26:04   | You're still going to want to have an infrastructure because life does not always go the way that             |
| 01:26:08   | you anticipated and you're, you're going to want a way to be able to stay, if it's still                      |
| 01:26:13   | valuable to you to do, you're going to need that infrastructure.                                              |
| 01:26:17   | And figuring out how much infrastructure versus how much building that's, that's where, that's                |
| 01:26:22   | the hard part.                                                                                                |
| 01:26:26   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint.                        |
| 01:26:30   | I love finding new podcasts to listen to, it's always something magical when you find                         |
| 01:26:34   | something that just makes your brain tick.                                                                    |
| 01:26:36   | If you're looking for a new show to listen to, the Intrazone is a bi-weekly podcast with                      |
| 01:26:40   | conversations and interviews on how Microsoft SharePoint, OneDrive, and related tech can                      |
| 01:26:45   | work for you.                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:46   | You'll hear from guest experts behind the scenes and out in the field, so you can easily                      |
| 01:26:50   | see how SharePoint fits into your everyday work life to easily share and manage content,                      |
| 01:26:54   | knowledge, and applications.                                                                                  |
| 01:26:56   | Each show covers a bunch of segments, like news and announcements, a focused topic of                         |
| 01:27:00   | the week, guest perspective, FAQs of the week, and upcoming events.                                           |
| 01:27:05   | And just so you have an idea of what to expect, I want to tell you some of the topics you                     |
| 01:27:09   | might be interested in that were on previous episodes.                                                        |
| 01:27:12   | They've discussed working from home, which I know is relevant to a lot of you, and also                       |
| 01:27:16   | figuring out an intelligent intranet in your organisation.                                                    |
| 01:27:19   | Oh, and they did an episode talking about API and teamwork too, which you should give                         |
| 01:27:23   | a try.                                                                                                        |
| 01:27:24   | I really enjoyed the episode on Microsoft To Do, the list management application which                        |
| 01:27:29   | Microsoft created, based on Wunderlist.                                                                       |
| 01:27:31   | And guess what?                                                                                               |
| 01:27:32   | It's really useful.                                                                                           |
| 01:27:34   | We're using this at work for a variety of different things at the moment, and it turns                        |
| 01:27:38   | out my mum's using it in her workplace as well, so I was even able to share that knowledge                    |
| 01:27:42   | with somebody in my family.                                                                                   |
| 01:27:44   | Go and listen to it now.                                                                                      |
| 01:27:46   | Just search for the Intrazone wherever you get your podcasts.                                                 |

| 01:27:55   | Go check it out.                                                                                              |
| 01:27:56   | Our thanks to the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint for their support of this show and                        |
| 01:28:00   | all of Read AFM.                                                                                              |
| 01:28:01   | Marlin, you've been involved with computers and automation for a long time.                                   |
| 01:28:08   | What are the areas that you would like to see improve, or even just areas you're working                      |
| 01:28:14   | on that just aren't there yet, other than HomeKit?                                                            |
| 01:28:21   | That's a really good question.                                                                                |
| 01:28:23   | Of the things that I have any control over, one of the things I've always loved on a Mac,                     |
| 01:28:30   | and this happens other places, but I've been using a Mac pretty much every day since 1987,                    |
| 01:28:35   | and there's one phenomenon of using Apple products in general that never gets old for                         |
| 01:28:40   | me.                                                                                                           |
| 01:28:41   | It doesn't happen every day, but have you ever had- I'm sure you've had this situation                        |
| 01:28:44   | where you say, huh, I wonder what would happen if I click on that, or I wonder what would                     |
| 01:28:48   | happen if I option click on that, and on the one hand, it does exactly what you hoped it                      |
| 01:28:55   | would do.                                                                                                     |
| 01:28:56   | You didn't have to read a manual.                                                                             |
| 01:28:57   | You just sort of intuited that that's the thing that you could do.                                            |
| 01:29:00   | Right now, anybody listening, I know you know all this, but start option clicking on stuff                    |
| 01:29:05   | in your menu bar.                                                                                             |
| 01:29:06   | You might be surprised.                                                                                       |
| 01:29:07   | You'd be amazed how much stuff lives under option clicking, whether that's sound source,                      |
| 01:29:11   | whether that's whatever that is, like there's just little things where you noodle around,                     |
| 01:29:14   | you try something intuitive, but to think about the whoever, whatever group made that                         |
| 01:29:22   | feature work is so freaking smart, and so to make something that I find intuitive, that's                     |
| 01:29:29   | just such a source of delight in my life.                                                                     |
| 01:29:31   | There's all sorts of stuff like this where you learn that there's something you never                         |
| 01:29:34   | realised was as clever as it is, and I love things like that popping up, but if everything                    |
| 01:29:39   | can't be clever, make it clearer.                                                                             |
| 01:29:42   | There's just so many things, and again, another big pattern is like, there's so much stuff                    |
| 01:29:46   | that kind of lacks clarity or lacks thinking all the way through.                                             |
| 01:29:50   | This is the project manager in me is like doing the risk mitigation of figuring out what happens              |
| 01:29:55   | if this fails at this particular point at the state.                                                          |
| 01:29:58   | Some of the frustration with a lot of stuff in work and in automation and computers is                        |
| 01:30:02   | that there's just not clear what you're supposed to do.                                                       |
| 01:30:06   | One thing you hear from developers nowadays.                                                                  |
| 01:30:07   | I don't know if it's true today, but for like two years, I've just been hearing about the                     |
| 01:30:11   | lack of proper documentation for stuff in Swift, stuff in APIs.                                               |
| 01:30:16   | Is it really true?                                                                                            |
| 01:30:18   | That's crazy to me.                                                                                           |
| 01:30:19   | When I go and I'm setting up this Synology, I got pages and pages and pages of extensive                      |
| 01:30:23   | documentation for different situations, and it's all so well thought out, and then it's                       |
| 01:30:29   | just frustrating to me, okay, is there a list?                                                                |
| 01:30:31   | Is there an official list right now of everything that Siri can respond to?                                   |
| 01:30:35   | No.                                                                                                           |
| 01:30:36   | There's articles on iMore, like there's things like that you can find, but I got a HomePod                    |
| 01:30:41   | Mini.                                                                                                         |
| 01:30:42   | I was very happy to have my HomePod Mini arrive.                                                              |
| 01:30:45   | HomePod Mini has some features in common with the regular HomePod and others not.                             |
| 01:30:50   | And okay, so you buy a HomePod, yay HomePod, I want good speaker, okay, well guess what?                      |
| 01:30:56   | If you got the costly HomePod, you can do Atmos 5.1 and 7.1, and you can make that the                        |
| 01:31:03   | permanent source coming out of your TV, you can create a stereo pair, you can do all of                       |
| 01:31:08   | those things.                                                                                                 |
| 01:31:09   | Now that does not have that easy handoff ability that the HomePod Mini has.                                   |
| 01:31:13   | HomePod Mini has a lot to recommend it.                                                                       |
| 01:31:15   | You can do a stereo pair, but guess what?                                                                     |
| 01:31:16   | It doesn't do Atmos, okay, oh, but I can still make that the permanent source coming out                      |
| 01:31:20   | of my Apple TV, no, that's just on the other Apple TV, and it's like, okay, like, I know                      |
| 01:31:26   | all that because I watched Tim get up there and learn what he's excited for me to do something                |
| 01:31:30   | with.                                                                                                         |
| 01:31:31   | And it's crazy making to me how much inconsistency there is between different things, like, make              |
| 01:31:37   | sure you buy this right thing in this configuration, there's not clarity to all of these things.              |
| 01:31:43   | What we sacrifice for the simplicity of an Apple presentation is that sometimes has wrought                   |
| 01:31:49   | extreme confusion in like, how do I actually, how do I deal with this thing if it doesn't                     |
| 01:31:55   | work?                                                                                                         |
| 01:31:56   | Oh, I mean, I guess you take it in, you can't put RAM in there, you can't open it up, you                     |
| 01:32:00   | can't do those things.                                                                                        |
| 01:32:01   | You can, you can go look at Reddit, there's just, there's so much stuff where it's frustrating                |
| 01:32:05   | to me that like, like I said at the top, it's frustrating to me when you take away the power                  |
| 01:32:11   | to provide a little bit of simplicity, but it's not really that simple and it's not really                    |
| 01:32:15   | that powerful.                                                                                                |
| 01:32:16   | Like with hoops, for example, I believe that I could sit down and learn that the same way                     |
| 01:32:22   | I learned my 3D printer, the same way I learned PHP, like I can learn enough to get through                   |
| 01:32:26   | these things, given the right amount of motivation and documentation.                                         |
| 01:32:31   | Just one of the hangups for me though with this stuff is that when stuff doesn't work,                        |
| 01:32:35   | I'm not sure who it's for, like if this was for a developer, I could guess, see that?                         |
| 01:32:42   | Is this for the notional aunt or uncle?                                                                       |
| 01:32:44   | Oh boy, you're really going to want some help with that.                                                      |
| 01:32:47   | That's where it gets frustrating to me.                                                                       |
| 01:32:48   | This stuff wants to make our life better and then like, but there are downsides and consequences              |
| 01:32:54   | to getting this stuff wrong, whether that's a money thing or a time thing, or often enough                    |
| 01:32:58   | a security thing, that was really rambly, but that's one of the things right now.                             |
| 01:33:04   | I feel like there's so many ways in which we're in this transitional period, whether                          |
| 01:33:07   | it's with our government and our culture or with the technology where it's like on the                        |
| 01:33:11   | one hand, it's never felt more powerful, but it's also never felt more perilous that there                    |
| 01:33:15   | are risks to getting this stuff wrong, getting the wrong camera in the wrong place with the                   |
| 01:33:20   | wrong setting with poor geolocation has consequences.                                                         |
| 01:33:25   | There was the thing I just saw today and I didn't read the whole article, but apparently                      |
| 01:33:28   | you just see the thing about the at home hubs or routers is a new kind of like an Amazon                      |
| 01:33:33   | only router has like a built in backdoor that's not been announced, stuff like that.                          |
| 01:33:39   | There's consequences to getting this stuff wrong and that that makes us, I think a little                     |
| 01:33:43   | timid about whether it's safe to go all in.                                                                   |
| 01:33:46   | Do you trust the folks who are making that on any number of levels that you'll be cared                       |
| 01:33:51   | for, you know, and that you'll, I don't know.                                                                 |
| 01:33:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:33:54   | What do you think?                                                                                            |
| 01:33:55   | That's a lot, but I think it is a lot.                                                                        |
| 01:33:58   | I'm sorry.                                                                                                    |
| 01:33:59   | I've been recording podcasts all day and I'm hungry and I'm losing my mind.                                   |
| 01:34:02   | So I'm probably losing the thread a little bit.                                                               |
| 01:34:04   | No, I mean, I think that you're, I'm with you though.                                                         |
| 01:34:07   | I feel like, for instance, getting to the security thing, the reason why I buy Apple                          |
| 01:34:12   | stuff, the reason why I was whining earlier that I want Apple to make a more expensive                        |
| 01:34:16   | light bulb is because I don't want to think about that stuff.                                                 |
| 01:34:20   | And I do believe that Apple is a company that is privacy minded.                                              |
| 01:34:24   | I mean, they don't make their money by selling advertising.                                                   |
| 01:34:29   | So they don't have the same motivations that tech companies do.                                               |
| 01:34:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:34:35   | Let me give you, let me give you just a kind of quick-ish example.                                            |
| 01:34:40   | There are lots of options out there for hard drives and NAS products, but I've been really                    |
| 01:34:44   | satisfied with Synology's.                                                                                    |
| 01:34:46   | After the, I made an initial mistake, which is the first Synology I bought, I cheaped                         |
| 01:34:49   | out and I bought a Tube A Synology, which is really stupid.                                                   |
| 01:34:53   | It kind of defeats the purpose.                                                                               |
| 01:34:56   | But you know, now I've got a six bay that I use at the office and I got this four bay                         |
| 01:34:59   | for at home.                                                                                                  |
| 01:35:00   | And it's really, it's a really neat device that is like mostly surprisingly intuitive.                        |
| 01:35:05   | Once you get your head around using their weird like kind of web app, I think it's really                     |
| 01:35:09   | powerful.                                                                                                     |
| 01:35:10   | But like, just here's an example that I've run into for the second time now in about                          |
| 01:35:14   | a month, which is part of the beauty of the Synology.                                                         |
| 01:35:18   | And the whole point of this anecdote is that it's nobody in particular's fault.                               |
| 01:35:22   | And yet something's not working, right?                                                                       |
| 01:35:24   | So you buy this thing, it's basically a bunch of hard drives that are striped together.                       |
| 01:35:28   | So you ever done and see, you know, it's pretty reliable.                                                     |
| 01:35:31   | And then you get a pretty nice computer with it, really.                                                      |
| 01:35:34   | I mean, there's all these guts that kind of run around the hard drive.                                        |
| 01:35:37   | And that lets you do stuff like stream media.                                                                 |
| 01:35:39   | Like you can do time machine backups, there's so much you can do that's basically, it doesn't                 |
| 01:35:44   | look like a computer, but it's a little box full of hard drives that you can use to run                       |
| 01:35:48   | your business.                                                                                                |
| 01:35:49   | It's brilliant.                                                                                               |
| 01:35:50   | And one of the benefits that is really cool about Synology, you plug it in, you get it                        |
| 01:35:54   | on your network, and with an absolute minimum of fiddling, it should be able to hook up                       |
| 01:35:59   | fine with your router, which it mostly does.                                                                  |
| 01:36:02   | You bring it up, it even has a cool app.                                                                      |
| 01:36:03   | You run an app on your Mac and it says, hey, are there any Synology's around here?                            |
| 01:36:06   | It goes, hey, here's your Synology.                                                                           |
| 01:36:07   | Do you want to set that up?                                                                                   |
| 01:36:08   | And you're like, yes.                                                                                         |
| 01:36:09   | Yes, I want to set this up.                                                                                   |
| 01:36:10   | You go in, you set it up, you put the criteria in.                                                            |
| 01:36:13   | You can even set up DDNS.                                                                                     |
| 01:36:14   | So now you can get to that remotely and securely.                                                             |
| 01:36:16   | One of the hallmark features though, in some ways, is all these apps you can run, productivity                |
| 01:36:22   | apps.                                                                                                         |
| 01:36:23   | Replacements for Dropbox, replacements for G Suite, maybe not as good, but like a video                       |
| 01:36:28   | serving system that you could like look at videos on your Apple TV, even if you're not                        |
| 01:36:32   | a Plex user.                                                                                                  |
| 01:36:33   | But of course, yes, it has Plex.                                                                              |
| 01:36:34   | It's got all of the things.                                                                                   |
| 01:36:36   | Each one of those things needs to open up a port.                                                             |
| 01:36:41   | And as you all know, you want to be careful with your ports.                                                  |
| 01:36:43   | You don't want to f around with 22 if you don't know what you're doing, right?                                |
| 01:36:46   | And so there's ports, and the ports are what enable it to communicate between these devices.                  |
| 01:36:52   | Then of course, on top of that, you've got a firewall where you say, yeah, I want Apple                       |
| 01:36:56   | File Protocol or SMB to work here, but I don't want it to work there.                                         |
| 01:36:59   | I don't want everybody to be able to come in and run our thing.                                               |
| 01:37:02   | Now here's the beauty part on the label anyway.                                                               |
| 01:37:05   | You fire up your Synology, hook it up to your router, and I happen to have a router that                      |
| 01:37:12   | says very prominently, this is a UPNP device, which some nerds don't love because it's maybe                  |
| 01:37:18   | not the most secure.                                                                                          |
| 01:37:19   | Guess what?                                                                                                   |
| 01:37:20   | My router is a UPNP, like a plug and play device, and my Synology is a UPNP device.                           |
| 01:37:26   | Perfect, right?                                                                                               |
| 01:37:28   | You hook them up, you plug them in, it does the little secret handshake.                                      |
| 01:37:32   | And from now on, when I add or remove an app functionality from Synology, the router will                     |
| 01:37:38   | be able to talk to the Synology and know what ports to do what with, which is great.                          |
| 01:37:44   | The problem is it doesn't work.                                                                               |
| 01:37:46   | The problem is that when you hook it up and you run it against your router, the final                         |
| 01:37:50   | test fails and it says, this is not a UPNP router.                                                            |
| 01:37:53   | Okay, whatever.                                                                                               |
| 01:37:54   | The problem is now, now if I do, I want to go in and manually open all of those ports                         |
| 01:37:59   | and second, do I want to go in and manually create firewall rules?                                            |
| 01:38:03   | You know, they got a security thing that'll check for problems and stuff like that.                           |
| 01:38:07   | No, but ideally, I want my UPNP router to talk to my UPNP Synology, right?                                    |
| 01:38:11   | Yep.                                                                                                          |
| 01:38:12   | So I go to the router support and it's like, yeah, everything seems fine.                                     |
| 01:38:15   | UPNP, that's what it should be doing.                                                                         |
| 01:38:17   | Sorry, I can't help you.                                                                                      |
| 01:38:18   | Go to Synology, it goes, yeah, UPNP should work fine.                                                         |
| 01:38:22   | There's no Sherpa in between.                                                                                 |
| 01:38:23   | There's no rabbi in between.                                                                                  |
| 01:38:25   | There's no [[Brett Terpstra]] in between to hold my hand and help me figure out what's wrong.                     |
| 01:38:29   | So what do I do?                                                                                              |
| 01:38:30   | Do I go in and start opening ports, creating firewall rules?                                                  |
| 01:38:33   | Here to tell you, bud, it's really easy to screw that up in a way that has consequences.                      |
| 01:38:39   | That space, that liminal space between the two things that should work together, as long                      |
| 01:38:44   | as that rant was, that's the definition of frustration for me, is it's nobody's fault.                        |
| 01:38:50   | It really is nobody's fault.                                                                                  |
| 01:38:51   | There's probably something in how they're not working together.                                               |
| 01:38:54   | It's getting to the internet.                                                                                 |
| 01:38:55   | It's assigning DHCP addresses.                                                                                |
| 01:38:57   | It worked with DDNS.                                                                                          |
| 01:38:59   | It's done all of those things, but I test it over and over and I get to that last step                        |
| 01:39:03   | and then it says, nope, you got to set this up manually, and that's crazy making to me.                       |
| 01:39:08   | Like I say, it just happened for the second time in a month, and I just got to get through                    |
| 01:39:14   | it again, but there are risks to getting it wrong.                                                            |
| 01:39:18   | At least time is one of them.                                                                                 |
| 01:39:20   | Money is one of them, but security is another one of them.                                                    |
| 01:39:23   | Functionality, whether it's to do the thing it's supposed to do, well, do I need to go                        |
| 01:39:26   | get the iDevices app in order to be able to go in and do the functionality, do I use                          |
| 01:39:30   | Home+ for that, like try explaining that to somebody over the phone, like it's stuff                       |
| 01:39:36   | is complicated and it's frustrating, that's all.                                                              |
| 01:39:38   | And the worst part of it is, is when these things are actually working, my Plex server                        |
| 01:39:42   | currently tells me that it's not available outside of my network.                                             |
| 01:39:45   | However, I literally have a friend streaming for my Plex machine right now.                                   |
| 01:39:50   | She's watching Futurama.                                                                                      |
| 01:39:51   | It's working for somebody.                                                                                    |
| 01:39:53   | Yeah, she's watching Futurama.                                                                                |
| 01:39:54   | It's fine.                                                                                                    |
| 01:39:55   | It's all good, but my Plex server says, oh, no, but somebody can't get to it.                                 |
| 01:40:00   | Oh, Rose, Rose, welcome to welcome to my life with a new Mac mini using screens and like                      |
| 01:40:05   | it's getting, I've got screens running on three Macs and then of course on the iOS devices                    |
| 01:40:09   | to get to them.                                                                                               |
| 01:40:11   | And some things work in some places, some things don't work in other places, some things                      |
| 01:40:14   | work under certain conditions, but not others.                                                                |
| 01:40:16   | If I'm in the room with the device on the same network, generally no problem.                                 |
| 01:40:21   | I test it out by turning off Wi-Fi and using my iOS device.                                                   |
| 01:40:24   | That seems to be fine.                                                                                        |
| 01:40:25   | I go to the office, I bring it up, the whole goal is for me to bring up that screen on                        |
| 01:40:29   | my office computer and get to my home computer from there.                                                    |
| 01:40:32   | Not going to happen.                                                                                          |
| 01:40:33   | Try it three different ways.                                                                                  |
| 01:40:34   | Try saving it three different ways and screen connect.                                                        |
| 01:40:37   | Oh, by the way, the new Mac does not show up in screen connect.                                               |
| 01:40:40   | I tried logging out and re-logging into everything.                                                           |
| 01:40:43   | It's nobody's fault, but it still doesn't work.                                                               |
| 01:40:46   | And like that's a lot of dough to like not be able to do the thing.                                           |
| 01:40:50   | And it's, how do you, how do you even track that down?                                                        |
| 01:40:53   | I mean, I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 01:40:55   | I can't recreate every condition all day long to try and test all this stuff out.                             |
| 01:40:59   | So I end up spending half an hour here, half an hour there, and then now you get this costly                  |
| 01:41:03   | device.                                                                                                       |
| 01:41:04   | It's just not doing the thing, but it's nobody's fault.                                                       |
| 01:41:06   | And your light's still coming on at three o'clock in the morning because that's what                          |
| 01:41:09   | they decided to do.                                                                                           |
| 01:41:10   | Your lonely robot is stuck in some Cormac McCarthy novel wandering, wandering down the road with              |
| 01:41:16   | a grocery cart.                                                                                               |
| 01:41:17   | Quite a scene.                                                                                                |
| 01:41:18   | Well, as long as the room but didn't escape to the beach, we're all good.                                     |
| 01:41:22   | Apparently, they're not good on sand.                                                                         |
| 01:41:24   | Oh no, I can't imagine.                                                                                       |
| 01:41:27   | That's probably enough, huh?                                                                                  |
| 01:41:29   | Yeah, Merlin, thanks so much.                                                                                 |
| 01:41:31   | You need more small and large, you need more small and large on it.                                           |
| 01:41:33   | You know what it is?                                                                                          |
| 01:41:34   | I'm gonna tell you this.                                                                                      |
| 01:41:35   | I'm telling you, Alexa routines, Alexa routines are, sorry, Alexa stuff, Alexa, lady in the                   |
| 01:41:44   | tube routines, you know, rule everything around me.                                                           |
| 01:41:48   | Yeah.                                                                                                         |
| 01:41:49   | Love it.                                                                                                      |
| 01:41:50   | Anyway, cut that out.                                                                                         |
| 01:41:51   | Delirious.                                                                                                    |
| 01:41:52   | We'll let you go eat then, Merlin.                                                                            |
| 01:41:55   | Yeah, I do appreciate you coming in, talking some automation with us.                                         |
| 01:41:59   | It's always great talking to you.                                                                             |
| 01:42:01   | I still have to listen to last week's episode because just the show notes alone are very                      |
| 01:42:06   | stimulating.                                                                                                  |
| 01:42:07   | I'm super interested to hear.                                                                                 |
| 01:42:09   | So that would be from your Automated Podcast, number 63, home automation, wizardry and nerd                   |
| 01:42:13   | out.                                                                                                          |
| 01:42:14   | Oh my God.                                                                                                    |
| 01:42:15   | I can't believe I haven't heard this yet.                                                                     |
| 01:42:16   | It's in my overcast, but I have not listened to it yet.                                                       |
| 01:42:19   | Well, see, this is the thing.                                                                                 |
| 01:42:20   | Rose lives alone.                                                                                             |
| 01:42:21   | So she doesn't have to worry about getting divorced over the lights going on at 3 a.m.                        |
| 01:42:26   | Wow.                                                                                                          |
| 01:42:27   | Super.                                                                                                        |
| 01:42:28   | So she has automation that we can only, you know, wish for.                                                   |
| 01:42:33   | Oh man, I'm going to learn so much from this.                                                                 |
| 01:42:36   | Thank you guys.                                                                                               |
| 01:42:37   | Thank you both so much for having me and for doing what you do.                                               |
| 01:42:40   | You know, you're the Sherpas.                                                                                 |
| 01:42:42   | It's nobody's fault, but you're the Sherpas.                                                                  |
| 01:42:44   | All right.                                                                                                    |
| 01:42:45   | Well, as long as somebody can stick something together with duct tape or in my case, I used                   |

| 01:42:55   | Thank you very much.                                                                                          |
| 01:42:56   | All right.                                                                                                    |
| 01:42:57   | Folks, Merlin, where should people go if they want to hear more of what you're doing?                         |
| 01:43:02   | Let's see.                                                                                                    |
| 01:43:03   | You know, folks who listen to this show, this is on Relay, right?                                             |
| 01:43:06   | You might enjoy the show that I do with my worst friend, [[John Siracusa]].                                       |
| 01:43:09   | It's called [[Reconcilable Differences]] and we do it every couple of weeks on Relay.                             |
| 01:43:12   | It's relay.fm.rd.                                                                                             |
| 01:43:13   | I do other things too, but please don't bother.                                                               |
| 01:43:15   | Don't find me on the internet.                                                                                |
| 01:43:16   | But [[John Siracusa]], everybody likes him better.                                                                |
| 01:43:18   | He's got all those flying monkeys that are always defending him.                                              |
| 01:43:21   | Well, and we have had the [[Do By Friday]] run here.                                                              |
| 01:43:24   | We had Alex on as our last guy.                                                                               |
| 01:43:26   | All right.                                                                                                    |
| 01:43:27   | That's a fun show.                                                                                            |
| 01:43:28   | I love them.                                                                                                  |
| 01:43:31   | Alex is such a good friend.                                                                                   |
| 01:43:32   | But you know, everybody, you know, just, you know, let's be nice to each other.                               |
| 01:43:37   | Let's get some automation, but you know, Reconcilable Differences, God, I'm tired.                            |
| 01:43:42   | All right.                                                                                                    |
| 01:43:43   | Oh my God.                                                                                                    |
| 01:43:44   | I got to go build a Hagrid.                                                                                   |
| 01:43:45   | Thank you very much for having me.                                                                            |

| 01:43:49   | And it's got a, it's got a buck beak and oh boy, it's really good.                                            |
| 01:43:52   | We made a biplane yesterday and now we're going to move on to Hagrid.                                         |
| 01:43:56   | Excellent.                                                                                                    |

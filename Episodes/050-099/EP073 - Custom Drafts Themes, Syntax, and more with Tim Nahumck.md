| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and as always, I'm joined             |
| 00:06      | by fellow automation nerd David Sparks, and we're going to talk about automating things              |
| 00:11      | and making computers do stuff for us. Hey, David, how are you today?                                 |
| 00:15      | I'm great, Rose. I want to make my computer do stuff, so I think we should talk about                |
| 00:21      | automation today.                                                                                    |
| 00:22      | Yeah. It seems like a novel concept on a show called Automators, but I've heard that some            |
| 00:28      | pretty cool apps out there are doing some pretty cool things, and then I ran into this               |
| 00:32      | guy, Tim, who's just been doing amazing things with [[Drafts]] again, so I asked him on the show.        |
| 00:37      | Is that okay with you?                                                                               |
| 00:38      | Yeah. Let's have Tim on.                                                                             |
| 00:40      | Hey, Tim. Welcome back to the show.                                                                  |
| 00:42      | Hey, everybody. Thanks for having me back.                                                           |
| 00:47      | Well, you're very welcome.                                                                           |
| 00:50      | Tim is the master of [[Drafts]], a frequent author on various bits and pieces of [[Drafts]], and             |
| 00:57      | really is funny. [[Drafts]] is an automation platform. Historically, you don't think of a text editor    |
| 01:03      | as an automation platform, but with all the work Greg has done over the years, that's                |
| 01:08      | what it's become.                                                                                    |
| 01:10      | Oh, yeah. Absolutely. It's one of those things that I find myself just using little things           |
| 01:16      | here and there, and it actually takes me a little while to remember, oh, yeah, that's                |
| 01:22      | an automation. It's just become everyday workflow now.                                               |
| 01:26      | Yeah. We've got a future Mac Power users episode coming out on the joy of [[Obsidian]] and kind          |
| 01:32      | of a deep dive into it, and one of the points I made was that [[Drafts]] is a companion app              |
| 01:37      | to [[Obsidian]], and [[Obsidian]] falls down as an electron app. [[Drafts]] picks up the slack as                |
| 01:44      | a native app, and it's the perfect place to write text and put it in there because whatever          |
| 01:48      | action you need, either already exists or you can build it yourself.                                 |
| 01:53      | And I think one of the things you were saying there, Tim, about automation really is the             |
| 01:57      | point. It should just be part of your workflow. We shouldn't necessarily be thinking about           |
| 02:01      | what we're doing. We should just hit the button and the magic happens, and we continue without       |
| 02:06      | a second thought because really, that is the whole point of this, isn't it, to improve               |
| 02:11      | our workflows. So I'm glad to hear that you've been continuing with that.                            |
| 02:14      | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                    |
| 02:16      | We had Tim on before, and so this is our second kind of [[Drafts]] deep dive with Tim, but in            |
| 02:23      | the interim, [[Drafts]] has changed quite a bit, and they've added a bunch of new features.              |
| 02:26      | So we thought who would be better than to have Tim on to kind of help us walk through                |
| 02:31      | what's new, and there is quite a bit new. And how can we take the most advantage of                  |
| 02:37      | it as automators? So we really appreciate that, Tim.                                                 |
| 02:41      | Yeah, no problem, anytime. Anytime.                                                                  |
| 02:43      | Yeah, we're on [[Drafts]] version 26 now. I can't remember which version number we were on when          |
| 02:50      | we spoke to you, but I'm pretty certain it was in the single digits, because [[Drafts]] 4                |
| 02:53      | was around for a very long time, and then [[Drafts]] 5 came, and then everything just sort               |
| 02:58      | of rollercoastered, I think is the right word to say. Greg, Greg Pierce at Agile Tortoise            |
| 03:03      | has been doing a tremendous job, and I see you all the time in the Drafts [[Slack]] posting               |
| 03:09      | about things, and I always end up checking them out and just being amazed because you                |
| 03:14      | are doing all of these great things, and it's just hard to cover in a couple of words what           |
| 03:20      | exactly it is that you've done, because you seem to do so many things.                               |
| 03:24      | Well, thank you, first of all. But yeah, there's a lot of iterations that have come since 5.         |
| 03:32      | I think that was the last time I was on, was soon after 5 or 5.4 came out, and then it's             |
| 03:39      | changed to just basically version numbers at this point, so we're up to 26, and it's                 |
| 03:45      | one of these examples of a really good subscription app that gives you the benefits for paying       |
| 03:52      | into that over time, and just frequent updates and really solid updates at that.                     |
| 03:56      | Yeah, I was going to say, I think it's like the poster child of subscription apps, because           |
| 04:01      | the worry you have, the implicit promise of a subscription is that I'm going to give you             |
| 04:07      | money on a regular basis, and you're going to give me improved features on a regular                 |
| 04:11      | basis. We've gone from version 5 to 26, and there are a lot of new features that Greg                |
| 04:19      | has just really put the pedal down on. When he came on our show, we talked about iCloud              |
| 04:24      | tags. He had it in there in a month, just like he's constantly making this app better,               |
| 04:31      | which is why I think for me, I just don't find myself very attracted to other text apps,             |
| 04:38      | because whatever feature I want, he's probably already put it in or about to, and then you           |
| 04:43      | combine that with these actions. [[Drafts]] has the ability to write custom user actions,                |
| 04:50      | which can be very simple or very difficult, depending on how far you want to go down that            |
| 04:54      | rabbit hole. Even just a template text is something anybody can do, and I think that                 |
| 05:01      | one of the things I hope people get listening to this today is that you can build your own           |
| 05:05      | actions as well. Yeah, and I think with one of the things                                            |
| 05:09      | with the newest update in 26 that is really going to start coming probably not immediately           |
| 05:16      | right now, but probably in the months to come, as more and more people figure it out, figure         |
| 05:21      | out use cases, is that with customisable themes and syntaxes, you can create little mini apps.       |
| 05:29      | Back when I first wrote about [[Drafts]] 5, it really was one of those things that you could             |
| 05:33      | create little modular apps. If I wanted a writing app, I was there. If I want a journal              |
| 05:37      | app, I'm there. If I want a scratch pad, I'm there, and it's just either a key press or              |
| 05:42      | a swipe away, but now you can have visually different apps within [[Drafts]], and it's going             |
| 05:50      | to really start to take off, and there's some interesting possibilities, I think, ahead.             |
| 05:55      | Yeah. All right, let's take a minute and talk about this new custom themes and [[Drafts]]                |
| 06:01      | and how it works. Give us an overview. The themes and syntaxes, so we'll break it                    |
| 06:06      | down, I guess, into the two. Themes are really just what they are. Any app comes with, well,         |
| 06:13      | most apps come with some sort of light and dark theme, and [[Drafts]] allows you to set that,            |
| 06:19      | but now you can create your own. Do you have a website that you like the colours of? Well,            |
| 06:24      | you can use that in your theme. Do you just like a certain colour palette? You can do that            |
| 06:28      | too. It's really just a fresh coat of paint, and I've often, sometimes, we're sitting out            |
| 06:36      | there looking for the latest, greatest apps coming, and sometimes the developer just throws          |
| 06:42      | a new coat of paint on something, and everybody loves it. I remember when things three brought       |
| 06:47      | out the dark mode, and everybody was super excited about the dark mode, and it's just                |
| 06:53      | one of those things. Little coat of paint, no functionality change, but a little coat                |
| 06:56      | of paint goes a long way. But the difference here is that you can create a theme that really         |
| 07:05      | dials in exactly how you want to work and see a certain draft. So for those that follow              |
| 07:14      | my site, I have a couple of themes based on a light version and a dark version of my site,           |
| 07:19      | and that's kind of where I started, was I wanted a theme that matched my website so                  |
| 07:23      | that when I write, I'm writing for my website, and that's the theme that I use on a regular          |
| 07:28      | basis. Themes in general are just JSON files, that's the nerdy part, but it's not that hard          |
| 07:37      | to create them, really.                                                                              |
| 07:39      | And just kind of for folks that don't want to create them, if you go into the [[Drafts]]                 |
| 07:44      | app, there's already a bunch shipping in the app, and there are also user supplied ones              |
| 07:51      | that you can download from within the app. And I really feel like, like you said, over               |
| 07:56      | the next couple of months, this is probably going to blow up. I mean, it's only a question           |
| 08:00      | of time before we have the solarised view and the different kind of theme views. Maybe               |
| 08:07      | we get the green text on black background or whatever. All the usual nerd go-tos are                 |
| 08:14      | going to be there. And I do think there's something to be said for that, because when                |
| 08:19      | you're working on text, if nothing else, it can bring context to it. You can have different          |
| 08:23      | views for different types of writing, and it's going to be really great as this thing                |
| 08:30      | starts to get bigger.                                                                                |
| 08:31      | Right. And I mean, that's the thing that we do now today with apps. If I'm in [[Drafts]]                 |
| 08:39      | and then I want to use something like Ulysses for writing, those are going to be two different       |
| 08:42      | interface colours, right? It's a visual distinction. I may want to use, you know, a certain monospace |
| 08:49      | font for my writing and regular fonts for just simple scratchpad note-taking. And I can              |
| 08:55      | have that within one app. I don't need to switch. And that's always been my thing.                   |
| 08:59      | It's kind of similar to what you said, David, is that I get so much value out of [[Drafts]].             |
| 09:03      | It really does replace a lot of apps for me, so I don't need to go anywhere else but the             |
| 09:07      | one place. And now I can really customise everything down to little tiny bits of text                |
| 09:14      | for colours just to make sure it pops and I see it in my own way for me.                              |
| 09:20      | So how do you create the JSON file to make your own custom template?                                 |
| 09:25      | Well, so I've started using the app [[Jayson]] by [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]]. I don't know how to pronounce his                 |
| 09:32      | last name.                                                                                           |
| 09:33      | I think it's so nice to pronounce [[Simon Støvring\|Støvring]].                                                          |
| 09:35      | Okay, we'll go with that because you're probably better with names than I am. And I've used          |
| 09:41      | that and I used an app called [[Pastel]]. And that one allows you to choose a colour palette.             |
| 09:49      | So I actually spent some time with the JSON file looking at what things I could customise,           |
| 09:53      | what colours I could change. And then just kind of chose different colours that fit the                |
| 09:59      | theme of my website. So I obviously have a certain colour, the dragon fruit type colour                |
| 10:06      | that is for my site. And then I wanted to accent that with other colours. It took a little            |
| 10:13      | while to get that nailed down and the biggest single complaint of the release. And I mentioned       |
| 10:19      | it to Greg before it went out and I just said, you know, I'm going to write about this too.          |
| 10:24      | But I wish this was either built in or there's some web interface or whatever. Like, I would         |
| 10:30      | love to have one because I think so many users want to just change the look and that's all           |
| 10:36      | they care about that there needs to be an easier visual way. Well, coming out soon, I don't          |
| 10:43      | know if it'll be out by the time this goes out or not. But coming out soon, there's going            |
| 10:47      | to be an online theme builder that does the same thing to be able to choose colours. And              |
| 10:52      | you can build it online, import it and then go and share it from there.                              |
| 10:56      | Yeah, this is something I that's where I really dug into it because I played with it a little        |
| 11:01      | bit in the beta. But I mean, I lack a lot of free time right now. I've had a lot of                  |
| 11:06      | things going on. And so when the theme builder came, I was there go, Oh, okay, this is much,         |
| 11:11      | much easier for me. Because, you know, I can just drag and drop in the bits that I want.             |
| 11:16      | Well, it's not quite drag and drop its type. But that's fine. And then boom, it works.               |
| 11:21      | And so I was obviously incredibly grateful that because you shared your themes with me               |
| 11:24      | Tim, really early on, and I've actually just set those as my default themes. And I want              |
| 11:29      | to talk a little bit about how you're switching between themes in a minute. So don't let me          |
| 11:32      | forget that. But I really like how Greg's made it easy here because I mean, obviously,               |
| 11:40      | you know, he writes iOS and Mac apps, that's his thing, but he's written a great web app             |
| 11:44      | here as well, that just, you know, lets you do this because I love the fact that it's                |
| 11:49      | split as well with the editor and the interface, because you can really change the colour of          |
| 11:54      | I think everything. I don't think there's anything that you can't change the colour of                |
| 11:58      | in [[Drafts]] now with the new theming.                                                                  |
| 12:00      | Right. And those, and those are the basic colours. And then, and then within that whole               |
| 12:05      | big, you know, theme builder or the JSON file, there's these things called scopes. And it's          |
| 12:10      | just the, the different text elements within the app that you can change. And you can customise      |
| 12:15      | those too. It may not work with every syntax, and you may have some weirdness going forward.         |
| 12:22      | But what I've tried to do is, is modify just the key scopes that I want. And then anytime            |
| 12:29      | you create a syntax file that uses those scopes to apply the colours and the theme. So if you         |
| 12:34      | think of it that way, where the theme kind of the theme file sets the colours and what                |
| 12:41      | happens with the text, and then the syntax file really just applies those scopes within              |
| 12:48      | itself. So that way you can have the different elements. So, but yeah, theme, theming is             |
| 12:54      | going to be huge. And I think we could maybe talk about, you know, some automation stuff             |
| 12:59      | going forward in a bit after we talk about syntaxes. But I like what has gone on here.               |
| 13:07      | And it gives everyone a lot of control. And the biggest thing I find with theming that's             |
| 13:13      | been the hardest to get my head around is what looks good, right? And I'm no longer                  |
| 13:19      | sitting going, what's possible? It's like, wow, I mean, what shade of blue represents                |
| 13:24      | what I want here? What shade of orange is the right orange? How does this colour text                 |
| 13:29      | look on this colour background? It really is more about a personal preference selection               |
| 13:37      | than anything else.                                                                                  |
| 13:38      | Yeah, it's like we suddenly have this abundance of riches. And you've got, you've got some           |
| 13:45      | really nice classy looking themes. And you've got some that are just, you know, kids playing         |
| 13:50      | with matches, you know, just terrible. Yeah.                                                         |
| 13:54      | There was a guy in the forum, not the forum, but the [[Slack]] channel. And I think his handle           |
| 14:01      | in there is Kimono Stereo. So I don't know his name. Sorry, I apologise for that. But                |
| 14:07      | he had a bunch of themes when this all came out. And one of them that he put out was called          |
| 14:12      | BSOD, Blue Screen of Death. And I'm like, nope, not installing that, that brings back                |
| 14:18      | too many memories, not happening. But I mean, you could make it like you're typing into              |
| 14:22      | a blue screen of death if you really wanted to go that way. So yeah, it's just crazy the             |
| 14:29      | amount of stuff that you can do and how each theme can really make it feel like a different          |
| 14:34      | space that you're working in.                                                                        |
| 14:35      | Yeah. And all you do to run them as you go into the settings and into preferences. And               |
| 14:41      | by the way, I had said that within a month, they'll be polarised. And now there's already            |
| 14:45      | two polarised in there, dark and light.                                                              |
| 14:47      | I think those might be default themes, David, actually.                                              |
| 14:50      | Yeah, they're built in.                                                                              |
| 14:51      | Yeah, I know.                                                                                        |
| 14:52      | I was gonna say, I was using Solarise Dark as my light theme for a very long time on                 |
| 14:56      | my iPad.                                                                                             |
| 14:57      | Well, and the cool thing about this, and especially with a theme builder, so actually in your        |
| 15:04      | editor settings, which is the little AA icon in the bottom, you can tap that and then you            |
| 15:11      | can actually export this syntax. You don't even need to have JSON or anything like that              |
| 15:15      | installed. What you can do now is with this online theme builder is you can import that              |
| 15:22      | file. And if you don't like a certain colour that's in there, or you wish a colour was something       |
| 15:27      | different, you can change that colour, you can kind of hunt around, play with the settings            |
| 15:32      | a little bit, find that colour, change it, import that again, as your own theme. And                  |
| 15:39      | then you can share that on the directory. It's it's really easy. And in fact, for my                 |
| 15:44      | own themes, as I've been kind of tweaking some things based on either feedback or my                 |
| 15:48      | own personal uses, I've gone in and instead of using JSON to actually modify the file                |
| 15:56      | and type in everything, I've actually gone to the theme builder, uploaded the file, and              |
| 16:02      | then import the new file, overwrite the directory. So I have the saved copy still. And I don't       |
| 16:09      | need to do much else. It's it I can do it all with the online tool. And it's it's actually           |
| 16:15      | sped up my workflow a little bit. It's not automated, but it works.                                  |
| 16:20      | So what are your your in addition to your own themes? Are there any that you would recommend?        |
| 16:25      | There's a there's a few. So the things that I'm using different themes for right now.                |
| 16:31      | Obviously, I have my own dark theme that I use on a regular basis for either writing                 |
| 16:37      | or work for right now, which I'll talk about maybe in a minute. Journaling, I have my own            |
| 16:44      | journal dark theme. Jeff Perry of tablet habit had come up with his and I kind of morphed            |
| 16:51      | it into my own. So I liked the colour theme that he had there. So that one's a good one.              |
| 16:57      | I think that one's called tablet habit dark. Once I get to a certain place for task management,      |
| 17:05      | I'm going to probably use either the dark and friendly theme that was provided by Matt               |
| 17:11      | Birchler. It's either I'll use that or I'll I'll I'll change and modify it and credit                |
| 17:16      | him in the in there for task management. I'll do that. And then for scripting, I use a theme         |
| 17:24      | in there called night owl. It's a it's a theme that's been around for a long time in some            |
| 17:29      | other writing apps and coding apps. My buddy Jeff Mueller had gone and actually taken that           |
| 17:36      | theme went through painstakingly before the online theme builder and set all the colours.             |
| 17:41      | It took him about probably half a day to do it. But there was like I think there's like              |
| 17:46      | 1200 colours in the original. So he he changed that and streamlined it down. But those are            |
| 17:53      | kind of the big ones that I'm using right now. I don't really use other ones and I'm                 |
| 17:58      | I'm still playing around with a few things here and there of how I want to set it up.                |
| 18:02      | Can I second the nomination for night owl? It is gorgeous for a dark theme. I love it.               |
| 18:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 18:08      | And there are links to all of those themes that you've just mentioned in the show notes.             |
| 18:11      | I should I should say so for anybody who's looking for them, check the show notes. They're           |
| 18:15      | right there.                                                                                         |
| 18:16      | Yeah. So and that's and again, it you know, going back to what I was saying is it really             |
| 18:23      | is something that this is going to come down to a lot of people's personal preferences.              |
| 18:27      | So over time, especially with this online theme builder coming out, that's really going to           |
| 18:33      | drive and push a lot of people to create new things. And I'm I'm looking forward to that.            |
| 18:39      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by PDFpen from our friends at Smile. Does               |
| 18:44      | your PDF editor allow you to secure documents, do OCR scanning, fill out and sign forms?             |
| 18:50      | Does it allow you to do all of that on the go and at a low cost? PDFpen does. PDFpen is              |
| 18:57      | the all purpose PDF editor that allows you to improve your workflow and productivity,                |
| 19:02      | add signatures, text and images and make changes and correct typos.                                  |
| 19:07      | Improving your workflow is one of those magical things that sometimes it takes you forever           |
| 19:11      | to realise that's what you've done. And that's one of the reasons why it's so difficult              |
| 19:16      | to try and do it yourself. But if you haven't used PDFpen, then you really should. The fact          |
| 19:22      | that you can save your various different signatures as a stamp just makes it easy so that you        |
| 19:27      | always have those on hand that you need. And if a document wants you to sign in black and            |
| 19:33      | white, you can do that too. I use it for all sorts of things. Just last week, I used it              |
| 19:38      | to fix a typo in PDFs that were sent to me and send it back and let them know that as                |
| 19:43      | well as signing the document, I'd fix the typo for them. That turned out to be a big                 |
| 19:48      | time saver for me and for them because I didn't have to wait for them to fix the document            |
| 19:53      | and then send it to me again. I just fixed it and it was done.                                       |
| 19:58      | If you work at all with PDFs, you need PDFpen and you can keep everything synced too because         |
| 20:03      | PDFpen and PDFpen Pro work with PDFpen for iPad and iPhone for seamless editing across               |
| 20:10      | your devices with cloud services such as iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and more.          |
| 20:16      | You can learn more about PDFpen and PDFpen Pro at PDFpen.com/podcast. That's PDFpen.com        |

| 20:31      | RelayFM.                                                                                             |
| 20:32      | Tim, we've covered themes, which is how things look mostly. There's also syntaxes. Now,              |
| 20:40      | I know what a syntax is, but for the people at home, I think you will do a better job                |
| 20:44      | of explaining what is a syntax and why is that important in [[Drafts]]?                                  |
| 20:49      | I will try to do that justice. A syntax is just the built-in grammar that the file uses.             |
| 20:59      | You might just want simple text. You might want to write in markdown or multi-markdown.              |
| 21:03      | You may be writing JavaScript or even setting some things up in Taskpaper. Those have been          |
| 21:08      | kind of the general syntaxes for a while. What a syntax file allows you to do is it's                |
| 21:16      | a lot more complicated than a theme file is. It still uses JSON to really navigate everything,       |
| 21:25      | but you need to know regular expressions, more commonly called regex. It's not for the               |
| 21:33      | faint of heart. I think I said that in my review. It really is not for the faint of                  |
| 21:37      | heart. The only reason I think I was able to do what I've done with my own syntax of                 |
| 21:46      | [[Drafts]]down is really because I've grafted some other elements here and there to my own.              |
| 21:52      | It's really difficult to do. It's one of those things if you have an experience or                   |
| 21:58      | have somebody that can guide you, it's a good idea to do. I think the biggest reason why             |
| 22:04      | you'd want to use your own syntax is because you use the app in a certain way or have a              |
| 22:09      | certain way of setting it up. There are some syntaxes that are out there like you could              |
| 22:17      | do fountain, which is a common writing syntax that a lot of different people use and maybe           |
| 22:24      | writing screenplays, you could do that within [[Drafts]] and it'll highlight everything, how             |
| 22:29      | you would have an app that you would normally write in fountain. You can have it set up              |
| 22:34      | that way in [[Drafts]] and it just changes how you're going to use the app.                              |
| 22:41      | I think how it ties into some theming is you can set some of the way things look in your             |
| 22:50      | syntax using the theme colours or the theme scopes and making text larger, smaller, italicised,       |
| 22:57      | whatever, monospace. You can do that within your syntax file and it really can change                |
| 23:05      | how everything looks. It's a really powerful tool. I don't know if you have anything more            |
| 23:10      | to add to that, Rose.                                                                                |
| 23:12      | I would also mention that syntax is commonly referred to in programming terms, so you have           |
| 23:18      | a programming syntax and that's usually, if you open, say for example, a JavaScript file,            |
| 23:25      | then that will look one way and then if you open, I don't know, say just a text file,                |
| 23:32      | then that will just probably be like black text on a white background. Usually that's                |
| 23:35      | what happens. An application, I'm going to use [[BBEdit]] as an example here because it supports           |
| 23:40      | thousands of different programming syntaxes, at least I think so. It certainly supports              |
| 23:44      | hundreds of them. That's what it's doing. That's the magic that's behind it there.                   |
| 23:49      | Just a slightly different explanation, but I think you covered that very well.                       |
| 23:54      | It feels like this is one where you're really threading the needle because Greg, the [[Drafts]]          |
| 24:01      | developer has already done an excellent job of syntax support for the usual suspects. The            |
| 24:08      | stuff you're often going to be using to write [[Drafts]] like Markdown. I think even as Critic           |
| 24:13      | Markdown in there, I was just looking to see if he already put it in there.                          |
| 24:17      | That's actually built into the MultiMarkdown. The Critic Markup is built into MultiMarkdown          |
| 24:22      | and it's great.                                                                                      |
| 24:24      | He's got that in there. A lot of the syntax that most people would want is already baked             |
| 24:31      | in, but I guess he had just enough people asking, can I make it custom that he said,                 |
| 24:37      | okay, well, I'll give you the tools to go in and write your own. This is one I'm very                |
| 24:42      | curious to see, number one, what do people do with it? Number two, will I ever have                  |
| 24:47      | any interest in it? While I'm super interested in theming it properly, the syntax thing to           |
| 24:53      | me is a snoozer because I largely just write Markdown for everything. When I do coding               |
| 25:01      | to the extent I do coding, I don't do it in draft. I'm not sure how much this is going               |
| 25:06      | to be for a lot of people, but I think this is a feature that's going to be super useful             |
| 25:11      | to a couple of people and a lot of people are just going to pass this one by.                        |
| 25:15      | Well, I think for a lot of people, it will enhance things. Say, for example, somebody                |
| 25:20      | who uses Jekyll or Hugo or something as their blogging platform, normally that's got a block         |
| 25:26      | at the top that's got three dashes above it and three dashes below and then inside it                |
| 25:30      | that's a [[YAML]] format. Something like that, you can now do in [[Drafts]] and that can have                |
| 25:36      | its own bit of theming because it knows that that's there because it's got the starter               |
| 25:41      | and the ender and then the rest of it's in Markdown. That's something that's much easier              |
| 25:45      | to do and have look right because I know that's something I've struggled with before                 |
| 25:49      | where I just wanted that bit to display in like mono space and then I wanted the rest                |
| 25:55      | of it to be pretty Markdown as I was used to and I couldn't do that at the time and                  |
| 25:59      | now I can do that and that's what I like about this.                                                 |
| 26:03      | I think David, you're right. This is something that I think in a short term, there's not             |
| 26:08      | going to be a whole lot of people that find this useful because they're going to go, okay,           |
| 26:11      | great, number one, how do I do it? And then number two, what do I do with it? And really             |
| 26:17      | the answer to the how is, well, you got to know some regex and you got to get some help              |
| 26:22      | if you don't know that and you got to work on it. But really, what do you do with it?                |
| 26:27      | There's a lot of possibilities that could come from it. Myself, like with, so I created              |
| 26:32      | a syntax called [[Drafts]] down and it just, I started with the multi Markdown that's built              |
| 26:37      | in. So I have all the critic Markup. I have all of the features of Markdown and multi                |
| 26:42      | Markdown. So everything's in there already. And you can export syntax files the same way             |
| 26:50      | you do theme files and [[Drafts]]. So it's a pretty easy thing to grab that file. But I                  |
| 26:56      | started including, because I will often to emphasise something in my writing, I made                 |
| 27:01      | bold and italicise it. And that's not something that's built into the multi Markdown. It's           |
| 27:05      | occasionally that can get a little weird with just how it highlights, but I put that in              |
| 27:11      | there. And, and so that's in there now for me. And I've incorporated some other things               |
| 27:16      | because I use multi Markdown primarily for things that I use for work. So when I talk                |
| 27:24      | about work task management and how I do things at work in my job, I'm constantly using [[Drafts]]        |
| 27:31      | for it. And I just go back and forth wiki style linking everything. So I can move freely             |
| 27:36      | through some some different [[Drafts]] that I have. But I've started to incorporate task                 |
| 27:43      | lists in greater form. And I mean, really, it was probably about a week before the [[Drafts]]            |
| 27:51      | 26 got released that I was really starting to play with two state and three state tasks.             |
| 27:58      | Those are the checkboxes that you see within [[Drafts]]. But it it's the three state tasks               |
| 28:04      | are really interesting because that's not part of multi Markdown. That as it's as it's               |
| 28:09      | shipped in the app, you have to actually use a simple list or simple list plus syntax to             |
| 28:15      | get those. And so I just combined those two things together to say, All right, here's                |
| 28:19      | multi Markdown, here's a simple list. And I can combine these two. It wasn't much effort             |
| 28:25      | it took a little time, but I got it in there. And now I can have, you know, either tasks             |
| 28:30      | that like, once it's done, it's done, or hey, I need to ask somebody something, I'll mark            |
| 28:36      | it in process. And it when it's completed, it'll get grayed out and struck through. So               |
| 28:43      | I don't have to see that task visually. It's, it's, it's just a simple change that I've              |
| 28:47      | made, but it's been a big difference so far. Yeah, another thought that occurs to me is              |
| 28:53      | the Markdown, what I'll call Markdown plus apps, apps that use Markdown as a starting                |
| 28:58      | point. But then they add things, you know, like these PKM apps do have like task management          |
| 29:03      | syntax or or linking syntax. And there's no reason why you couldn't write custom syntax              |
| 29:10      | and [[Drafts]] to make that process a lot easier to create the notes and [[Drafts]] and go ahead             |
| 29:17      | and apply custom syntax.                                                                             |
| 29:19      | Right. And even one of the other things you can do in a syntax is up at the top, there's             |
| 29:25      | a little tiny carrot next to the draft symbol. And that's a navigation window. And when you're       |
| 29:32      | in a draft, you can navigate to the different headers of a draft. Well, now you can set              |
| 29:36      | navigation points that are incomplete tasks. So that's actually one of the things I've               |
| 29:42      | I've used is any of my incomplete or in process tasks, I can quickly navigate to one using           |
| 29:48      | that portion of it. So I can just jump to that and mark it really quickly because some               |
| 29:52      | of my lists are very long with the amount of tasks that I'm either undertaking or assigning          |
| 29:58      | to people as part of my day to day job. So it's, it's something that makes me navigate               |
| 30:03      | even quicker and you can, you can do that a whole lot easier now and you can do that                 |
| 30:07      | with anything. So if there's keywords that you want to set up, so say somebody creates               |
| 30:12      | a syntax that has the, you know, the word to do in their TODO and a colon, you could                 |
| 30:19      | make that so you can navigate to that element throughout the draft. So it, it can start              |
| 30:24      | to extend the app even farther than it is today and more use cases going forward.                    |
| 30:30      | Do you guys use that feature in [[Drafts]], the reorder feature? Are you familiar with this?             |
| 30:35      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 30:36      | Oh, arrange mode?                                                                                    |
| 30:37      | All the time.                                                                                        |
| 30:38      | I, you know, I don't know why every text editor on the market doesn't steal that feature.            |
| 30:43      | It is the best, you know, because like for writing blog posts or even legal briefs, I                |
| 30:48      | find, you know, one of the last steps to do is just go into that mode and fill, you know,            |
| 30:53      | give myself free reign to move things around. And for listeners that aren't aware, they              |
| 30:58      | have the ability in [[Drafts]] to drag as a starting point paragraphs up and down, you can just          |
| 31:04      | move them around. But with [[Drafts]], it gets even more granular. I think it goes down to               |
| 31:08      | the sentence level of memory serves. And, and you can just, you can reorder your text.               |
| 31:14      | And after you get to writing things, it makes a lot of sense to take some time and look              |
| 31:19      | at it again to make sure the organisation makes sense. And this easy rearrange is so,                |
| 31:26      | so powerful.                                                                                         |
| 31:27      | Yeah. There's, there's times that I've sat in meetings where I'm using my iPad jotting               |
| 31:32      | down notes and, you know, I'll have multiple tasks come in and I'm in a range and I'm trying         |
| 31:39      | to order them in priority. Because I typically don't use a numbered list because things jump         |
| 31:44      | priority one day to the next. And so I will, I'll be sitting there in that mode and I'm              |
| 31:50      | like, Oh, I got to exit this because, you know, I need to write another task down. Oh,               |
| 31:54      | no, I don't. I can just duplicate the line and inside the arrange mode, little pro tip,              |
| 31:59      | you can just edit the text there. So you can duplicate a line and you can edit the text              |
| 32:04      | right in a range mode. So you don't need to leave that if, especially if you're doing                |
| 32:07      | some minor modifications here and there. And then you can just tap done and everything               |
| 32:12      | just magically moves around where you want it. And it's set. I do that all the time.                 |
| 32:17      | And it, it is one of those features again, where it's, it's built in and before we didn't            |
| 32:23      | have that to the extent that we have it now. And I don't ever want to go with another app            |
| 32:30      | that does not have that it is that vital to me in my workflow.                                       |
| 32:33      | I use this all the time because I, I have a lot of Taskpaper templates for various projects.        |
| 32:39      | So, you know, for example, every single episode of automators and as to folders, I was today         |
| 32:44      | guest podcast them on things like that, they all have task templates. And whenever I'm               |
| 32:48      | going through an editing them and I want to rearrange some tasks in, in that template,               |
| 32:53      | so that, you know, things get created and they're in the right order. I do that. And                 |
| 32:56      | it's just like that, that mode is a game changer for people who ever rearrange lines. There          |
| 33:03      | is no more cutting and pasting and stuff like that. You just drag it up and down and done.           |
| 33:07      | And it's so easy.                                                                                    |
| 33:08      | Yep.                                                                                                 |
| 33:09      | I do think though, getting back to syntax, this is going to be a feature that is going               |
| 33:13      | to get filled out by the community pretty quickly. And I would, I would recommend for                |
| 33:19      | listeners that don't want to go as deep down the rabbit hole as Tim has. It's just keep              |
| 33:24      | an eye on the community syntax plugins because I suspect that, I mean, because you already           |
| 33:30      | have most what you need built in the app. I think that the few exotic things that most               |
| 33:35      | people would be looking for are going to exist pretty rapidly.                                       |
| 33:39      | Right. And the things that I see in the future for people to create in, you know, I kind             |
| 33:46      | of have my journalling workflow already set. But for people that do, you know, bullet journalling,     |
| 33:53      | this is something where you could literally create a syntax and you can have the different           |
| 33:57      | markers, I guess, for each line be different, be a different colour. You could, you can have          |
| 34:05      | them do different things so that as you're moving through the app, it could really be                |
| 34:10      | like how you would write a bullet journal by hand, you could do it digitally. It takes               |
| 34:15      | a lot more work to set this up, but it's something that could be done if somebody really wanted      |
| 34:21      | it. And I think that's something that that the with the theming and syntax highlighting,             |
| 34:28      | those two things together can create some really powerful customisations for people                  |
| 34:33      | to really make it an app that maybe they didn't have a huge use for beyond a scratch pad,            |
| 34:39      | but then now can turn into their daily bullet journal and really take it to another level.           |
| 34:45      | Yeah. And when you get tired of it, you change the theme, you've got the same syntax.                |
| 34:50      | Right. And for those that are thinking, Hey, you know, a digital bullet journal, I like              |
| 34:54      | using my, my, my handwriting, right? You know, I like writing my hand. Well, in version              |
| 35:00      | 22, we, you know, scribble came along. And that's something you can use there too. It's              |
| 35:08      | it's great. I use scribble with [[Drafts]] all the time. And it I can write by hand, I can               |
| 35:15      | type it in, it doesn't really matter. And that and that's just a another example of                  |
| 35:20      | how great these little features are. Since we've gone from [[Drafts]] five to 26. Now, all               |
| 35:27      | these little features are just huge usability improvements that are just fantastic.                  |
| 35:32      | I have linked to the most popular pay or the ordering of the most popular syntaxes and               |
| 35:38      | themes in the show notes for everybody, by the way. So if you're there going, I want                 |
| 35:43      | to try things out, then it's there. And I'm very pleased to report that as of the time               |
| 35:46      | of recording [[Drafts]] down Tim, your, your custom syntax is the most popular syntax by probably        |
| 35:53      | a large margin. So I'm very pleased to see that.                                                     |
| 35:56      | I hope it doesn't stay there long. I hope other people come along and do great, wonderful            |
| 36:01      | things with this because I'm I'm really just making it for me. I mean, I'm not sounding              |
| 36:06      | I hope I'm not sounding conceded in any way. It's just I'm making this for me. And if other          |
| 36:10      | people find uses for this, fantastic. And I hope other people create some things that                |
| 36:16      | are really awesome that other people can use.                                                        |
| 36:19      | So Rose, have you gone down the rabbit hole of [[Drafts]] theming and syntax yet?                        |
| 36:23      | So I have started specifically, I was talking earlier about the the Jackal Hugo theming              |
| 36:30      | and that's something that I am messing with. But it's such a local mess. It's it's one               |
| 36:35      | of those things where I'm looking at it. And I've not had the time to just sit down and              |
| 36:39      | properly do it. So I've been trying to do it in sort of five minute chunks between doing             |
| 36:43      | other things. And I can tell you if you have not looked at the documentation, and you don't          |
| 36:48      | really know what you're doing. Hi, yes, this is me. Then it's worth sitting down and having          |
| 36:54      | a quick look through and looking at how some other people have done things. And of course,           |
| 36:58      | as Tim said, exporting one of the built in ones, which is close to what you want. And                |
| 37:03      | then, you know, modifying that and then re importing it. And I definitely second the                 |
| 37:09      | recommendation you made at the top to Tim for JSON J A Y S O N. That is a an excellent               |
| 37:14      | app for doing this because it makes it very, very easy to create valid JSON. JSON is a               |
| 37:21      | very picky syntax. If you miss a quotation mark or at a comma where you shouldn't, you               |
| 37:25      | will break it. So it's good to have an app that protects you from yourself.                          |
| 37:29      | Yeah. Yeah, I went down. Yeah, I tried to play with the themes and it doesn't really                 |
| 37:35      | seem that hard to customise them if you want. But I found night owl and it was like love             |
| 37:40      | it for sight. And I've been using night owl now. And I don't know that I'm going to be               |
| 37:45      | switching off of it anytime soon. It's just such a great theme.                                      |
| 37:48      | Oh, I'm well, I'm using Tim's light and dark themes. And I've set those up. So my editor             |
| 37:52      | auto switches at well with the system. So that's, you know, when sun comes up and when               |
| 37:58      | the sun comes down, which of course recently changed. So that's not at all confusing. Fortunately,   |
| 38:03      | my Mac knows what I'm doing there.                                                                   |
| 38:05      | And we didn't mention it, but in the preferences for [[Drafts]], there are buttons to get themes         |
| 38:11      | and get syntaxes at the bottom of each screen. So don't when you open the app, you'll see            |
| 38:18      | a limited number built in, but there is so much more out there. Just push the button                 |
| 38:22      | and go go try some of these out.                                                                     |
| 38:25      | This episode of the automators podcast is brought to you by Microsoft lists, a Microsoft             |
| 38:31      | 365 app that helps you track information and organise work. Keeping track of information             |
| 38:37      | is something that's in everyone's job description these days. Quite simply, writing things down      |
| 38:42      | is what works for simple lists, but it can get overwhelming when you need to stay on                 |
| 38:47      | top of hundreds of items and get others to pay attention and act. Microsoft lists is                 |
| 38:52      | a Microsoft 365 app that helps you easily track information and organise your work.                  |
| 38:58      | Lists are simple, smart and flexible, so you can stay on top of what matters most to your            |
| 39:03      | team. You can track issues, assets, routines, contacts, inventory and more using customisable        |
| 39:09      | views and smart rules and alerts to keep everyone in sync. With ready made templates, you can        |
| 39:15      | quickly start lists online on the new mobile app for iOS and directly within Microsoft               |
| 39:21      | Teams. And because it's part of Microsoft 365, you can rely on enterprise ready security             |
| 39:27      | and compliance. I spent some time with Microsoft lists and I'm impressed. I feel like Microsoft      |
| 39:33      | has really threaded the needle with this one, giving you a product that's simple to use,             |
| 39:38      | but also complex enough to manage in Teams, which is not easy. It's not easy to make an              |
| 39:44      | app that can be easy to use, but also work with a group of people and that's what they've            |
| 39:48      | done with Microsoft lists. If you're already using Microsoft Teams or Microsoft 365, this            |
| 39:54      | one is a no brainer. It's an excellent app and definitely worth checking out. So if you              |
| 39:59      | want your list to get a whole lot smarter, get more done with Microsoft lists. Go to                 |
| 40:04      | aka.ms slash ms lists for more information, videos, demos, blogs and more. That's aka.ms             |
| 40:12      | slash ms lists. Make a list and let it flow. Our thanks to Microsoft lists for their support         |
| 40:19      | of the Automators and all of Relay FM. So Tim, you don't just write in [[Drafts]]. You automate          |
| 40:27      | things. You mentioned before you've got a bunch of things that just happen. What are                 |
| 40:31      | these things that just happen? What are you actually automating in [[Drafts]]? And they're               |
| 40:36      | small automations, right? But anytime I hit command K, which is a very common keyboard               |
| 40:42      | shortcut, it inserts a markdown link, right? So even though that's something that I just             |
| 40:48      | do and it's muscle memory for me now, that's still a script running in the background. It's          |
| 40:53      | still a little bit of an automation that just pops a little bit of text in with a formatted          |
| 40:58      | URL for me. And it's done. Those are the little things. Keyboard shortcuts. And there's a            |
| 41:06      | new setting that allows you to turn those on. So as you see it in the action group on                |
| 41:13      | the right hand side of the app, you can kind of see what your keyboard shortcuts are. At             |
| 41:17      | this point, I don't know how many pages I want to say, maybe eight of keyboard shortcuts             |
| 41:21      | that I have. And sometimes I don't remember everything that I have. So it's it's a good              |
| 41:26      | visual indication for me that, oh, hey, I can, I can use a simple shortcut to then kick              |
| 41:32      | off an action, which maybe just format some text. And that's, that's primarily, I think              |
| 41:37      | out of all the automations that I use, that is my primary one is within the app, text                |
| 41:43      | manipulation is probably my biggest single automation that I'm using. Aside from that,               |
| 41:49      | the other automations that I'm using, and where it really comes into the play with theming,          |
| 41:55      | not so much syntax right now, but theming is workspaces. So workspaces is, you know,                 |
| 42:01      | that basically in short terms, a collection of [[Drafts]] with tags applied to them. So you              |
| 42:06      | can group things together. So I have some for, you know, one for writing, one for scripting,         |
| 42:12      | I have one for journalling, I have one for work. And so what I do with that now, and what             |
| 42:18      | I've done with my module script, which is something I talked about way back in [[Drafts]]                |
| 42:24      | five, I can now set a theme based on that keyboard shortcut. It's not something that                 |
| 42:31      | happens automatically, I've actually asked Greg to put it in so that when you switch                 |
| 42:35      | a workspace, you change the theme. There's some there's some risks with doing that way.              |
| 42:40      | But I think that's something most users will find beneficial. But when I switch from, say,           |
| 42:48      | my writing syntax to my journal syntax, or my journal workspace, rather, I can just switch           |
| 42:55      | the colour of the app and make it look different. And it's, it's something that's just a visual       |
| 42:59      | change, but that is an automation that I'm doing.                                                    |
| 43:02      | Just walk through that. How are you pulling that off?                                                |
| 43:05      | So I have an action that is a module selector. So it sets the workspace, it sets the action          |
| 43:12      | group and the keyboard row. So that that way I can have all the actions in my fingertips             |
| 43:18      | that I want. And then what I've done is I've added a theme to each one of those. So now              |
| 43:24      | when I use my keyboard shortcut, I can switch and I have my modules are command two through          |
| 43:33      | command eight. And so I can switch all those modules inside of those keyboard commands.              |
| 43:41      | And so it's just jumps me from effectively what I like to say is one app to another.                 |
| 43:46      | So I can go from writing to journalling real quick. And it changes the [[Drafts]] list, it                |
| 43:51      | changes the action groups, everything and now the theme. So I know that I'm in a different           |
| 43:56      | space. On the iPhone, I use that I have that actually is an action in every single one               |
| 44:02      | of my action groups at the beginning point so I can quickly switch there. So I'll do                 |
| 44:08      | that too. Yeah, so that's an action that that changes                                                |
| 44:12      | all these settings. Is that a published action?                                                      |
| 44:15      | I don't know that it is anymore. It might not be. But you know what, I will I will get               |
| 44:20      | that out so everybody can have that link in the show notes so that people can use it.                |
| 44:24      | Yeah, because I'm doing the same thing. But I'm even though I host the automators, I'm               |
| 44:28      | doing it largely manually at this point. So you're making me jealous. How could you?                 |
| 44:33      | I do I do just to kind of put an emphasis on his discussion of the action keyboard shortcuts.        |
| 44:40      | That is something that you really should embrace if you use [[Drafts]] because not only I mean,          |
| 44:45      | there's anything you create an action on you can tie to a keyboard shortcut and it's done            |
| 44:49      | right in the edit menu for the action. And in addition to text transformations, I also               |
| 44:55      | use it for text templating. Because I love I write a lot of [[Drafts]] text that's going                 |
| 44:59      | to go somewhere else. Like, you know, I have a call with a client or whatever. I could               |
| 45:05      | make a template draft form. But I also just have the text template saved as a keyboard               |
| 45:10      | shortcut. So I don't have to monkey around with the action menu. I just, you know, hit               |
| 45:16      | the plus sign, fire off my keyboard combination and everything's there for me.                       |
| 45:20      | Yeah. And I think I think one of the things that people lose themselves in a lot. And                |
| 45:25      | I've kind of backed down a little bit here and there from doing a lot of heavy lifting               |
| 45:29      | automations, there's there's a very big place for those. But the simple automations sometimes        |
| 45:35      | tend to be the right ones. It really is one of those things that's overlooked a simple               |
| 45:41      | action to move one thing to another place. You know, I liken it to a forklift. So I work             |
| 45:47      | in automotive, but you know, we have different robots and the plants that pick up from one           |
| 45:52      | location, drive it down a line and put it in another location. It's it's a simplified                |
| 45:59      | task at that point, but it's an automation. And that's that's kind of the the nice thing             |
| 46:04      | about [[Drafts]] is that you can use a lot of those little actions. And you can either have              |
| 46:08      | them in the keyboard row, you could have them as a keyboard shortcut so that when you have           |
| 46:13      | an iPad or an external keyboard connected, you can just do that. Obviously, I'm I'm very             |
| 46:17      | iOS centric. So I'm the Mac is is just as capable. And it's probably even more capable               |
| 46:24      | when you combine that with, you know, [[AppleScript]] and things like that. So yeah. And                |
| 46:28      | the nice thing about the simple automations is they never break. They just seem to work              |
| 46:32      | forever. Yeah, they do. The thing that in going back rows to your question, you know,                |
| 46:39      | for me, things that I automate are are really my own workflows and my own way of working             |
| 46:46      | and using the app. By and large, a lot of what I do with [[Drafts]] has not changed. I'm                 |
| 46:52      | very boring in that way. I use it, I use it for everything that I possibly can. And where            |
| 46:58      | it doesn't work, I use another app. But I use it for writing for journalling, those                   |
| 47:03      | sorts of things. So I have my automation that I've had for a while to publish to WordPress.          |
| 47:10      | So I use that all the time. When I when I do my writing for my journal, I've created                 |
| 47:17      | a PDF version of my journal. So now I not only have the text save within [[Drafts]], but                 |
| 47:23      | I also send that over to shortcuts, create a formatted PDF and save that PDF off. It's               |
| 47:30      | just it's just a quick, easy automation. It runs very quickly. And it just allows me                 |
| 47:38      | to process some [[Drafts]] out of the system. So it's not as overwhelming.                               |
| 47:42      | Sure. And do you do is that like a daily thing? Or do you run it a certain increment of time?        |
| 47:48      | My intention was daily. Sometimes it's not sure. So so that that particular one, and                 |
| 47:55      | I can maybe create a one to share with with the users. So we'll have to put that one in              |
| 48:00      | notes too. But I think it just grabs the title, which I how I format my journal is very much         |
| 48:09      | a date goes in the title field. I have a section of kind of just some metadata on the day,           |
| 48:15      | you know, how much I slept what the weather's going to be like, just some little simple              |
| 48:19      | things that shortcuts provides. And then it just gives me a couple little fields for what            |
| 48:26      | I called quick hits, and then some entries. And so there's a lot of times where I will               |
| 48:32      | journal and it'll just be a lot of quick hits for the day. And I really don't have a whole           |
| 48:35      | lot of say, I'm not really writing profoundly every day. Sure. But sometimes, like the other         |
| 48:42      | night I had a crazy vivid dream and I sat down and wrote that out and how I felt about               |
| 48:46      | it. And it just that that's what ended up coming out for that day. But then sometimes                |
| 48:52      | I forget to run the action at night. And there's a couple times where I've forgotten to run          |
| 48:57      | it for a couple of weeks. But the beauty of it is I can run that quickly. And it just                |
| 49:03      | processes it very, very fast. In fact, excuse me, I will. In fact, I will have a draft window        |
| 49:12      | on the one side of my iPad, I will have a shortcut window on the other side of my iPad.              |
| 49:16      | And it just I can just watch it in real time run. And it's just it takes me all of about             |
| 49:21      | five minutes to process a bunch of them.                                                             |
| 49:23      | I'm just thinking out loud when the time based shortcuts trigger allow you to run that action        |
| 49:27      | without you having to do it yourself? I think it would.                                              |
| 49:32      | It would. The only thing I would have to do is save the I mean, I could probably do it               |
| 49:38      | for that day. That's actually not a bad rabbit hole for me to go down at some point. It's            |
| 49:43      | just something that I could do that. Actually, you know what? I will take that on as an assignment.  |
| 49:49      | Thanks for giving me homework.                                                                       |
| 49:50      | There we go. I'm going to have to do that.                                                           |
| 49:52      | Everybody goes home from this podcast with homework, Tim. You are no exception being                 |
| 49:55      | guest.                                                                                               |
| 49:56      | Fantastic. Great.                                                                                    |
| 49:57      | But good news is you're probably going to get an A. So yeah, let's hope so.                          |
| 50:02      | And the other thing that's cool with that workflow is you can set up the formatting of the PDF       |
| 50:08      | as you want. So in this case, you said it's your journal. So you want it to look nice                |
| 50:12      | as it goes into this PDF file.                                                                       |
| 50:14      | Well, actually, the funny thing is it does format pretty well. And it really mimics what             |
| 50:22      | I had in [[Day One]]. So I used to use [[Day One]] years ago. There were some security things                |
| 50:30      | that happened that I particularly was not a fan of. And so I moved that to my own solution           |
| 50:36      | within [[Drafts]] at the time. But now, you know, I look at the value of what I have in [[Drafts]]           |
| 50:41      | where it saves me from a couple of different subscriptions with other apps, writing apps,            |
| 50:46      | journalling apps, et cetera. I don't need to use those apps. I can just use [[Drafts]] and                |
| 50:51      | I have one payment. It's a cost proposition at that point for me.                                    |
| 50:57      | One of my favourite drums to bang on is the idea of contextual computing and the idea                 |
| 51:02      | of mode shifting. And you, I think, everyone I've talked to has accomplished that the best           |
| 51:09      | with [[Drafts]] in these early days of themes. But it sounds like you've really kind of gone             |
| 51:14      | deep on getting a different context for different modes of doing [[Drafts]].                             |
| 51:19      | Yeah. I try to do that as much as possible because I know that staying in one place,                 |
| 51:27      | you know, there's people that I know that use, I'll use Gmail as an example. I use Gmail             |
| 51:33      | at work. That's our preferred platform at work. And I know some people that have personal            |
| 51:39      | Gmail accounts and there's times that they have trouble keeping those two contexts separate.         |
| 51:46      | And blending work and personal is never good. So for me, by extension, just keeping those            |
| 51:51      | contexts separate of, hey, you know, in my journal, my journal stuff never gets shared.              |
| 51:56      | That's not a public thing. That's for me. So having a, not only a visual cue from a colour            |
| 52:03      | standpoint, but even a potential different syntax that I can use there is going to help              |
| 52:09      | drive that, okay, I am journalling now. This is journal time. I don't need to focus on                |
| 52:13      | anything else but journal. And then the other times where I'm using my writing, this is              |
| 52:18      | writing time. That's what I need to use. So it's, it's a, it's something that I'm, I'm               |
| 52:22      | still going through its early days, but I'm still going through it. And now that I can,              |
| 52:29      | you know, use the syntax or sorry, not syntax, but the theme scripting and change that I             |
| 52:36      | can, I think it's just one more step towards, you know, creating all these mini apps and             |
| 52:43      | automating my way through it.                                                                        |
| 52:45      | What's the, what's the missing feature in [[Drafts]] for you at this point? I mean, you                  |
| 52:48      | can even customise syntax. I don't know what's left. Oh, I have some, I have some thoughts           |
| 52:55      | actually.                                                                                            |
| 52:56      | Now, Greg Pierce is going, how long is my homework list? Sorry.                                      |
| 53:00      | Yeah, I know. Yeah. I don't, I don't think you're going to get Greg on again because                 |
| 53:03      | you asked that question. No, um, actually there's, there's two major ones for me, right?             |
| 53:07      | Like I, I still would love to see somehow, even though [[Drafts]] is a text editor, I would              |
| 53:13      | love to see image support get added. It's a whole difficulty of how you support images               |
| 53:21      | in a text format, especially with all the automations.                                               |
| 53:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 53:25      | But I, I would love to see it. There's, there's certain things that are possible now where           |
| 53:28      | you can have local files and you can render it in a window, but man inline text or inline            |
| 53:34      | image support would be probably my first and foremost. Um, but there are other people for            |
| 53:41      | a long time that have wanted file provider support. So what that, what that means is                 |
| 53:48      | I just let me either use a common directory that I can save all my drafts to [[Dropbox]],                |
| 53:54      | iCloud, whatever, so that I can use [[Drafts]] on iOS and another app on my Mac or access                |
| 54:01      | it somehow, um, or use it in other automations somewhere else. That's probably the biggest           |
| 54:06      | one that I think a lot of people want open in place, right? Like those sorts of things               |
| 54:11      | with file provider support would be hugely beneficial, I think.                                      |
| 54:15      | Yeah. Well, it just gives people even more options. Um, and then [[Drafts]] becomes the tool             |
| 54:20      | that you lay on top of those text files.                                                             |
| 54:22      | Right. I think, I think that if, if I was a betting man, that one's coming before images.            |
| 54:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 54:29      | Images is one of those things that I, I don't know if he ever has plans to add that. It's            |
| 54:33      | a, it's a dream of mine, but I, you know, I can dream all I want. It doesn't mean I'm                |
| 54:37      | going to get it.                                                                                     |
| 54:38      | Well, it's just, um, it's also kind of opposite of the whole intention of the app. Simple,           |
| 54:45      | quick text capture and fast work on text, you know, um, you've seen people do it with                |
| 54:50      | like mark down, well, how like an asset folder that holds a group of assets that you can             |
| 54:55      | mark down a link into it, you know, but I don't know. I'm, I'm not hell bent on [[Drafts]]               |
| 55:00      | going that far down that, that road.                                                                 |
| 55:04      | Yeah. I think for me, in my own use cases, very selfishly, um, and open in place. So                 |
| 55:09      | if I, if I tap a document somewhere in files or [[Dropbox]] and I can open it inside of [[Drafts]]           |
| 55:17      | and have it be, you know, just very basic, I can only edit the text. I can't do anything             |
| 55:21      | else with it and then save it back to that place again. I, I think that's a feature that             |
| 55:26      | I personally would welcome because I prefer writing in [[Drafts]] over other apps. Um, I've              |
| 55:31      | used other apps, um, I'm trying to remember some of the ones that I use. Um, uh, I can't             |
| 55:38      | even remember the names of them. I, I like pretext, I think is the one that I use the                |
| 55:42      | most for that where I just need to edit a quick file. And [[Drafts]] doesn't have a way                  |
| 55:47      | to do that without importing the file. And then I have to figure out a way to save it                |
| 55:52      | out. Um, you know, cause a lot of times I'll need a header for a file name or whatever.              |
| 55:58      | So it's just, it's a, it would solve a problem for me that I have right now. And maybe that's        |
| 56:05      | something that'll come.                                                                              |
| 56:06      | Well, I want to talk about the way you resource your [[Drafts]] files, cause you use [[Drafts]] not          |
| 56:13      | only as a production tool, but as a storage tool, but we're going to wait, let's put a               |
| 56:17      | pin in that for right now. Before we close the door on automation, um, Rose, what have               |
| 56:23      | you done lately with [[Drafts]] and automation that's worth sharing? I know you're always                |
| 56:28      | cooking something up.                                                                                |
| 56:29      | It's definitely not ready to share yet. It's in a very, very, very rough and janky state,            |
| 56:36      | um, right now, because I'm trying to figure out how best to tackle this problem. But I               |
| 56:41      | am trying to create a new draft in this workspace action. And essentially the idea for that          |
| 56:49      | is somewhere you create a template draft, which has the same name as the workspace.                  |
| 56:55      | Um, so that should be relatively logical, I would hope. Um, and then, um, it takes                   |
| 57:00      | that, uh, and it takes the, the body of that draft and then it, it creates a new draft               |
| 57:05      | from that. Uh, but it has all the same tags as the current workspace, um, and so on. Um,             |
| 57:12      | and potentially even switches a theme. I've not quite figured out how to, to crack that              |
| 57:17      | nut yet. And of course, if, if agile torches does implement theme switching, then that's,            |
| 57:21      | I don't need to deal with that. Um, the difficulty I've been having is what if there isn't a         |
| 57:26      | theme or a template for that workspace? Um, because I, I would like to both have the                 |
| 57:34      | option of saying like, I'm just working, just let me create a new draft and boom, I'm done.          |
| 57:38      | Um, and also actually, you know what? I want to create a template for this, um, one, um,             |
| 57:44      | and things like that. Um, and potentially also handling orphan, uh, templates where you              |
| 57:49      | have templates that don't match a, um, uh, a theme, uh, or workspace. Sorry. I've got                |
| 57:54      | themes on the brain, it seems. Um, so that's, that's the nut that I am currently trying              |
| 57:58      | to crack. Um, the nuts that I've cracked considerably more recently that are actually,               |
| 58:03      | you know, ready for consumption, um, are, um, saving things into my, um, [[Obsidian]] notes              |
| 58:09      | folder in [[Dropbox]]. Sure. Um, including appending to lists. So I have a specific folder for           |
| 58:16      | lists. Um, and I have an action that will let me append to any file in that folder.                  |
| 58:22      | Um, which means that I can just write something. So say, for example, I write once upon a time,      |
| 58:27      | I can say append that to list TV shows to watch done. And then that draft disappears.                |
| 58:32      | It's gone to the trash because I filed it. Um, and then that, that is actually a list                |
| 58:37      | item in that list for me. So I can, I can get at that. And because it's in [[Dropbox]],                  |
| 58:42      | I can access it from a whole bunch of places, which makes it pretty easy.                            |
| 58:45      | I have solved or dealt with two similar problems lately. Um, like you, I also use [[Obsidian]]           |
| 58:51      | to store a lot of data and I write everything in [[Drafts]]. You know, I don't write that much           |
| 58:57      | in obsidian, at least initially. And, um, uh, because I'm using [[Obsidian\|Obsidian's]] end-to-end encryption      |
| 59:03      | model, I don't have a [[Dropbox]] resource to dump these, these files into and said, I've                |
| 59:08      | got it on my native drive on my Mac. So I made a special folder that's watched by our                |
| 59:14      | dear friend [[Hazel]]. And, um, I have, um, [[Drafts]] saved to that folder and then Mac, the Mac,           |
| 59:22      | you know, running [[Hazel]] will sort it. And if I put tags on it, it'll put it into different           |
| 59:27      | places in the base [[Obsidian]] library on my Mac. And then suddenly it, you know, it disperses          |
| 59:33      | to everywhere through [[Obsidian]] sync. But I had to, it was a, it was a different problem              |
| 59:38      | because I don't have cloud storage to work with when I'm working with [[Obsidian]] files.                |
| 59:42      | And, um, um, also because I don't use [[Drafts]] for long-term storage, I use it for the creation         |
| 59:49      | process. I have a lot of templated stuff I want to send to other places. I mean, uh,                 |
| 59:55      | so much of my life is similar, you know, in terms of things I'm taking notes on, maybe               |
| 01:00:00   | it's a call from a client or maybe it's a new idea for a YouTube video or a working                  |
| 01:00:05   | outline for automators. And so I have created just this treasure trove of templates and              |
| 01:00:11   | [[Drafts]] with text templates where it's automatically applying tags. And if you're listening to        |
| 01:00:16   | this, all you need to do to put a tag on a draft with a template is you say add a tag                |
| 01:00:23   | and you write the tag name and you put commas in, you can put as many as you want. And it            |
| 01:00:27   | adds those at the point of creation. And then those workspaces automatically indexed to              |
| 01:00:33   | those tags. So, um, I hope I'm not being too, uh, flippant about this, but I mean, it's              |
| 01:00:38   | just, it's not a very difficult process. But once you set it up, it's, it's super powerful.          |
| 01:00:44   | And I do everything with Markdown. So, you know, I've got this great Markdown syntax                 |
| 01:00:49   | highlighting with this new theme. And, and almost anything I do during the day, if somebody          |
| 01:00:54   | calls me, like I have one for a single member, California limited liability company. That's          |
| 01:01:00   | it's just like an, I'm just looking at that one's on my screen right now. So if you call             |
| 01:01:03   | me up and say, I need to make an LLC and I'm like, how many members, one member? Okay.               |
| 01:01:07   | I push one button in [[Drafts]]. All the questions I need to ask you just appear in [[Drafts]] and           |
| 01:01:12   | I fill it all out. And then I push this into [[Obsidian]] button and there it goes. You know,            |
| 01:01:18   | and I just, I just love [[Drafts]]. I don't know what we'll say.                                         |
| 01:01:22   | See, the, the interesting thing that it, you both use templates a lot. That's actually               |
| 01:01:27   | a feature of [[Drafts]] that I barely touch and I probably need to dive more into that myself.           |
| 01:01:33   | Like that's just something that I don't typically use, but I think I may have to start. Um,          |
| 01:01:38   | so it just goes to show you no matter how much you know about the app. I know people look            |
| 01:01:42   | to me like I know a lot about it. It, I don't know everything and I don't use everything.            |
| 01:01:47   | So it's, it's something that having, having people that do more, it educates me and helps            |
| 01:01:53   | me get along with new possibilities. It's going to be great.                                         |
| 01:01:56   | I also think it's, we use it in a different way. Like I use [[Drafts]]. It's just like it's              |
| 01:02:01   | in the dock. It's the app I open up every time I want to type something or write something.          |
| 01:02:05   | But it's not necessarily the place that the tech stays, you know, whereas you're using               |
| 01:02:11   | [[Drafts]] for much more, you're actually storing in there. But I think the fact that I send             |
| 01:02:15   | things out requires me to have different automations than you would need. And the fact that you      |
| 01:02:20   | keep it on [[Drafts]] means you have different automations that I wouldn't need.                         |
| 01:02:23   | Yep. Absolutely. And I think, you know, for me, a lot of, a lot of it, because your work             |
| 01:02:30   | can be done on a Mac, mine has to be done on a PC begrudgingly most of the day.                      |
| 01:02:35   | But, I mean, I can, I can still, I mean, I still use my iPad quite a deal for work.                  |
| 01:02:40   | And I'm able to tie into Gmail and the calendar and run meetings and everything off of it.           |
| 01:02:46   | It just, I have to work in a little bit of a different way because of the nature of the              |
| 01:02:49   | business. So it's, it's, yeah, there's definitely different automations. But I mean, it, maybe       |
| 01:02:55   | this, the templates are a way forward that I can do some fun things and automate some                |
| 01:03:01   | things like Rosemary was saying, right, like syntaxes, things of that nature. And even               |
| 01:03:05   | if I end up doing a task management system with [[Drafts]], which is something I've been                 |
| 01:03:11   | batting in more around in my head for a while, you know, and it kind of comes from a thought         |
| 01:03:16   | that I think Merlin Mann had for a while was like, Hey, I want Taskpaper and markdown               |
| 01:03:21   | to basically have a baby and come up with something awesome. And how do I do this? How               |
| 01:03:26   | do I, how do I make this a reality? And so I've been going through and, you know, in                 |
| 01:03:31   | the background, it's definitely not anywhere close to being a fleshed out thought of how             |
| 01:03:35   | am I going to create a task management system within [[Drafts]]? And once I do that, I'm going           |
| 01:03:39   | to need brand new templates. I will need brand new automations. And it's something I'm going         |
| 01:03:44   | to improve upon over time. It's going to be fun.                                                     |
| 01:03:47   | Tim, can I just say that you're deluding yourself? This is not hypothetical. You are                 |
| 01:03:52   | going to do it. Oh, I'm going to do it. It's a matter of time,                                       |
| 01:03:58   | which is you would think, you know, yeah, it's a when, right? You would think with,                  |
| 01:04:05   | you know, Hey, everybody's stuck inside because of COVID and all that other stuff. You would         |
| 01:04:09   | think that life is slowed down a little bit. It hasn't. So it's actually probably gone               |
| 01:04:16   | a little faster than I'd like it to. So the time element is really going to be the constraining      |
| 01:04:21   | factor. Time and knowledge, I think, uh, with, with regular expressions. That's something            |
| 01:04:27   | I lack the knowledge of and need to really improve.                                                  |
| 01:04:32   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Sync Up, a OneDrive podcast. I love finding           |
| 01:04:36   | new podcasts to listen to. And it's great to just have some more audio to really enjoy               |
| 01:04:41   | as I go about my day to day tasks. If you're looking for a new show to listen to, Sync Up             |
| 01:04:46   | takes you behind the scenes of OneDrive so you can learn about how to connect files,                 |
| 01:04:50   | share your documents, and work from anywhere. And you'll get to hear about the design and            |
| 01:04:54   | development side of things too. Each show covers a dedicated topic, guest interviews,                |
| 01:05:00   | news and announcements, plus a special topic outside of their technology norm, such as               |
| 01:05:05   | favourite article of pandemic clothing. Topics include external sharing, data security, remote        |
| 01:05:12   | work, and of course, automation. I was recently going back through the back catalogue listening        |
| 01:05:18   | to some of the episodes and I was listening to the one about external sharing. And this              |
| 01:05:23   | is a problem that I've had to deal with a lot at work. Somebody trying to send a document            |
| 01:05:27   | to me, but they're not in my organisation or me trying to send something to them. And                |
| 01:05:32   | of course, they're not where I work either. It's really interesting to hear how Microsoft            |
| 01:05:37   | like you to tackle this problem. And of course, it's led me to make some other discoveries           |
| 01:05:43   | which have really helped my workflow and I've been able to share them with my colleagues             |
| 01:05:46   | too. Go and listen to it now. Just search for Sync Up wherever you get your podcasts.                 |
| 01:05:52   | That's S-Y-N-C-U-P. Or just click the link in the show notes. Go check it out. Our thanks            |
| 01:05:59   | to Sync Up and OneDrive for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                          |
| 01:06:03   | Tim, we've been talking around the idea of storing all of your notes in [[Drafts]]. And                  |
| 01:06:10   | this wasn't really, I think, something Greg intended when he first made [[Drafts]]. I mean,              |
| 01:06:15   | [[Drafts]] was the place you went. You wrote text and you sent it out somewhere and something            |
| 01:06:18   | happened to it. But he unintentionally made this awesome note-tap that has all these storage         |
| 01:06:24   | abilities with workspaces and tags and all the features he's added. And I know you've                |
| 01:06:30   | kind of embraced this fully, right? So tell us, how is that working? What are some tips              |
| 01:06:36   | people might want to hear that they're going to think about doing this?                              |
| 01:06:40   | So one of the things that's, obviously, you know, you have workspaces. So the use of tags            |
| 01:06:45   | is pretty paramount. But in the [[Drafts]] window, you have basically three different groups             |
| 01:06:51   | that you can also utilise where it's the inbox, flagged and archived. And in a lot of my workspaces, |
| 01:06:56   | I will have the flagged element of that as something that, you know, when you flag a                 |
| 01:07:01   | draft, it doesn't show up in the inbox. It only shows up in flagged. So that way, it's               |
| 01:07:06   | kind of out of sight, out of mind on a regular basis from my regular list. And what I use            |
| 01:07:13   | something like that for is I will keep a lot of my lists. So Rose, you mentioned earlier             |
| 01:07:18   | that you have your movie lists saved to [[Dropbox]] so you can have that in [[Obsidian]] later. For          |
| 01:07:24   | me, I just keep that in [[Drafts]]. And there's an append to list action that's in the directory.        |
| 01:07:31   | And I just use that. And all of my lists are actually in my normal general workspace is              |
| 01:07:38   | what I call it. But it's in the flagged portion of it, and it's tagged list. So I can actually       |
| 01:07:44   | just switch to a different workspace and use it as a list app within within [[Drafts]]. And              |
| 01:07:52   | so for me, it's it's using the flagged and archived in addition to tags that can really              |
| 01:07:59   | kind of help with some of that. I'll call it file storage that allow me to work in that              |
| 01:08:05   | way. So I'll use an example for me for work. For work, I use three different [[Drafts]] that             |
| 01:08:13   | one of them is work tasks, work wiki, and then work accomplishments. So I will have those            |
| 01:08:20   | three [[Drafts]] in my inbox. And that's really it. Everything else, everything that I reference         |
| 01:08:28   | in my my work wiki, which holds a lot of the wiki style linking to the other [[Drafts]] that             |
| 01:08:35   | I need, all of those are are tagged work. And they're flagged so they don't show up                  |
| 01:08:40   | in the inbox. But they're all there if I need to jump into them. So it just simplifies the           |
| 01:08:47   | view for for work. And so I will jump into work tasks. And I have a little a little syntax           |
| 01:08:53   | that I use. And again, this is all custom to me. And unfortunately, with the programs                |
| 01:08:57   | that I'm working on, I can't share it. So I apologise. But it's it's one of those things             |
| 01:09:04   | that I can jump into the different programs that I'm working on, I can jump to different             |
| 01:09:08   | parts of the program. And I have a lot of that done in the wiki style linking so I can               |
| 01:09:12   | just jump around from, you know, draft to draft to draft, just easily with a tap of                  |
| 01:09:19   | a button and I'm there. So that's kind of how I've been using the storage portion of                 |
| 01:09:25   | it is is really relying on tagging for workspaces, and then flagging or archiving [[Drafts]] and         |
| 01:09:31   | then searching, you know, either having searches or, you know, just using the the quick search       |
| 01:09:37   | feature, which is I think it's shift command F, so that that way you can pull up that search         |
| 01:09:44   | window and you can really kind of dive down and see which draft you need to get to. So               |
| 01:09:50   | that's that's how I've been using it. And how I think my [[Drafts]] list does not balloon                |
| 01:09:54   | up to a massive amount. I actually have no idea how many [[Drafts]] I have. I've never sat               |
| 01:10:00   | down and figured it out. But there's a lot of them. And so I just keep I keep a lot of               |
| 01:10:06   | stuff there because I don't really have another place to send it. My wife and I share a lot          |
| 01:10:12   | of notes, but those are within notes. I don't really use another app, because, you know,             |
| 01:10:18   | getting a significant other to use the app of your choice is really difficult sometimes.             |
| 01:10:24   | But she's she's decided to use the built in notes app. She she and I work really well                |
| 01:10:29   | with that. So I will take that any day of the week. So I at least have that hurdle crossed.          |
| 01:10:36   | And so I with those are the really the two places for me is if it doesn't fit within                 |
| 01:10:41   | [[Drafts]], because it needs an image or or I need to share it with my wife, then I use                  |
| 01:10:48   | that in notes. That's it. So that's kind of how things have fleshed out for me. I think              |
| 01:10:54   | one of the really cool features for someone like you is the [[Drafts]] widget where you can              |
| 01:10:58   | attach workspaces to a button. So you can have like an eight grid, you know, two by                  |
| 01:11:04   | four grid with a small, I think isn't that the small widget? That's not even the big                 |
| 01:11:08   | one where you can just have buttons to jump to specific workspaces. Like I the stuff                 |
| 01:11:14   | I do keep in [[Drafts]], I've got attached to workspaces. Like I use it for a draft, you                 |
| 01:11:19   | know, copy that I'm going to write for the blog or something. And I can just push one                |
| 01:11:22   | button and get right to it for my home screen. I love that.                                          |
| 01:11:25   | Yeah. And that came out in [[Drafts]] 22. It's been out for a while. But when widgets came               |
| 01:11:30   | out in iOS 14, that was one of those things that I it felt weird. But [[Drafts]] isn't in                |
| 01:11:37   | my dock on my iPhone at all. I don't I don't have that in there. I used to all the time              |
| 01:11:44   | is at the centre, but I don't anymore because I use the widgets and I can I've actually              |
| 01:11:49   | even at times I've I'm like, oh, I need to switch to my journal real quick. And I just               |
| 01:11:55   | instinctively on my on my 11 I'll swipe up from the bottom and go to home and then I'll              |
| 01:12:00   | tap the journal widget because it's just that's the way I've been doing it for a little while.       |
| 01:12:07   | And it's faster for me to jump and switch different contexts that way. Yeah, makes it                |
| 01:12:11   | me it actually makes me feel now with the theme switching. It actually makes me feel                 |
| 01:12:15   | like I'm jumping into a separate app, which is kind of fun. Yeah. But yeah, the widgets              |
| 01:12:21   | are are awesome. And I love what he's done with them. My only gripe and it's not even                |
| 01:12:28   | something that he's done is I wish there was a small four by four widget because the only            |
| 01:12:34   | way you can get the grid is in the medium or large. Yeah, I just wish there was one                  |
| 01:12:38   | that had four by four because I would use that in a whole lot more places. Yeah, so                  |
| 01:12:42   | yeah. And also, this is an obvious one that would benefit from an interactive widget. It             |
| 01:12:47   | would be cool if you could have a display draft and have it interact. And that's just                |
| 01:12:51   | something [[Apple]] hasn't got to yet. I would be surprised if we don't get that at [[WWDC]]                 |
| 01:12:56   | this year. I think everybody knows. Oh, that's a feature. Yeah. Yeah, even even for their            |
| 01:13:01   | own apps, reminders, you can't check those off anymore. That's something that I just                 |
| 01:13:06   | can't believe they ship that without thinking of the usability of it. And people I'm sure            |
| 01:13:11   | people want things like that for sure. I mean, I'm just imagining an iPad full of widgets,           |
| 01:13:18   | you know, and [[Drafts]] being a big piece of that. And just like that would be that would               |
| 01:13:23   | be great. Yeah. Oh, be fantastic. And I mean, I even the interactive part, I created an              |
| 01:13:30   | action that I just called it fancy tweet because it just used the HTML previews. But I would         |
| 01:13:35   | love to be able to kick off an action. And even if it was just [[Drafts]] native UI, be able             |
| 01:13:40   | to compose a tweet and then send it and not even actually go into the app. It's just all             |
| 01:13:45   | done in the widget. I mean, I just it's it's something that I hope gets extended to other            |
| 01:13:51   | apps in iOS 15. It just it needs to be there. I think that's going to elevate the the way            |
| 01:13:58   | widgets work. If they can make that a reality for not only [[Drafts]], but others too.                   |
| 01:14:05   | Rose, how are you storing notes in [[Drafts]]? I mean, are you doing a lot of onboard storage            |
| 01:14:11   | in [[Drafts]]?                                                                                           |
| 01:14:12   | I pretty much just chuck it in a tag. And if it's not tagged, then it's in my inbox.                 |
| 01:14:18   | So I have a custom workspace called inbox, which is just looking for things that aren't              |
| 01:14:22   | tagged, which, you know, it's very simple. But it absolutely works for me. And, you know,            |
| 01:14:30   | and I'm just trying to, you know, go through and process the I don't even know how many              |
| 01:14:35   | items are in said inbox. Well, okay, let's just say that it's a four digit number right              |
| 01:14:42   | now, because I have a lot of automations which create [[Drafts]], and I've not yet updated all           |
| 01:14:46   | of them to actually have tags, which is a problem. But the good news is they all use                 |
| 01:14:52   | the same templates. So I can go through and find anything that's fault matching a particular         |
| 01:14:58   | regular expression. I'm guessing I might spend more time creating some regular expression            |
| 01:15:02   | than I will actually, you know, manually going through and looking at everything. But, you           |
| 01:15:08   | know, there's some fun. And I have to say I've had a long weekend. It's been a long weekend          |
| 01:15:12   | here in the UK. I may or may not have eaten a large number of chocolate Easter eggs and              |
| 01:15:18   | or bunnies. And I refuse to comment any further on that. So I've definitely just been adding         |
| 01:15:23   | things to my inbox and not purchasing anything because, you know, what a long weekend's for.         |
| 01:15:28   | Yeah, I get there sometimes too. And it's like for me that a big [[Drafts]] inbox means that             |
| 01:15:33   | I need to do some processing. I do use the flag. A flag to me means it's waiting for                 |
| 01:15:40   | something. Because like I said earlier, my [[Drafts]] don't really stay in [[Drafts]]. So I send             |
| 01:15:45   | them somewhere. But if I have like something I've written, I want to get feedback from               |
| 01:15:49   | someone on and I still want to have, you know, it's like once I leave [[Drafts]], whatever editor        |
| 01:15:56   | I go into isn't as good. You know, it's just the truth, you know, I mean, I don't have               |
| 01:16:00   | the ability to rearrange things and, you know, all the little features that we talk about.           |
| 01:16:05   | So if I'm waiting on something where I think I may want to do some more editing, I just              |
| 01:16:09   | flag it. And then that that's like a checklist for me to go through the flag list to say,            |
| 01:16:13   | oh, I'd never heard back from Rose on this bit of text or whatever. But I ideally like               |
| 01:16:18   | to try and get it out. But you know, that's the nice thing about the app. You can use                |
| 01:16:22   | it in a lot of different ways. I know some people that use it for work. And they use                 |
| 01:16:28   | they use a work workspace and anything that's in their inbox is is something that they need          |
| 01:16:33   | to just kind of keep tabs on, right, just kind of the day to day, anything flagged is something      |
| 01:16:40   | that they need to take action on. And then archived is something that they are waiting               |
| 01:16:44   | on information for. And so they can switch between the tabs at the top just to say, All              |
| 01:16:50   | right, what do I need to do? Right. So who's who's waiting on me? Who am I waiting on?               |
| 01:16:55   | And they can follow up based on that. The biggest thing with [[Drafts]] is that you can                  |
| 01:17:01   | really make it what you want it to be. And there's what works for one person isn't going             |
| 01:17:06   | to work for the next. But the fact that you can customise this and make it your app that             |
| 01:17:11   | it's just it's gone from a text editor and a scratch pad that you use to something that              |
| 01:17:15   | is is really what do you want to make with it? You can go and do that now. It's it's                 |
| 01:17:20   | really powerful and well worth the price of admission, for sure.                                     |
| 01:17:25   | I remember I was in trial in Los Angeles when they released the first version of the app             |
| 01:17:30   | and I downloaded it and I immediately got it. You know, I mean, it's just like, oh, this             |
| 01:17:35   | is obvious. How come nobody made this before? And and to this day, just the ability to open          |
| 01:17:40   | it up, press the microphone and start talking. I write so much text that way. And but but            |
| 01:17:48   | you forget that the other version 26, they've added so many features. What are some of the           |
| 01:17:52   | other little features that you use every day, Tim, that listeners may not be aware of?               |
| 01:17:58   | So so one that they just actually added in in 26 is that. Oh, man, I'm trying to remember            |
| 01:18:04   | what it's called. It basically you type it balance typing balance, white typing, I think             |
| 01:18:09   | is the name of it, where it automatically inserts the brackets on either side.                       |
| 01:18:12   | Yeah, so it's it's brackets, parentheses, quotes, and I'm missing one other. But it                  |
| 01:18:18   | that actually is something that it's like it. The usability functionality of that is                 |
| 01:18:24   | just something like, wow, why did why didn't this have this before? Well, I'm glad it has            |
| 01:18:29   | it now, right? It's something that I didn't know I really needed. That's something that              |
| 01:18:36   | just a little appreciative one, for sure, recently that I can bring to mind, I should                |
| 01:18:42   | pull up. And Jim, you can cut this, I'm going to pull up the change log because I forget              |
| 01:18:49   | how many things have been added over time. And I, you know, it's been a while since                  |
| 01:18:55   | I've been on the show. So I mean, really, truly, I don't even remember half of the stuff             |
| 01:18:59   | that's come out in the last year, because it really is one of those things that I just               |
| 01:19:04   | I can't keep all that stuff in my brain. Yeah, it's braces is the other one that you're              |
| 01:19:09   | you're looking for, because there's parentheses, which are the round bracket, there's brackets,      |
| 01:19:12   | the square bracket braces, which are the curly ones, and then quotes, and those are the ones         |
| 01:19:16   | that are balanced. And this is one of the the editor preferences. And I'm going to link              |
| 01:19:22   | people to the editor preferences documentation on the [[Drafts]] website, so that they can find          |
| 01:19:26   | out about that and toggle that on or off if they want to.                                            |
| 01:19:30   | So Tim, in addition to all the automation stuff you do in [[Drafts]], you're you are a primary           |
| 01:19:37   | iOS user. And yep, but you still like to automate when what are you up to and like shortcuts         |
| 01:19:43   | and other automation platforms these days? So actually, there's a couple of things I've              |
| 01:19:47   | been doing lately. So actually, in this COVID time, just before our lock down happened, my            |
| 01:19:55   | girlfriend moved in. And then, you know, several months later, I proposed to her. And she said,      |
| 01:20:02   | yes, which is great for me. And and I'm glad she puts up with me. And then we decided actually,      |
| 01:20:12   | we didn't want to wait until 2022 to have our big wedding when we can actually celebrate             |
| 01:20:16   | with people after some restrictions are lifted and everything. She's Canadian, so I have             |
| 01:20:21   | to crossed, you know, the border and I can't do that right now, even just to get married.            |
| 01:20:27   | So there were some difficulty there. So we ended up getting married in March. And so                 |
| 01:20:34   | for a little while, we, we had shortcuts on our home screens that we could tap. And one              |
| 01:20:43   | of them says, when is my wedding? And one of them said, when is the ceremony? And so                 |
| 01:20:47   | I would tap that. And in the compact UI, it would give me just a counter to when the                 |
| 01:20:52   | ceremony was taking place. Cool. I like that. The funny, it was, it's just something cute.           |
| 01:20:57   | And it was a, it was a picture of the two of us on the home screen. And the funny thing              |
| 01:21:04   | is, you know, my, my now wife, I almost said fiance, but my, my wife, you know, she's,               |
| 01:21:10   | she's fairly nerdy too. She does not play around with this kind of stuff ever. But when              |
| 01:21:16   | I showed it to her and said, I have this cool idea, just give me your phone for a second,            |
| 01:21:20   | just trust that I'm going to do this. And, you know, you'll like the result. She absolutely          |
| 01:21:25   | loved it. Like, you know, the hug that I got just for doing that is worth it alone.                  |
| 01:21:30   | So, so that's kind of something that just a little tiny thing like that where you need               |
| 01:21:35   | to keep track of a date and you can do that with a special icon on your home screen. That,           |
| 01:21:40   | that's a, that's just a little tiny automation, but it's something that I've done.                   |
| 01:21:44   | Yeah. And it's a really easy, it's a calendar action, you know, and just really nice, easy           |
| 01:21:50   | shortcut to put together any, but it could do it and, and useful. And I was just thinking,           |
| 01:21:55   | where could you run with that? Maybe you could send the, send it to a HomePod to have it            |
| 01:22:00   | speak it. When you push the button, that'd be kind of fun.                                           |
| 01:22:02   | Yep. You could do that. There was even, I thought about it as like, you know, if I                   |
| 01:22:08   | wanted to, I could, you know, set this to the bridesmaids and groomsmen, right? I could,             |
| 01:22:13   | I could have a little thing every time I run it, send them an email.                                 |
| 01:22:16   | Yeah. Just remind them.                                                                              |
| 01:22:17   | They'd love you for that. So you check it 40 times a day and then suddenly your best                 |
| 01:22:23   | man is, is, is also the one who's potentially out for your blood. But either way, congratulations    |
| 01:22:29   | are most definitely in order for that. Thank you. Thank you. I have three, I know of three           |
| 01:22:34   | COVID babies, but the Tim is my first COVID, COVID groom.                                            |
| 01:22:40   | There we go. Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. No COVID babies right now. Yeah. That's, that's, that's          |
| 01:22:46   | a different, you know, thing that'll happen later on. That'll take more of my time.                  |
| 01:22:52   | Friend of mine just had a COVID baby. I told her, you should just name her Fauci. She didn't,        |
| 01:22:58   | she didn't appreciate that at all. Not one bit.                                                      |
| 01:23:00   | No. There, there have been an uptick of baby names of Corona.                                        |
| 01:23:05   | Oh my gosh. I don't know about that. Yeah.                                                           |
| 01:23:08   | Yeah. Yep. Nope. Nope. Those are, those are not nice parents. I'm going to go on record              |
| 01:23:13   | of saying those are not nice parents. Well, I mean, I'm not sure if it's better or worse             |
| 01:23:17   | than Grogu, which apparently is becoming more and more popular for people not familiar.              |
| 01:23:22   | That is the name of the baby Yoda in the Mandalorian series.                                         |
| 01:23:25   | People are actually naming their kids Grogu.                                                         |
| 01:23:28   | It was a thing, I don't know if it was a joke article that I read the other day or if it             |
| 01:23:33   | was actually serious. It was on one of those, one of those things that it could have gone            |
| 01:23:36   | either way. I just decided to assume that some parents are making interesting choices.               |
| 01:23:41   | Yeah. I don't think anybody loves Star Wars more than me and I would not name, I wouldn't            |
| 01:23:46   | name my dog Grogu. I don't mind anyway.                                                              |
| 01:23:48   | Well, your dog is entirely too cute and cuddly for that as well, I think so.                         |
| 01:23:53   | Yeah. I'd sooner name a dog baby Yoda than Grogu. That's just my feeling on the matter.              |
| 01:24:00   | So in addition to that, one of the other things I've been actually getting into being that           |
| 01:24:04   | I'm very mobile OS focused and obviously iOS, I've been using my phone as a camera. So I             |
| 01:24:13   | actually got a bunch of moment here for Christmas this past year.                                    |
| 01:24:18   | And the nice thing about that is there's a lot of different lens options. So I actually              |
| 01:24:24   | use an anamorphic lens quite a bit to take kind of more of a cinematic photo or a cinematic          |
| 01:24:29   | video. I actually recorded our wedding using that lens.                                              |
| 01:24:33   | The interesting thing is that when you save a raw photo, those are squeezed photos. So               |
| 01:24:39   | it still puts it in the same format width wise as a regular photo that iOS would take.               |
| 01:24:46   | So I came up with an automation there to de-squeeze the photo, because you just have to do some      |
| 01:24:50   | math and fix it.                                                                                     |
| 01:24:53   | Because generally you'd have to open the moment app to actually see the anamorphic photo             |
| 01:24:56   | properly. Yeah. So I can use the iOS app if I need to take a quick picture and the lens              |
| 01:25:04   | is attached. So I can do that and still de-squeeze the photo. I can use the moment app as well.      |
| 01:25:10   | But I figured out a way now to take a photo and change it and modify it via shortcuts.               |
| 01:25:16   | Just to take a photo and do that. Simple automation that I've been running to create what I need.    |
| 01:25:23   | It's been great.                                                                                     |
| 01:25:24   | We had a couple of friends over for like the first time in a year, I think, you know, recently       |
| 01:25:30   | and we were in the backyard and we wanted to take a group photo and I set the camera                 |
| 01:25:34   | on a tripod and then use the [[Apple Watch]] camera app. This is kind of an automation. Maybe            |
| 01:25:40   | you don't know, but if you've got an [[Apple Watch]], it gives you a preview of what the                 |
| 01:25:43   | phone sees and then you can press a button on the watch and it counts down three seconds             |
| 01:25:47   | and takes a picture. And everybody was very impressed with me that I had that ability.               |
| 01:25:54   | And it's something that everybody owns an [[Apple Watch]] and an iPhone can do.                          |
| 01:25:57   | Yeah, I highly recommend that. I've used that several times just to make sure because it's           |
| 01:26:03   | easier than setting something up on a timer with a countdown and then running to get into            |
| 01:26:08   | position. You can actually be in position and make sure that you are in the shot because             |
| 01:26:13   | usually from experience, the person who does the running around to get the photo ends up             |
| 01:26:18   | being on the end and then they get kind of half cut out of the shot. And this way you                |
| 01:26:21   | can make sure that everybody's in the photo and stuff like that. And if there are small              |
| 01:26:25   | children or pets involved, then you can make sure that you can actually see what they're             |
| 01:26:30   | doing as well because you're seeing through your phone camera, which is great. So I definitely       |
| 01:26:35   | recommend that.                                                                                      |
| 01:26:36   | I have a whole host of shortcuts related to photos. I've got a whole directory of them.              |
| 01:26:42   | But that is one of the nice things about shortcuts is that it is so integrated with the camera       |
| 01:26:49   | that you can do stuff like Tim's adjusting photo size. I've got a similar one that knocks            |
| 01:26:55   | a photo down so I can post it to the Mac Power users or the automators forums without                |
| 01:26:59   | it being a gigantic photo with just a quick shortcut. Kind of does the same thing, but               |
| 01:27:04   | not really.                                                                                          |
| 01:27:05   | Yeah, but it's very useful. That sort of thing.                                                      |
| 01:27:09   | Absolutely. And I mean, beyond that, the actual place that I'm using shortcuts, and I actually       |
| 01:27:14   | use this on a daily basis is as a launcher. So you can use the widgets, but I'm a person             |
| 01:27:20   | that has gone widgets only for the home screen. And my doc is now three icons that are just          |
| 01:27:27   | some orders at the new neuomorphic icons that we're seeing. But those just those just kick           |
| 01:27:34   | off a menu action so I can open up various apps. So I have a little bit more absent my               |
| 01:27:38   | fingertips. And I don't have any badges on my home screen. I'm a person that when I see              |
| 01:27:43   | a badge, I need to check it. So if I don't see a badge, I don't have to check it, which              |
| 01:27:47   | is great. I can just deal with that later and I have to swipe over to the app library                |
| 01:27:51   | to get anything. So that's how I've been using that as of late. Just and it's just three             |
| 01:27:57   | simple menu actions, right? It's a menu action and it opens the app. I'm not doing anything          |
| 01:28:03   | other than that.                                                                                     |
| 01:28:04   | Yeah, but it's three separate launchers.                                                             |
| 01:28:07   | Yeah. That is an increasingly popular way to run an iPhone. And I'm with you. I don't                |
| 01:28:14   | like all the apps on my screen anymore.                                                              |
| 01:28:16   | Yeah. And I a while ago, I used an app called clear spaces. I still use that today where             |
| 01:28:22   | all of my widgets kind of pop out of the home screen. And then when I don't need them anymore,       |
| 01:28:27   | I swipe away. And it's just a blank screen again. So it's actually something that I really           |
| 01:28:33   | like because it's, do I need something? Okay, I know where that is. And on my home screen,           |
| 01:28:37   | I could swipe down, take a look at it, swipe back up, and then it's just a blank screen              |
| 01:28:42   | again. I've been using that quite a bit and I really like that.                                      |
| 01:28:45   | I have never heard of this app. I'll have to check that out.                                         |
| 01:28:49   | I actually have a post that we can link that kind of where I explain it. And it's a kind             |
| 01:28:55   | of a cool effect. At first, it was kind of like, oh, look at the neat thing you can do.              |
| 01:28:59   | And it basically just isn't, it's a, it's a widget that you can add to your home screen              |
| 01:29:04   | that then just blends with the background. And at first, it was kind of like, here's                 |
| 01:29:09   | this really cool hidden widget trick, right? And then I started really using it. And so              |
| 01:29:16   | like when I'm done with my tasks for the day, I don't need to see the reminder widget anymore.       |
| 01:29:22   | So I just swipe that away and it's gone. So I know that that area of my life is done.                |
| 01:29:27   | When I'm done, you know, tracking food for the day, I swipe that when I'm done with all              |
| 01:29:31   | my calendar events, I swipe that away. And, you know, so that way I'm minimising what                |
| 01:29:37   | I see on my home screen to be just really targeted and focused. And so I've been using               |
| 01:29:41   | it in that way for a while.                                                                          |
| 01:29:43   | And when you said earlier that you, that you just swipe up to get to your, to get to your            |
| 01:29:50   | [[Drafts]], I wasn't sure what you were talking about. I think that must be what it was.                 |
| 01:29:54   | Yeah. So, so what I will do it like, I guess was saying for [[Drafts]], when I'm in [[Drafts]]               |
| 01:30:01   | even, and I'm like, Oh, I got to switch to the journal. Sometimes I'll just instinctively            |
| 01:30:06   | swipe up on the home screen. It takes me to the home screen. I also have the triple back             |
| 01:30:11   | tap for that as well. So I'll just pop into the home screen and then I'll tap on the journal         |
| 01:30:18   | icon for in my [[Drafts]] widget. And it'll just pop me back into [[Drafts]], but in the journal             |
| 01:30:25   | workspace with everything applied. So that's been really good. That's kind of how I use              |
| 01:30:31   | that. And then when I don't need to see [[Drafts]] for the rest of the day, if I'm kind of done,         |
| 01:30:37   | I'm laying in bed, I'll swipe that widget away, it disappears. And I don't have to worry             |
| 01:30:41   | about it anymore. And I don't think of it. I can just kind of wind down and get ready                |
| 01:30:45   | for bed.                                                                                             |
| 01:30:46   | So this works on you taking a screenshot of your blank home screen as the underlying                 |
| 01:30:51   | effect, right?                                                                                       |
| 01:30:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:30:54   | Clever.                                                                                              |
| 01:30:55   | Clever.                                                                                              |
| 01:30:56   | It's really clever. And I mean, I remember being on the beta for it. And, you know, they             |
| 01:31:01   | weren't even sure it was going to get approved. Because one of the things that I really like         |
| 01:31:05   | about these kind of widgets is that it doesn't have the name underneath it. You know, I've           |
| 01:31:12   | always wanted to have a home screen that was free and clear of the words. I just wanted              |
| 01:31:16   | that to be an accessibility feature for forever. That way it's a little bit more visually clear.     |
| 01:31:21   | I know what apps I have put places. Don't remind me what they are. And so for me, for                |
| 01:31:28   | widgets, I didn't want to see that when I swipe away. I don't want to have like, you                 |
| 01:31:32   | know, no offense to David Smith or anything. It's just like, I don't want to see the word            |
| 01:31:35   | widget Smith on my home screen five times. I just want to see nothing. I just want the               |
| 01:31:40   | picture that I have behind it. And so this is an app that allows that. I just didn't                 |
| 01:31:44   | think that [[Apple]] was originally going to approve it. So hopefully they're not going to take          |
| 01:31:48   | that away. You know, [[Apple]] is [[Apple]]. So sometimes they do that. But hopefully, hopefully it's        |
| 01:31:55   | something that stays, but I've been using it that way for a while.                                   |
| 01:31:57   | Well, gang, if you're interested, you should probably download it soon.                              |
| 01:32:01   | Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Well, those things to grab while it's there. Because,                  |
| 01:32:07   | you know, even if you think right now that you don't want it, then, you know, if you                 |
| 01:32:10   | do in six weeks, and it turns out it's temporarily not there for whatever reason, we know [[Apple]]      |
| 01:32:15   | do these things from time to time, then, yeah, then you can get it back.                             |
| 01:32:20   | So the only thing that makes me kind of, I guess, think that they're going to allow it               |
| 01:32:26   | is that other apps have popped up that offer the same functionality. And so those are all            |
| 01:32:31   | approved as well. Again, not a guarantee, but it's likely that maybe that feature can                |
| 01:32:37   | stay.                                                                                                |
| 01:32:38   | Well, I'll cross my fingers. I do have this app. And yeah, it's, it's quite handy. I've              |
| 01:32:44   | been experimenting with it a little bit. And I now I've heard you talking about how it works         |
| 01:32:49   | because obviously, you know, I've read your post before, but now I've heard you talking              |
| 01:32:54   | about it. I'm going to give it another shot in the same way that you're doing it.                    |
| 01:32:57   | I've actually expanded. I'm so into the widgets. Now I have like three screens of widgets.           |
| 01:33:02   | I used to have just one.                                                                             |
| 01:33:03   | Whoa.                                                                                                |
| 01:33:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:33:05   | And like, like,                                                                                      |
| 01:33:06   | So what are you running?                                                                             |
| 01:33:08   | Well, I'm not running clear spaces. You see them and you see the ugly labels, but, um,               |
| 01:33:14   | you know, just they're all kind of contextual. My main screen is the big, fantastic Al with          |
| 01:33:19   | a list of my events for the day and the, the, the medium widget with the four shortcuts              |
| 01:33:25   | launchers, you know, but I do like launchers with shortcuts like you, but I do it out of             |
| 01:33:29   | a widget.                                                                                            |
| 01:33:30   | I just really liked the interface elements of the widget. I feel like it's, it's the                 |
| 01:33:34   | way shortcuts really need to be run. And then I've got a screen with, um, that's like                |
| 01:33:40   | kind of like task management. It's got OmniFocus and streaks. And then I've got a time              |
| 01:33:45   | tracking page and then a little bit of a, you know, mix of things at the end. And then               |
| 01:33:52   | I get to the app, the app library. And so, and it works fine for me. I mean, I, and then             |
| 01:33:57   | if also the, what is it, what do these call the debut? I've got like, um, timely things              |
| 01:34:02   | like weather, time, world, I can see what time it is where Rose lives, you know, stuff               |
| 01:34:06   | like that.                                                                                           |
| 01:34:07   | And I think that's, I mean, it's one of those things and tying it back to what we were just          |
| 01:34:12   | talking about in the beginning of the show with [[Drafts]] and, and making it your own.                  |
| 01:34:16   | I just, I like that, you know, there's a lot of functionality that we have today in a lot            |
| 01:34:22   | of what we use, Mac, iOS, whatever. And specifically with iOS and the iPhone, how much we use that   |
| 01:34:29   | and it's so, such a personal device now. Now we have so many options to make it your own.            |
| 01:34:34   | I really like the way this is headed. And I feel that it's being done in a, in the right             |
| 01:34:39   | way. I think there's some features that are missing, but I think, I think as we go on                |
| 01:34:44   | in iOS 15, hopefully just iOS 15, but likely iOS 16, that we're going to see a lot more              |
| 01:34:50   | of this customisation happen. And I think that's going to be really cool.                            |
| 01:34:53   | I was just talking to an app developer friend on the phone the other day about this very             |
| 01:34:57   | thing. I think that the next, like the undiscovered country of the iOS apps is the user interface    |
| 01:35:05   | customisability, like us being able to make it work the way we want it to look like is               |
| 01:35:13   | the next thing that app developers need to run to. And [[Drafts]] is kind of already there               |
| 01:35:18   | with what they've just recently done. Carrot Weather has done some stuff like that too. But I do       |
| 01:35:24   | think that's like where we want to go.                                                               |
| 01:35:27   | Oh, and those are probably my two favourite examples for customisation, right? Just Carrot Weather      |
| 01:35:32   | knocks it out of the park always, every time. It just seems that he can't really do much             |
| 01:35:39   | wrong when he comes to developing apps, which is fantastic. Complaints about being cussed            |
| 01:35:46   | out or treated like a meatbag outside. But for him, it's a great example of how can you              |
| 01:35:53   | make this work for you instead of you just living with the interface. How can you make               |
| 01:35:58   | it work for you and make it better to suit your needs? That is the next frontier, I think,           |
| 01:36:03   | for all of us.                                                                                       |
| 01:36:04   | Yeah, I would agree with that. And for people who haven't checked out Karat 5 and the customisation  |
| 01:36:11   | options in it, it's pretty cool. You can design your own interface so that you have                  |
| 01:36:16   | all the weather that you like. And I've definitely been playing around with that quite a bit.        |
| 01:36:21   | All right, Tim. Well, for folks listening, Tim is the master of all things [[Drafts]], the               |
| 01:36:28   | future developer of the [[Drafts]] task management workflow. Tim, where do people go to find             |
| 01:36:38   | you?                                                                                                 |
| 01:36:39   | Well, I'm on Twitter at Nahumck, my last name, N-A-H-U-M-C-K. And you can go to Nahumck.me           |
| 01:36:50   | to find where I write. And that's pretty much where you can find me nowadays.                        |
| 01:36:55   | Now, we sure appreciate you sharing all this with us, Tim, and the great stuff you're doing          |
| 01:37:00   | and keep it up, man. So we had you at [[Drafts]] version 5 and version 26. So I guess we'll              |
| 01:37:07   | see you around version 50. I don't know.                                                             |
| 01:37:09   | Yeah, sounds good to me.                                                                             |

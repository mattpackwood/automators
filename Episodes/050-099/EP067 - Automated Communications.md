| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the show where we talk about automation and how to                                                           |
| 00:06      | get your technology to do all of the hard bits of your life for you.                                                                           |
| 00:09      | My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                                                         |
| 00:13      | Hey David, how are you?                                                                                                                        |
| 00:14      | I'm doing great, Rose.                                                                                                                         |
| 00:15      | Happy New Year.                                                                                                                                |
| 00:16      | Happy New Year to you as well, and happy New Year to all our listeners, though we did record                                                   |
| 00:20      | the last show just before the New Year, and it released on January 1st, so you may have                                                        |
| 00:24      | already heard from us this year.                                                                                                               |
| 00:25      | But it's the first time I've talked to you in 2021, officially, so.                                                                            |
| 00:29      | It is, yes.                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:31      | But it is a wonderful time of year to start looking at the things that maybe didn't go                                                         |
| 00:37      | quite so well in your life last year and that you could improve on for this year.                                                              |
| 00:40      | I know that's what I'm doing with a lot of things, and one of them I really need to fix                                                        |
| 00:43      | is communication, because oh my gosh, communication has gone haywire in the last nine months.                                                  |
| 00:49      | Yeah, I mean, we've stopped meeting people in real life, and electronic communications                                                         |
| 00:54      | are more important than ever now.                                                                                                              |
| 00:56      | They absolutely are, and it's one of these things where life has changed a lot.                                                                |
| 01:00      | Some of it will be permanent, some of it will be temporary.                                                                                    |
| 01:03      | I know a lot of companies have brought up chat systems and things like that where they                                                         |
| 01:07      | didn't have anything in place before, because the way that you did this before was by popping                                                  |
| 01:11      | by somebody's cubicle or their office.                                                                                                         |
| 01:14      | And guess what?                                                                                                                                |
| 01:15      | That's not such a good idea right now, even if you are in the office.                                                                          |
| 01:19      | So yeah, we thought we'd take a look at some automated communication today, because what                                                       |
| 01:25      | better, what can you do better with automation than automated, or communication than automated?                                                |
| 01:31      | All right, so let's start with email, because I feel like that is the, you know, the one,                                                      |
| 01:36      | the bane of everyone's existence, and frankly, one of the most fertile grounds for automation                                                  |
| 01:42      | if you're not doing it.                                                                                                                        |
| 01:43      | You know, if you're listening to the show, and you're not on any email, there's a couple                                                       |
| 01:48      | tips we have in here that run real deep, but we've also got some stuff that are just basic                                                     |
| 01:52      | automation apps that can really change your game for email.                                                                                    |
| 01:57      | And I think maybe we start with the process of sending email, and introducing automation                                                       |
| 02:04      | to that.                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 02:06      | Well, I mean, one of the first things I do with email is I look at what I'm doing and                                                          |
| 02:11      | whether or not what I'm doing is actually suited for email, because email is asynchronous.                                                     |
| 02:14      | So there's two kinds of communication, right?                                                                                                  |
| 02:16      | Asynchronous and asynchronous.                                                                                                                 |
| 02:18      | Synchronous is something like you pick up a telephone, you call somebody, as you talk                                                          |
| 02:21      | to them, they reply.                                                                                                                           |
| 02:22      | Whereas asynchronous is you send something, it sits there until they go through and process                                                    |
| 02:26      | their email probably one or two times in a day, maybe three, and then they reply to you.                                                       |
| 02:30      | So if you need a fast response, I don't send it by email.                                                                                      |
| 02:34      | But one of the things that I have done, especially recently, is to set up templates for different                                              |
| 02:41      | kinds of emails I send.                                                                                                                        |
| 02:42      | So this could be inviting somebody to come and be a guest on Automators, or there's certain                                                    |
| 02:48      | documents that I regularly have to send off for work.                                                                                          |
| 02:50      | And I always use the same kind of text with them.                                                                                              |
| 02:54      | So I have set up some email templates.                                                                                                         |
| 02:57      | Some of this is in [[Drafts]].                                                                                                                 |
| 02:58      | Some of this I've done in [[Airmail]] using their templating.                                                                                  |
| 03:02      | And I know, David, you've done some experimenting with this with [[TextExpander]] as well.                                                     |
| 03:05      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                                                       |
| 03:06      | I've gotten deep down the hole.                                                                                                                |
| 03:07      | Also, you can use a shortcut.                                                                                                                  |
| 03:08      | So we've got a lot of ground to cover here.                                                                                                    |
| 03:11      | Are you on [[Airmail]] again, Rose?                                                                                                            |
| 03:13      | I am on [[Airmail]].                                                                                                                           |
| 03:14      | I was not on [[Airmail]] for a little while.                                                                                                   |
| 03:16      | And then I realised that not being on Airmail was actually completely and utterly wrecking                                                     |
| 03:20      | my workflow, because the custom actions and the templates make my life so much easier.                                                         |
| 03:26      | I'm going to talk about both of those today.                                                                                                   |
| 03:27      | But the templates in particular really do make it much easier for me to do things, because                                                     |
| 03:32      | I've created templates inside of [[Airmail]], so I can literally just tap.                                                                     |
| 03:36      | And then in the bar, there's a templates button.                                                                                               |
| 03:39      | And I can just fill in a template and go and I'm done.                                                                                         |
| 03:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 03:43      | And how are they doing in terms of just, I know this is just an aside, but in my experience,                                                   |
| 03:48      | they've always felt like it's like a beta app and just dealing with the little problems                                                        |
| 03:54      | or the things that always chase me away.                                                                                                       |
| 03:55      | But it seems like at some point, they're going to make it more stable and what's your experience                                               |
| 04:01      | so far?                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:02      | I mean, I've been back on air for quite a while now.                                                                                           |
| 04:05      | And I've not had an issue with stability at all.                                                                                               |
| 04:09      | I briefly stopped using it because I was having an issue where emails weren't sending.                                                         |
| 04:15      | And then I realised that that was actually entirely my fault.                                                                                  |
| 04:18      | I set up the [[GPG]] or is it [[PGP]] plug-in and I hadn't set it up correctly, so it was unable                                               |
| 04:27      | to send emails on my Mac.                                                                                                                      |
| 04:29      | So that was entirely user error, so I'm pleased to report that sometimes I can be a little                                                     |
| 04:33      | bit silly, just like everybody else and make mistakes.                                                                                         |
| 04:37      | Well, I think that's like for an automator, Air Mail is a great option because I'm not                                                         |
| 04:42      | aware of really any app that gives you more bells and whistles to automate email than                                                          |
| 04:46      | Air Mail.                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:48      | And the other thing is, you know, there are so many different services it directly integrates                                                  |
| 04:52      | with as well, which makes it super easy.                                                                                                       |
| 04:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:56      | And they're on all the devices, you know, Apple, all the devices in the Apple ecosystem.                                                       |
| 05:00      | So if it's stable, I think that would be a great option.                                                                                       |
| 05:03      | So explain to me how you do templates in [[Airmail]].                                                                                          |
| 05:06      | Well, in [[Airmail]], what you do is you open up a new email and you start typing.                                                             |
| 05:11      | And then you can actually just tap on the template button and create things.                                                                   |
| 05:15      | So I'm just doing one right now where I've just written, Hello, David.                                                                         |
| 05:19      | And then if I tap on templates, then I can create template.                                                                                    |
| 05:22      | And I can call this one David Sparks.                                                                                                          |
| 05:25      | And then when I've done that, next time I tap on templates, I can select David Sparks                                                          |
| 05:30      | as a template, which, you know, makes things really easy.                                                                                      |
| 05:34      | And I can also delete a template if I'm actively using that.                                                                                   |
| 05:38      | So it's very simple and it perhaps sounds, you know, overly simple, but I feel like they                                                       |
| 05:42      | did a great job with this because it means that, you know, you do just open it up and                                                          |
| 05:47      | you type your email.                                                                                                                           |
| 05:48      | And this is the best way I find to do an automation where, you know, you actually do whatever it                                               |
| 05:55      | is that you need to do and then reverse engineer it.                                                                                           |
| 05:57      | So you type your email and you get everything set up and then you can create a template                                                        |
| 06:01      | and you're good.                                                                                                                               |
| 06:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:03      | And that's, that's a great tool for it.                                                                                                        |
| 06:06      | And those templates sync across all of [[Airmail]], right?                                                                                     |
| 06:09      | I mean, you can run them on your Mac as well as your iPhone and iPad.                                                                          |
| 06:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:13      | I pretty much, so it's one of these things.                                                                                                    |
| 06:15      | I have switched to sending email from my phone a lot recently.                                                                                 |
| 06:20      | So I don't remember the last time I actively sent an email on my Mac, but I believe the                                                        |
| 06:25      | templates are in here as well.                                                                                                                 |
| 06:27      | I'm not remembering exactly where on my beta version on my Mac is somewhat out of date,                                                        |
| 06:32      | though this feature has been out for a while, but I think it's in there.                                                                       |
| 06:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:36      | I did an experiment with [[MailMate]], which is a Mac client that is very automation friendly.                                                 |
| 06:42      | And if you want to automate email and you just want to use the Mac as a client, I would                                                        |
| 06:48      | recommend checking that out.                                                                                                                   |
| 06:50      | One of the things [[MailMate]] does is it allows you to create your own key bindings and it's                                                  |
| 06:55      | just a text file in the [[MailMate]] settings.                                                                                                 |
| 06:58      | And if you look, open it up, you can copy and make your own key bindings.                                                                      |
| 07:02      | And that means when you just start typing letters on the screen, really magic can happen                                                       |
| 07:07      | in terms of your email.                                                                                                                        |
| 07:08      | Like, one of the things that I do is the same black hole, right?                                                                               |
| 07:13      | But I have three different email accounts, MacSparky, Legal, and Personal.                                                                     |
| 07:17      | So sending something to the black hole, it needs to go to the right black hole, right?                                                         |
| 07:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:23      | But by customising [[MailMate]] key bindings, I could just type B for black hole and then                                                      |
| 07:28      | I could type M, L, or P for MacSparky, Legal, or Personal.                                                                                     |
| 07:32      | And there's nothing else to do, just B, M, and then it's in the black hole.                                                                    |
| 07:37      | And that is an automation that really makes a lot of sense.                                                                                    |
| 07:40      | The downside to [[MailMate]] is they don't have a mobile client.                                                                               |
| 07:45      | And it's like, if you really want to just crush email on your Mac and largely ignore                                                           |
| 07:50      | it on your mobile devices, I would say that [[MailMate]] is the answer and it is a rock solid                                                  |
| 07:55      | app.                                                                                                                                           |
| 07:56      | I mean, it's not particularly pretty, but I think it's got the reputation of being ugly                                                        |
| 08:00      | when it isn't.                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:01      | I mean, they've really kind of improved it over the years.                                                                                     |
| 08:05      | And in terms of automation, I'm not sure there's anything better.                                                                              |
| 08:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:09      | And of course, the other thing that we should mention is there is no rule saying that you                                                      |
| 08:12      | need to use the same mail client on Mac and iOS.                                                                                               |
| 08:14      | And in fact, sometimes it can be advantageous to use different ones, as we'll talk about                                                       |
| 08:19      | later when we get to the filters, I'm running [[Apple Mail\|Mac mail]], as well as [[Airmail]] on my Mac.                                      |
| 08:24      | And also live update, I just found the template button.                                                                                        |
| 08:26      | It's up next to the save and send and the attachments button right there.                                                                      |
| 08:30      | So it's in a logical place.                                                                                                                    |
| 08:32      | I was just not looking for it because it turns out on a 34-inch ultra-wide monitor, if you                                                     |
| 08:37      | maximise a draft email, then buttons are really far away from the middle of the screen.                                                        |
| 08:42      | Oh my gosh.                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:43      | Putting [[Drafts]] on it.                                                                                                                      |
| 08:44      | Sorry, you mean [[Drafts]] full screen on a monitor?                                                                                           |
| 08:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:50      | So I just clicked on the new mail as a draft and I double-clicked the bar at the top without                                                   |
| 08:54      | thinking.                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:56      | And then it went full screen on me.                                                                                                            |
| 08:57      | So 10.                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:58      | So you're on a 46-inch draft, so I don't think before you do that.                                                                             |
| 09:02      | I love it.                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:03      | I love it, Rose.                                                                                                                               |
| 09:04      | I mean, I do do that with the [[Drafts]] app, but I try not to do that with most other apps.                                                   |
| 09:09      | I think a 46-inch screen is one where you probably should never hit that full screen                                                           |
| 09:15      | button.                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 09:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 09:18      | 34-inch ultra-wide is exactly the same.                                                                                                        |
| 09:19      | Even movies and stuff, they look kind of crazy on this.                                                                                        |
| 09:23      | Is there anything that would make sense to be full screen on a 46-inch screen?                                                                 |
| 09:28      | I just want to know.                                                                                                                           |
| 09:30      | I mean, I have a 34-inch, so not quite that big.                                                                                               |
| 09:34      | So it is smaller, but I mean, sometimes it can be really useful to go full screen.                                                             |
| 09:41      | Usually applications are multi-column.                                                                                                         |
| 09:43      | So I use [[PhpStorm]] a lot for work, and that is great because I can have two different                                                       |
| 09:48      | files open at the same time, but technically it's one app that's full screen.                                                                  |
| 09:54      | But at the same time, that's kind of six of one half a dozen of another.                                                                       |
| 09:59      | I usually use two apps side-by-side or three apps side-by-side.                                                                                |
| 10:02      | I think in some future episodes, we're going to need to do a breakdown of how you and I                                                        |
| 10:06      | manage Windows.                                                                                                                                |
| 10:08      | I think that's kind of an automation tool.                                                                                                     |
| 10:10      | And with that super-wide screen, I'm sure you've got some cool tricks up your sleeve.                                                          |
| 10:14      | So let's put a pin in that one and come back to it someday.                                                                                    |
| 10:17      | But my automation tool for, the most important automation tool for me for composing email                                                      |
| 10:25      | is [[TextExpander]].                                                                                                                           |
| 10:26      | I like it because it works on all platforms.                                                                                                   |
| 10:28      | I mean, full disclosure, they're an occasional sponsor of the show and some of my other shows.                                                 |
| 10:33      | But I started using the app long before they started sponsoring, and I will long after.                                                        |
| 10:40      | Because it's just so ubiquitous.                                                                                                               |
| 10:43      | It shows up everywhere, and it does what I want.                                                                                               |
| 10:45      | A couple of things I like about [[TextExpander]] for writing emails is, one, is you can hard                                                   |
| 10:50      | code the tab key in.                                                                                                                           |
| 10:52      | And what that means is you can write a script that starts in the subject line and writes                                                       |
| 10:57      | the whole email.                                                                                                                               |
| 10:59      | So for example, and I've given this one before, so bear with me if you've heard it.                                                            |
| 11:05      | But like monthly billings, when I do my monthly billings for the law practice, it's an email.                                                  |
| 11:10      | And I just type new bill in the subject line.                                                                                                  |
| 11:14      | And what it does is [[TextExpander]] can grab the current month.                                                                               |
| 11:17      | So it will say January 2021, Sparks law invoice.                                                                                               |
| 11:24      | And then it will hit the tab key.                                                                                                              |
| 11:27      | And then I can run [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] in it.                                                                                        |
| 11:30      | So if I've got the email address to Rosemary Orchard, it'll say Dear Rosemary, because                                                         |
| 11:36      | I use an [[AppleScript]], and that's something I posted at MacSparky too.                                                                      |
| 11:40      | So it just inserts an [[AppleScript]] to put the recipient's name in, then it hits a comma                                                     |
| 11:43      | key and hits a new, and then it hits the, and then it types in the text of here's this                                                         |
| 11:50      | monthly invoice, blah, blah, blah.                                                                                                             |
| 11:53      | And I can do like a fill in field so I can type in the company name if I want or not.                                                          |
| 11:58      | I can also do it as a grab from clipboard.                                                                                                     |
| 12:01      | So like if I just finished the invoice, I could copy the name of the company off of                                                            |
| 12:06      | the invoice, and, and then it would insert the company name in that text just because                                                          |
| 12:12      | it's in my clipboard at the moment.                                                                                                            |
| 12:15      | And the whole thing just, I know it's sound takes me a while to kind of explain walking                                                        |
| 12:20      | through what I'm doing with it.                                                                                                                |
| 12:21      | But once you use [[TextExpander]], this is a tool anybody can use, they've, they've made                                                       |
| 12:25      | it very simple.                                                                                                                                |
| 12:26      | In fact, they just did a UI update on the app to make it even easier to use.                                                                   |
| 12:30      | And you can build email compositions like that.                                                                                                |
| 12:33      | And I've built maybe a hundred of them.                                                                                                        |
| 12:37      | I mean, I have so many of these things, like if somebody is going to post a home screen                                                        |
| 12:41      | on MacSparky, I've got one that does it.                                                                                                       |
| 12:43      | If they, you know, I've got a bunch of different legal scenarios where I send these emails                                                     |
| 12:48      | that are, are pre-generated, you know, setting up a guest for the show and explaining to                                                       |
| 12:52      | them how we record and what they need to do on their end.                                                                                      |
| 12:55      | And all of that stuff, I'm never going to type that over and over again.                                                                       |
| 12:58      | I use automation and [[TextExpander]] lets me move from app to app.                                                                            |
| 13:03      | So if I decide this month I like [[Airmail]], but next month I like [[Apple Mail]] or whatever,                                                |
| 13:08      | that [[TextExpander]] snippet goes with me.                                                                                                    |
| 13:11      | So that's all that is upside for [[TextExpander]] downside is it's not as easy on iPhone and                                                   |
| 13:17      | iPad as I'd like it to be.                                                                                                                     |
| 13:19      | And, you know, Apple just doesn't make it possible for somebody like [[Smile Software\|Smile]] to insert                                       |
| 13:26      | text insertion in any old app they want to, it's part of the security model.                                                                   |
| 13:31      | But using the [[TextExpander]] app on iPhone and iPad, which a lot of people don't realise,                                                    |
| 13:37      | you can run those a lot of more complicated snippets there and then you just block and                                                         |
| 13:40      | copy it in.                                                                                                                                    |
| 13:42      | Or even better, you can insert it into [[Drafts]], which we'll talk about in just a minute.                                                    |
| 13:46      | But that's kind of my big deal is [[TextExpander]].                                                                                            |
| 13:51      | Do you ever do that?                                                                                                                           |
| 13:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:53      | I do.                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:54      | I tend to use [[Drafts]], which is one of the few apps out there nowadays that has support                                                     |
| 13:58      | for the [[TextExpander]] API, which means, you know, obviously on the Mac, you know, it's                                                      |
| 14:04      | just straight up using [[TextExpander]], they, you know, [[Greg Pierce]] didn't write that in.                                                 |
| 14:08      | But on iOS, there's a little setting somewhere and then a refresh button if you wanted to                                                      |
| 14:13      | manually update it where you can connect it to [[TextExpander]] and say, you know, have                                                        |
| 14:19      | all my text expansions for me.                                                                                                                 |
| 14:22      | And [[Drafts]] has some great integration as well.                                                                                             |
| 14:24      | So in templates and so on, you can insert and you can use special tags, which will actually                                                    |
| 14:30      | be snippet abbreviations from [[TextExpander]].                                                                                                |
| 14:33      | Those only work on iOS, but I kind of feel that they are insanely cool because it literally                                                    |
| 14:39      | just goes, oh, hey, and I'm going to grab this thing from [[TextExpander]].                                                                    |
| 14:42      | So there is only one place that you need to maintain that template.                                                                            |
| 14:46      | So that's good.                                                                                                                                |
| 14:47      | Unfortunately, I've heard from some other app developers that the [[TextExpander]] API for                                                     |
| 14:50      | iOS is somewhat out of date a little bit and takes a bit more work to integrate.                                                               |
| 14:55      | So I think some of these app developers may have not particularly known what they were                                                         |
| 14:59      | doing, but others, you know, I'm sure, you know, if [[Greg Pierce]] can integrate it, anybody                                                  |
| 15:04      | can.                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:06      | Not that he can't develop, obviously.                                                                                                          |
| 15:07      | And if you're primarily working on a Mac, I think it's an absolute no-brainer.                                                                 |
| 15:12      | On iOS, you need to run it through their app or something like Drafts, which is not that                                                       |
| 15:16      | big of a deal.                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:17      | But I have found that to be the time I spent building that automation to pay off immensely                                                     |
| 15:23      | over the years.                                                                                                                                |
| 15:25      | And so I'm a really big fan.                                                                                                                   |
| 15:26      | Now, writing email and [[Drafts]] is a separate form of automation.                                                                            |
| 15:30      | And the simplest thing that you can do in [[Drafts]] is just understand that when you write                                                    |
| 15:36      | a new draft, the first line, if you export to email, the first line becomes a subject                                                          |
| 15:40      | line.                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:41      | So writing an email in [[Drafts]] is real easy.                                                                                                |
| 15:44      | So I can make an email that says, you know, "Automator's Planning Call".                                                                       |
| 15:49      | New paragraph.                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:50      | Hi, Rose, comma, new paragraph.                                                                                                                |
| 15:52      | Let's do an Automator's Planning Call.                                                                                                         |
| 15:54      | Now when I go and hit this in the email button, it automatically populates that first line                                                     |
| 15:58      | into the subject line, which is pretty cool.                                                                                                   |
| 16:02      | And just, you know, one way, and then there's all the other tools in [[Drafts]], you know, like                                                |
| 16:07      | Rose was saying, you have templates and other things you can do to make it even more powerful.                                                 |
| 16:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 16:12      | And what I really like is, of course, all the draft stuff works on Mac and iOS as well,                                                        |
| 16:17      | which means that you can have the same workflow.                                                                                               |
| 16:19      | Now on the Mac, there is an extra step.                                                                                                        |
| 16:21      | If you want to be able to convert [[Markdown]] to rich text, there is a special app that                                                       |
| 16:25      | you need to install an extra app called [[Mail Assistant]].                                                                                    |
| 16:30      | And it's a very basic helper application that literally just helps you convert the [[Markdown]]                                                |
| 16:37      | to be able to be sent as [[HTML]] email, so a rich text email.                                                                                 |
| 16:41      | And I've put a link to that in the show notes for anybody who's looking for it, because                                                        |
| 16:45      | it means that you can do this.                                                                                                                 |
| 16:47      | And so I've been experimenting, I've got a little workspace going on of mail templates.                                                        |
| 16:52      | And I've taken the leaf out of my [[OmniFocus]] templates book, or, you know, the [[OmniFocus]]                                                |
| 16:59      | templates that I've been using for years with the French quotation marks, the double chevrons                                                  |
| 17:03      | on each side.                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:04      | Sure.                                                                                                                                          |
| 17:05      | And I've got those as variables.                                                                                                               |
| 17:07      | And so I'm using pretty much the same script that I used for my [[OmniFocus]] templates, where                                                 |
| 17:10      | it pops up and says, hey, what do you want this to be?                                                                                         |
| 17:12      | Hey, what do you want that to be, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.                                                                             |
| 17:16      | And then, you know, fills it all in and then pops it open as an email for me ready to send                                                     |
| 17:22      | it, which works great.                                                                                                                         |
| 17:23      | And all of these are just great ways to automate email creation.                                                                               |
| 17:29      | Another thing you can do is inside an email, maybe there's a typical paragraph you write,                                                      |
| 17:35      | you know, lawyers write disclaimer paragraphs all the time, you know, like, this is not                                                        |
| 17:39      | legal advice, blah, blah, blah, or whatever, you know.                                                                                         |
| 17:43      | And you could do that also with text expansion, either with [[TextExpander]] or even simple text                                               |
| 17:48      | replacement built into the operating system, but that's also a form of automation.                                                             |
| 17:54      | I mean, anytime you find yourself typing something more than once, that's a candidate                                                          |
| 17:57      | for automation.                                                                                                                                |
| 18:00      | Another type of automation I do that is not on the Mac, but on iOS related to email creation                                                   |
| 18:06      | is emails that often accompany other tasks.                                                                                                    |
| 18:10      | Like I do corporate compliance stuff for my business clients.                                                                                  |
| 18:16      | So like once a year, we do minutes and then we do a filing with the secretary of state                                                         |
| 18:21      | and other things.                                                                                                                              |
| 18:22      | So, and when I, when I send a client the email about kicking that process off, that's, that's                                                  |
| 18:28      | largely started out as a [[TextExpander]] snippet, but it makes more sense to me as a shortcut                                                 |
| 18:33      | because there's an email, send email shortcut that you can run in [[Shortcuts]] where I've pasted                                              |
| 18:41      | this stuff in, now I've created variables the same way you kind of do in [[TextExpander]],                                                     |
| 18:46      | but I'm running it out of [[Shortcuts]].                                                                                                       |
| 18:49      | But the advantage of this is that I also create at the same time an [[OmniFocus]] project                                                      |
| 18:54      | related to the creation of those minutes and filing of those things.                                                                           |
| 18:58      | I send a note off to my legal assistant to make sure she's tracking it and then I do,                                                          |
| 19:03      | there's like three or four different items that happen.                                                                                        |
| 19:06      | I also create a [[Ulysses]] document with [[Drafts]].                                                                                          |
| 19:09      | And so a bunch of stuff happens when I send that email off and I realise why not trigger                                                       |
| 19:14      | the whole thing on sending the email.                                                                                                          |
| 19:17      | And then I don't have to make a separate shortcut to run after I sent, you know, historically                                                  |
| 19:21      | I would write the email and then I'd go in and run a shortcut to do all the extra work                                                         |
| 19:25      | and I'm like, oh, I could just tie all this into one step.                                                                                     |
| 19:28      | And so now I send the email via a shortcut.                                                                                                    |
| 19:31      | It's a one step shortcut, send email, very easy to do, but just kind of open your mind                                                         |
| 19:36      | to the thought of, are there emails I send that naturally have other things attached                                                           |
| 19:42      | to them, other work that I do, and is that something I could automate and why not chain                                                        |
| 19:46      | all those together?                                                                                                                            |
| 19:47      | And that really makes you feel like a badass automator because you're like doing all this                                                      |
| 19:52      | stuff with one step.                                                                                                                           |
| 19:54      | And because I'm creating variables with this email, like the client name, the company name,                                                    |
| 19:59      | that can also be used to fill in those variables in an [[OmniFocus]] script or [[Ulysses]] document.                                           |
| 20:06      | So I'm only putting the name in once and it's showing up all over my system.                                                                   |
| 20:10      | Yeah, that's great.                                                                                                                            |
| 20:12      | I actually have a shortcut, I think I've mentioned it before, where it's when I email in sick                                                  |
| 20:18      | at work.                                                                                                                                       |
| 20:19      | And basically, I just fire it up, but I ask me, hey, are you just sick today?                                                                  |
| 20:24      | Are you sick?                                                                                                                                  |
| 20:25      | Are you going to the doctor?                                                                                                                   |
| 20:26      | Because if I'm going to the doctor, I'm getting a sick note, then they'll tell me how long                                                     |
| 20:29      | I've been off for or, hey, I've been to the doctor and I've got a sick note and I'm going                                                      |
| 20:33      | to be sick for X period of time.                                                                                                               |
| 20:36      | And then, of course, I have also, hey, I'm back at work and I'm not sick anymore.                                                              |
| 20:43      | And this is just a menu with send mail actions inside of it, but it means that I will always                                                   |
| 20:47      | send it to the right email address and I wrote it when I was feeling well.                                                                     |
| 20:52      | So it's correctly, you know, grammar, correct grammar and things like that.                                                                    |
| 20:57      | She says managing to mess up the grammar as she's speaking, but it does make my life much                                                      |
| 21:02      | easier and also when I send an email to say that I'm in sick or I'm off sick, then it                                                          |
| 21:08      | adds a task to my [[OmniFocus]] inbox, which says, hey, send an email to say that you're back                                                  |
| 21:13      | in the office.                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:14      | It doesn't have a due date, but it is flagged and tagged with work just so that I know,                                                        |
| 21:18      | you know, when I'm back at work, hey, this is important and I should do it, which, you                                                         |
| 21:22      | know, makes my life a bit easier.                                                                                                              |
| 21:23      | So.                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:24      | And the thing I like about all of this is there's just so many ways to automate sending                                                        |
| 21:28      | an email.                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:29      | You know?                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:31      | We don't have windows.                                                                                                                         |
| 21:32      | We didn't talk about it, but I mean, [[TextExpander]] is on windows.                                                                           |
| 21:34      | So a lot of these tools work cross-platform and there are solutions wherever you go.                                                           |
| 21:41      | And the real culprit that you should be attacking with your automation prowess is repeat emails                                                |
| 21:47      | and we all send them.                                                                                                                          |
| 21:48      | There are things that related to the work we do or maybe you run a Cub Scout pack or                                                           |
| 21:53      | whatever where you're sending similar emails all the time and automate that, you know,                                                         |
| 21:59      | save yourself the time.                                                                                                                        |
| 22:00      | You're listening to this show.                                                                                                                 |
| 22:01      | This is something you can do today.                                                                                                            |
| 22:03      | Absolutely.                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:04      | And that's the thing.                                                                                                                          |
| 22:05      | Even if you just copy and paste an existing email that you've already got and you instead                                                      |
| 22:09      | use an ask for input action in a shortcut that just asks you for a date and then it                                                            |
| 22:13      | formats the date correctly and paste it into the email, you're good to go.                                                                     |

| 22:58      | Let DEVONthink automatically organise your data with rules you define.                                                                         |

| 23:06      | There's no part of DEVONthink that can't be automated, so you can extend DEVONthink's                                                          |
| 23:10      | functionality with your own commands by adding them to its scripts menu.                                                                       |
| 23:14      | Even templates can have scripts inside them and you can set new documents up with placeholders                                                 |
| 23:19      | and of course your own AppleScript code too.                                                                                                   |

| 23:31      | Personally, I absolutely love the smart rules.                                                                                                 |
| 23:34      | It's like having Hazel but a little bit more on steroids because my DEVONthink database                                                        |
| 23:39      | goes everywhere with me.                                                                                                                       |
| 23:41      | If you've got a ton of documents to manage, especially if maybe you haven't quite kept                                                         |
| 23:45      | up with things in recent times as maybe you ought to have, then DEVONthink is definitely                                                       |

| 24:09      | Our thanks to DEVONtechnologies for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                                                            |
| 24:13      | All right, so we've talked about sending email.                                                                                                |
| 24:18      | Let's talk a little bit about email filters and managing the inbox.                                                                            |
| 24:23      | So this is something that A, I do a lot of and B, I need to do a much better job of because                                                    |
| 24:29      | I went back to work very recently after a long break for Christmas, David.                                                                     |
| 24:34      | And guess what?                                                                                                                                |
| 24:35      | I had 672 unread emails in my inbox.                                                                                                           |
| 24:40      | Wow.                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:41      | And that's in my inbox, okay.                                                                                                                  |
| 24:43      | And then in the folders where I have things filtered out, I had thousands because of course                                                    |
| 24:49      | I have stuff running that's automated, but it turns out that I haven't set up filters                                                          |
| 24:53      | for a whole bunch of email that I really need to set up filters for.                                                                           |
| 24:57      | So I've gone through and I identified them and I spent a good chunk of today actually                                                          |
| 25:00      | creating email filters, which sounds like an particularly useful thing to do, but it                                                           |
| 25:06      | absolutely is because it means that next time I take a break from work, I won't come back                                                      |
| 25:09      | to 600 unread emails in my inbox.                                                                                                              |
| 25:11      | I think the overall strategy for email filters, no matter what system you're using, whether                                                    |
| 25:16      | you're in Gmail, Apple Mail, or whatever, is to make them as you need them.                                                                    |
| 25:21      | I wouldn't recommend spending three days creating email filters, but what I would do is like                                                   |
| 25:27      | an email comes in and just be aware of, hey, I can make this so this doesn't happen again                                                      |
| 25:32      | and just smack the flies as they show up, and I think that's a much more saving way                                                            |
| 25:41      | to kind of deal with it.                                                                                                                       |
| 25:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:44      | And the other thing is, of course, if you try and anticipate in advance, then something's                                                      |
| 25:47      | going to go wrong because the way email filters work is they're dependent on things like the                                                   |
| 25:51      | sender and the subject and stuff like that.                                                                                                    |
| 25:54      | And so somebody starts spelling automators with an extra O in it, then your filter for                                                         |
| 25:59      | automators isn't going to work.                                                                                                                |
| 26:02      | But one of my personal philosophies is try to do as much filtering on the server as possible.                                                  |
| 26:09      | So that means on Google servers, if you're using [[Gmail]] or Microsoft servers or your                                                        |
| 26:15      | [[Microsoft Exchange\|Exchange]] server, if you're using [[Microsoft Exchange\|Exchange]] or [[Microsoft Outlook\|Outlook]], things like that. |
| 26:21      | Just because this way, wherever you then check your email, that filtering has already happened.                                                |
| 26:26      | And that's where things like [[SaneBox]] and so on can play in really nicely as well.                                                          |
| 26:30      | Because it does just work for all of this stuff because it intercepts it before you                                                            |
| 26:35      | see it, or at least ideally it does.                                                                                                           |
| 26:37      | Yeah, I mean, one of the best ways to improve automation sometimes is just to throw money                                                      |
| 26:41      | at it.                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:42      | And SaneBox is a paid service, which once again is an occasional sponsor.                                                                      |
| 26:47      | But they're really great.                                                                                                                      |
| 26:50      | And the way it works is it looks at your email.                                                                                                |
| 26:54      | You give it permission to look at your email, but it doesn't look at the body text or email.                                                   |
| 26:58      | It looks at the recipient and the subject line.                                                                                                |
| 27:03      | And it uses its algorithm to figure out, is that something that's important to you or                                                          |
| 27:08      | not important to you?                                                                                                                          |
| 27:09      | And it's spooky how good it is.                                                                                                                |
| 27:12      | I've been using [[SaneBox]] for years.                                                                                                         |
| 27:14      | And it just seems to know pretty quickly.                                                                                                      |
| 27:18      | And the stuff that it doesn't think is super important to you, it puts in a folder called                                                      |
| 27:22      | SaneLater.                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:23      | So it's an automation that's happening without your effort.                                                                                    |
| 27:27      | And so instead of waking up and finding 100 email in your inbox, there'll be like 10 email                                                     |
| 27:34      | in your inbox and 90 email in your 'SaneLater' box.                                                                                            |
| 27:38      | And then you can slice the onion further.                                                                                                      |
| 27:40      | They've got a way to have it look for newsletters and a way to have it look for advertisements.                                                |
| 27:45      | And it can separate all that stuff out for you.                                                                                                |
| 27:48      | So ultimately, I've got some 'SaneBoxes' that I check once a week and is largely an exercise                                                   |
| 27:56      | in deletion.                                                                                                                                   |
| 27:57      | And then I've got other ones that I check daily and it all just kind of works without forcing                                                  |
| 28:02      | me to be the one to go through and do all that filtering, which is just, you know, it's                                                        |
| 28:07      | amazing to have something, it's almost like having an assistant that just does it for                                                          |
| 28:11      | you.                                                                                                                                           |
| 28:12      | And it's kind of great.                                                                                                                        |
| 28:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:14      | That's the thing.                                                                                                                              |
| 28:15      | And, you know, as you said, sometimes the easiest solution is sort of money at it.                                                             |
| 28:19      | And I absolutely approve of that.                                                                                                              |
| 28:21      | Unfortunately, I have way too many email inboxes to pay for [[SaneBox]] for everything, you know,                                              |
| 28:26      | between ones for different apps and stuff like that, it would get quite pricey quite                                                           |
| 28:30      | quickly.                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:31      | But, you know, it's a valid solution for the primary mailbox.                                                                                  |
| 28:35      | And then the next thing I do is I usually have a look in, I tend to use G Suite as my                                                          |
| 28:42      | back end just because I'm very familiar with it.                                                                                               |
| 28:44      | And I know that its filters are insanely powerful.                                                                                             |
| 28:48      | They have a whole bunch of things.                                                                                                             |
| 28:50      | And the syntax for it is very similar to the syntax that you can use if you search using                                                       |
| 28:54      | the mail app on your Mac, so from colon email address, et cetera.                                                                              |
| 28:59      | So you can do a search and then you can create a filter from that.                                                                             |
| 29:02      | And that is great.                                                                                                                             |
| 29:03      | And I have filters for all sorts of things.                                                                                                    |
| 29:07      | And, you know, for anything that I don't want in my inbox, I just mark it as red and trash                                                     |
| 29:10      | it or, you know, mark it as red and archive it or mark it as red and add a particular                                                          |
| 29:16      | tag and archive it, depending on what things are.                                                                                              |
| 29:19      | And I'm sure somebody is going to send me an email and say, hey, Rose, if you're just                                                          |
| 29:22      | trashing it, why don't you unsubscribe from it?                                                                                                |
| 29:25      | The answer is I can't.                                                                                                                         |
| 29:28      | It's a system set up by my server, which I need to go through and fix on the other side                                                        |
| 29:32      | of things.                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:33      | But right now, all the cron jobs are just sent to me by email.                                                                                 |
| 29:35      | And if everything's fine, I don't care about it, you know, past 30 days.                                                                       |
| 29:39      | So I just trash it because then I have a 30-day history and then it gets nuked, which works                                                    |
| 29:43      | quite nicely.                                                                                                                                  |
| 29:46      | So yeah, I do that.                                                                                                                            |
| 29:48      | But sometimes I don't want email to be handled when it comes in.                                                                               |
| 29:51      | I want emails to be handled after I've read it or, you know, or a day after I've received                                                      |
| 29:58      | it and read it and things like that.                                                                                                           |
| 30:00      | And for that, I have a couple of different approaches, which, one of which I've already                                                        |
| 30:04      | mentioned, which is [[Airmail]] custom actions, which is on iOS.                                                                               |
| 30:07      | So [[Airmail]] custom actions on iOS allow you to create a custom button, which appears                                                        |
| 30:12      | on the right-hand menu, which can do different things.                                                                                         |
| 30:15      | So for example, it can mark it as red and put it in a folder or it could forward it                                                            |
| 30:20      | to, for example, [[Tripit]].                                                                                                                   |
| 30:23      | That was one I used a lot.                                                                                                                     |
| 30:24      | I would add the travel label forward it to [[Tripit]] and archive the email.                                                                   |
| 30:29      | And this was great for my travel bookings when I traveled, which, you know, hasn't happened                                                    |
| 30:33      | in a while.                                                                                                                                    |
| 30:34      | But, you know, the action is still there for me.                                                                                               |
| 30:38      | And I have some other things which will tag things as automators and archive it or tag                                                         |
| 30:43      | it as automators and add it to [[OmniFocus]] and archive it.                                                                                   |
| 30:48      | It's them from [[OmniFocus]], I can jump back to that if I need it for reference and things                                                    |
| 30:52      | like that.                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:53      | So those work really well.                                                                                                                     |
| 30:55      | But I think what really works nicely for me is something I mentioned in our 12 days of                                                         |
| 30:59      | automation with the deliveries, which I've had a couple of people ask me about, is the                                                         |
| 31:06      | mail app can run rules.                                                                                                                        |
| 31:08      | So I have the mail app fire up around about two o'clock in the morning on my Mac mini.                                                         |
| 31:12      | Okay.                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:13      | So my Mac mini is always on.                                                                                                                   |
| 31:14      | So it fires up at two o'clock in the morning, thanks to [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                  |
| 31:18      | And then I just give it 10 minutes just because why not?                                                                                       |
| 31:20      | It's two o'clock in the morning.                                                                                                               |
| 31:22      | I'm not using my Mac or it should be asleep.                                                                                                   |
| 31:25      | So this means that it's caught up to date on all the accounts.                                                                                 |
| 31:28      | And then it selects all the emails in my inbox and then it runs my rules on them.                                                              |
| 31:33      | And these rules are designed for emails that have been read.                                                                                   |
| 31:37      | So for example, if I've read an Amazon dispatch notice, it'll delete it.                                                                       |
| 31:43      | Or if I've read a newsletter, it will archive it.                                                                                              |
| 31:48      | Things like that.                                                                                                                              |
| 31:49      | And basically it means that if I don't do a great job of cleaning up my inbox as I go                                                          |
| 31:53      | about my day, maybe because I just use the notification on my phone when an email comes                                                        |
| 32:00      | in and I long press on it.                                                                                                                     |
| 32:02      | And then I tap markers read or something because I'm fine.                                                                                     |
| 32:05      | That's been received.                                                                                                                          |
| 32:06      | It gets cleared out, which then helps me go from a very full inbox of read emails to                                                           |
| 32:12      | a considerably less full inbox, which is predominantly unread emails.                                                                          |
| 32:17      | And I need to go through and then probably handle those read emails manually, which is                                                         |
| 32:21      | something I like to do in the morning.                                                                                                         |
| 32:22      | I go through and process my inbox after I've started my workday, just to make sure that                                                        |
| 32:27      | I'm on top of things.                                                                                                                          |
| 32:29      | But that works super well for me.                                                                                                              |
| 32:31      | I feel like there's nothing more indicative of the differences between Apple and Google                                                        |
| 32:36      | than the pluses and minuses in the way they handle mail.                                                                                       |
| 32:39      | Like Google has amazing online rule support and I mean, it's not even that Apple doesn't                                                       |
| 32:47      | hold a candle to it.                                                                                                                           |
| 32:48      | Apple's not even in the game for online.                                                                                                       |
| 32:51      | They have like three rules you can apply online.                                                                                               |
| 32:53      | It's crazy how little you can do, whereas Google has an amazing rule set.                                                                      |
| 32:58      | So Rose can add those rules to her [[Gmail]] account and they apply everywhere and it happens on                                               |
| 33:03      | the server before she sees the email.                                                                                                          |
| 33:06      | Whereas Apple, the [[Apple Mail]] has almost no cloud support, but it has a very secure mail                                                   |
| 33:13      | application and it has an insane amount of automation on device.                                                                               |
| 33:19      | Like that those [[Apple Mail]] rules, if you've never looked at them, I recommend you go into                                                  |
| 33:24      | [[Apple Mail]] on a Mac, even if you don't use [[Apple Mail]], just go in and look at all of                                                   |
| 33:28      | the ways you can slice and dice email.                                                                                                         |
| 33:32      | And I don't think even the [[Gmail]] online rules can hold a candle to what you can do with                                                    |
| 33:37      | mail on your Mac.                                                                                                                              |
| 33:38      | I mean, I don't know.                                                                                                                          |
| 33:39      | I haven't spent a lot of time with [[Gmail]] lately, but I mean, it seems like the [[Apple Mail]]                                              |
| 33:43      | rules are crazy powerful.                                                                                                                      |
| 33:45      | They are.                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:46      | They are.                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:47      | And there's so much that you can do and it's one of those things that, you know, it's just                                                     |
| 33:51      | a very different approach to handling things because, you know, do you want to handle before                                                   |
| 33:57      | you see it or are you okay with it being handled maybe as you're processing it?                                                                |
| 34:02      | One rule, which I'll just tell everybody about because I think it's if you use [[Apple Mail]],                                                 |
| 34:06      | then you should do this night.                                                                                                                 |
| 34:08      | I do use [[Apple Mail]] for work, and that is I use VIPs, okay?                                                                                |
| 34:12      | So certain people are marked as VIPs.                                                                                                          |
| 34:15      | And then what I do is I have [[Apple Mail]], whenever an email comes in from a VIP, I have it marked                                           |
| 34:19      | in blue.                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:22      | And this just means that when I scan my inbox, I can immediately see, hey, these emails                                                        |
| 34:27      | are blue.                                                                                                                                      |
| 34:28      | That means that they're from somebody who's very important, and I should make sure I reply                                                     |
| 34:31      | to that fast.                                                                                                                                  |
| 34:35      | And that, you know, there's an example, news from Apple rule, which is shipped for free                                                        |
| 34:39      | on every Mac.                                                                                                                                  |
| 34:41      | But as you go through and add the rules, it is very Hazel-like in all the different things.                                                    |
| 34:47      | I mean, I think [[Hazel]] was probably based on the Mac Mail rules originally at some point                                                    |
| 34:52      | because this is, you know, the same way smart folders work.                                                                                    |
| 34:55      | This, you know, you have your different inputs.                                                                                                |
| 34:59      | And you can also have your edit header list, so you can, you know, go through and have                                                         |
| 35:02      | specific email headers and things like that.                                                                                                   |
| 35:06      | But you can have things ascent with this particular priority.                                                                                  |
| 35:09      | You can apply your rules to all accounts or just some accounts.                                                                                |
| 35:13      | And this is what I really like as well.                                                                                                        |
| 35:14      | I don't have to duplicate rules across accounts.                                                                                               |
| 35:17      | I can, you know, have that rule apply to all accounts, or I can say, you know, account                                                         |
| 35:23      | is [[Microsoft Exchange\|Exchange]], for example, for my [[Microsoft Exchange\|Exchange]] account and things like that.                        |
| 35:28      | So that, that works really, really well for me.                                                                                                |
| 35:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:31      | I mean, there's just a lot there for automation.                                                                                               |
| 35:33      | If you want, if you want to have very granular control, like, like something like [[SaneBox]]                                                  |
| 35:39      | just does it for you and it, you know, it, it, it does the work.                                                                               |
| 35:43      | Like I, one of my [[SaneBox]] folders is feedback.                                                                                             |
| 35:46      | And I don't even know how it figures it out, but generally people that want feedback on                                                        |
| 35:49      | something I'm working on, goes into that folder, I'm not sure.                                                                                 |
| 35:52      | It's not like the word feedback is necessarily there, but, but it's not always right.                                                          |
| 35:58      | Whereas with [[Apple Mail]] rules, you can be very specific.                                                                                   |
| 36:01      | If I get an email from Rosemary Orchard, you know, that contains the word feedback in the                                                      |
| 36:06      | subject line, then, you know, do all these magic tricks to it.                                                                                 |
| 36:10      | And that's the kind of stuff you can do with [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                   |
| 36:14      | You can also do, we've talked about online stuff before, but like [[Zapier]] is another way                                                    |
| 36:19      | to kind of manage email.                                                                                                                       |
| 36:23      | How are you using [[Zapier]] for email automation?                                                                                             |
| 36:25      | Well, what I'm doing with [[Zapier]] is I am forwarding certain emails to them from [[Gmail]].                                                 |
| 36:32      | So [[Google G-Suite\|G Suite]] forward some to me, forward some to [[Zapier]] for me.                                                          |
| 36:36      | And therefore I did two specific email addresses at [[Zapier]].                                                                                |
| 36:40      | And what [[Zapier]] can do is it can parse certain things out.                                                                                 |
| 36:44      | So say, for example, one of them that I have it do is it parses out all of my Amazon orders.                                                   |
| 36:49      | So whenever I order something from Amazon, then I have it bounced, which is [[Zapier]] for                                                     |
| 36:54      | me.                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:55      | Bouncing is the wrong word.                                                                                                                    |
| 36:56      | That's a specific email term.                                                                                                                  |
| 36:57      | But I have it forwarded to [[Zapier]] for me automatically.                                                                                    |
| 36:59      | And [[Zapier]] parses out how much I've spent and then adds it to a [[CSV]] file for me so that                                                |
| 37:06      | I can then add this to you need a budget later.                                                                                                |
| 37:09      | Because that, you know, that means I have one easy place and then I'm working on adding                                                        |
| 37:14      | a few more.                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:15      | Because it can go through and it can parse out using regular expressions, that email,                                                          |
| 37:19      | then it can tell me, you know, that I've spent this much money on Amazon, and then I can                                                       |
| 37:24      | match that up with my credit card statement to make sure everything matches and I'm all                                                        |
| 37:27      | good.                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:28      | And that really is great because it means that when Amazon charged me the wrong price                                                          |
| 37:31      | or something, because they hadn't applied a voucher for some reason, I think maybe the                                                         |
| 37:36      | vouchers terms weren't quite met.                                                                                                              |
| 37:38      | But the way it was written implied that they were, I contacted Amazon customer support and                                                     |
| 37:42      | I got my 20% refunded, so that was good.                                                                                                       |
| 37:45      | You know, there's another platform for email that came out last year called [hey.com](https://hey.com) from                                    |
| 37:51      | the [[Basecamp]] people.                                                                                                                       |
| 37:52      | And it's a very opinionated take on email, but I've been running one of my email accounts                                                      |
| 37:56      | through it just to kind of see it.                                                                                                             |
| 37:58      | And I talk about this stuff.                                                                                                                   |
| 37:59      | I want to be familiar with everything.                                                                                                         |
| 38:00      | And I have to tell you, the more I use it, the more I kind of get it and like what they're                                                     |
| 38:06      | doing.                                                                                                                                         |
| 38:09      | One of the things [[Hey]] does is whenever you get, they have a thing they call the screener.                                                  |
| 38:14      | So every new email you get that you've never received anything from that person before,                                                        |
| 38:18      | they ask you up front, do you ever want to see these emails or not?                                                                            |
| 38:22      | So you can very quickly, you can click, you know, it's a thumbs up or a thumbs down.                                                           |
| 38:26      | If you click thumbs down, it's basically like the same black hole.                                                                             |
| 38:29      | You just don't see the email from them.                                                                                                        |
| 38:31      | But it forces you to do that the first time the person or entity contacts you.                                                                 |
| 38:36      | And it's really great just like knocking out groups of people that, you know, send you                                                         |
| 38:42      | marketing stuff or whatever that you just don't want to see.                                                                                   |
| 38:45      | And then they've got a more limited version of the same filters in the sense they've got,                                                      |
| 38:52      | you can have something go to your inbox, which they call inbox.                                                                                |
| 38:55      | I'm not a big fan of that, but anyway, the name at least.                                                                                      |
| 39:00      | And then they've got one called the feed, which is kind of like newsletter advertisement                                                       |
| 39:05      | stuff that you want to see and one called paper trail, which is the place you would                                                            |
| 39:09      | put like Amazon orders and receipts for things you buy and whatnot, and you just keep them                                                     |
| 39:14      | in there.                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:15      | So that's an automation.                                                                                                                       |
| 39:16      | Once you tell it, things that come from Amazon go into the paper trail, then you just don't                                                    |
| 39:21      | see them anymore and they, you can go look them up if you ever need them, which is a                                                           |
| 39:25      | form of automation.                                                                                                                            |
| 39:27      | Another thing they do that's kind of automation friendly is they have what they call labels,                                                   |
| 39:31      | which is very similar to what [[Gmail]] does, but this is a private service.                                                                   |
| 39:38      | It's not being, they're not studying you.                                                                                                      |
| 39:42      | And the labels, you can either manually apply or you can attach them to particular senders.                                                    |
| 39:49      | So like if you've got a client, you could say, anything that comes from this client                                                            |
| 39:55      | gets the label for that company that that client is part of and just everything is automatically                                               |
| 40:00      | under that label in the future.                                                                                                                |
| 40:02      | You can search the label.                                                                                                                      |
| 40:04      | I think that's very clever and it's an automated form of tagging, which we haven't really talked                                               |
| 40:07      | about today because there, there aren't a lot of really good solutions for tagging email,                                                      |
| 40:11      | which I think can be a very useful tool.                                                                                                       |
| 40:13      | I mean, [[Gmail]] does it well, [[Apple Mail]] can do it if you get the third party mail tags                                                  |
| 40:18      | add on, but then every year you've got to wonder if that's going to get updated and                                                            |
| 40:21      | continue to work or not.                                                                                                                       |
| 40:23      | Where this is just built into the system and I find that, that very reassuring and then                                                        |
| 40:27      | of course you can apply the tags and see them on all platforms, which you can't do                                                             |
| 40:32      | really with [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                                                    |
| 40:34      | So you know, it just got some nice automation stuff in there.                                                                                  |
| 40:39      | It's not as automation friendly as other things because it's not as addressable, like you                                                      |
| 40:44      | couldn't write a draft email and just send it to, [[Hey]], to my knowledge to compose one,                                                     |
| 40:50      | but you could run like a [[TextExpander]] snippet or a keyboard shortcut.                                                                      |
| 40:53      | So it's, it's got some automation stuff to it, but it's, it's non-traditional automation                                                       |
| 40:59      | just like it's a non-traditional email client, but you can find ways to automate.                                                              |
| 41:04      | I guess my point is you can find ways to automate any email really if you want.                                                                |
| 41:08      | Absolutely.                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:09      | It's, it's always doable and that's the thing.                                                                                                 |
| 41:11      | And I kind of feel sometimes like the correct thing with my email to do is to go through                                                       |
| 41:15      | and just bulk unsubscribe to things.                                                                                                           |
| 41:18      | And one of the ways I found actually to do that is an app called [[Cleanfox]] on iOS where                                                     |
| 41:23      | it works as a mail client basically and it just goes through and finds things and helps                                                        |
| 41:27      | you unsubscribe from stuff.                                                                                                                    |
| 41:28      | Of course, there's a bunch of different ways of doing that too, but that's what I'm currently                                                  |
| 41:32      | in the process of doing, literally going through and attempting to burn it down to the ground                                                  |
| 41:36      | without actually just deleting my email address and starting over because that would be a                                                      |
| 41:40      | bad idea.                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:41      | I have a mailbox in [[Apple Mail]] that it's a smart mailbox, which is, we haven't mentioned,                                                  |
| 41:46      | which is another great automation tool, but it searches my mail for anything, any email                                                        |
| 41:51      | that includes the word unsubscribe and it puts it into a smart email box.                                                                      |
| 41:57      | And so I can look at anything I've received in the last three days that has the word unsubscribe                                               |
| 42:00      | in it and then I can go through and easily unsubscribe.                                                                                        |
| 42:04      | But that's harrowing too, because if it's like, you know, there's like unsubscribe from                                                        |
| 42:09      | a reputable vendor that you've bought things from, then there's unsubscribe on the bottom                                                      |
| 42:13      | of an email that you never asked for.                                                                                                          |
| 42:16      | And you press that button and then the bad guys say, hey there's a live person here.                                                           |
| 42:20      | It's in the more email, you know, it's like, there's so many people out there that are                                                         |
| 42:24      | just so crooked over the way they handle email.                                                                                                |
| 42:28      | You have to look at that unsubscribe button with an eyebrow raised, unfortunately.                                                             |
| 42:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:34      | Unfortunately you do because, you know, that's, that's unfortunately the flip side of email.                                                   |
| 42:38      | It can be great and it can be terrible too.                                                                                                    |
| 42:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:42      | Well, I mean, it's just, it's a question of your attention.                                                                                    |
| 42:43      | Your attention is so important and everybody wants to steal it.                                                                                |
| 42:47      | And if you're dealing with people who are not respectful of your attention, then, you                                                          |
| 42:51      | know, they're actually harder to get rid of than you think.                                                                                    |
| 42:54      | That's where things like the same box black hole or the, hey, you know, filtering system                                                       |
| 42:59      | can come in handy or like what Rose does where she just says an auto delete rule.                                                              |
| 43:03      | I mean, you can do this a lot of ways.                                                                                                         |
| 43:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:07      | Uh, mail merge real quick.                                                                                                                     |
| 43:09      | Um, are you doing mail merge?                                                                                                                  |
| 43:11      | I haven't done it for a while, so I don't really have any good automation work.                                                                |
| 43:14      | So, I mean, the way I'm doing mail merge is mostly my mail templates rather than, you                                                          |
| 43:18      | know, mail merge in the sense that it was originally used because I've never needed                                                            |
| 43:22      | to send the same email to, you know, a bunch of people at the same time, um, at least not                                                      |
| 43:30      | unless there was a service that was, you know, offering it for me.                                                                             |
| 43:32      | So when we did the automators meet up at [[WWDC]], you know, in 2019, um, you know, when, when                                                 |
| 43:39      | we, we updated that we emailed everybody, um, and, you know, it, it sent that out, but                                                         |
| 43:44      | that's because, you know, the system was able to do that.                                                                                      |
| 43:47      | And so I try to avoid mail merge because it often feels a little bit spammy, um, to an                                                         |
| 43:54      | extent, but, um, I mean, I'm just using my templates basically, um, that, that's how                                                           |
| 43:59      | I do it.                                                                                                                                       |
| 44:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:01      | Me too.                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:02      | I mean, and it's unreliable and I know there's apps out there for it and I guess there's                                                       |
| 44:07      | a use for it in some cases, but I mean the, the places where I would need it, I don't                                                          |
| 44:13      | use it.                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:14      | Like I, I have a newsletter and I'm really proud of it, but that is as it run through                                                          |
| 44:19      | a vendor that does all of that for me and I don't, you know, see the recipients necessarily.                                                   |
| 44:25      | And then, uh, like when I issue a new field guide and I send, um, emails out to some friends                                                   |
| 44:31      | that I'd like to let them check it out for me and see what they think of it.                                                                   |
| 44:35      | I don't do that as a mail merge, but I do have, I do create kind of like a script                                                              |
| 44:39      | to write that email.                                                                                                                           |
| 44:41      | And then I just go through and create, you know, new emails and insert the script.                                                             |
| 44:44      | So there's just not a lot of, um, issues where I want it though.                                                                               |
| 44:49      | The one I was here about it on is the holiday card stuff where they want to use mail merge                                                     |
| 44:54      | to create mailing labels.                                                                                                                      |
| 44:57      | That's kind of not what we're talking about today.                                                                                             |
| 44:58      | Maybe someday we'll take that on, but it's, it's kind of a different problem.                                                                  |
| 45:04      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Sync Up, a OneDrive podcast.                                                                   |
| 45:08      | I love finding new podcasts to listen to.                                                                                                      |
| 45:10      | It's always great finding a new co-host and an interesting topic.                                                                              |
| 45:13      | And guess what?                                                                                                                                |
| 45:14      | There's more out there.                                                                                                                        |
| 45:16      | If you're looking for a new show to listen to, Sync Up takes you behind the scenes of                                                          |
| 45:19      | OneDrive so you can learn about how to connect files, share your documents and work from                                                       |
| 45:23      | anywhere.                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:24      | And you'll get to hear about the design and development side of things too.                                                                    |
| 45:28      | Each show covers a dedicated topic, guest interviews, news and announcements, plus a special                                                   |
| 45:32      | topic outside of the technology norm.                                                                                                          |
| 45:35      | Topics include data compliance and governance, data security and mobile productivity.                                                          |
| 45:40      | That's one of my favourites.                                                                                                                   |
| 45:42      | Last month they had a great episode recapping 2020 and looking forward to 2021.                                                                |
| 45:46      | I actually really liked their off-topic section where Jason talked about his No Meetings                                                       |
| 45:50      | Friday policy.                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:52      | It really shows you how different people look at productivity differently as well as how                                                       |
| 45:56      | they use their technology.                                                                                                                     |
| 45:58      | Go and listen to it now.                                                                                                                       |

| 46:13      | Hey, something that has become a form of communication the last year, more than ever, is video messages                                        |
| 46:21      | or video meetings.                                                                                                                             |
| 46:24      | I love and hate these, David.                                                                                                                  |
| 46:26      | A number of times where I've had to add a reminder in my calendar to change into something                                                     |
| 46:31      | slightly more work appropriate because I threw my dressing gown over whatever I was wearing                                                    |
| 46:36      | because it was a little bit chilly while I was waiting for my office to heat up and                                                            |
| 46:39      | then I was snuggly and turns out dressing gowns aren't quite meeting appropriate.                                                              |
| 46:43      | Even if you're wearing them over clothing, yeah, video meetings.                                                                               |
| 46:48      | Love and hate.                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:49      | Yeah, that's a good idea and thought about that.                                                                                               |
| 46:52      | Just setting the meeting, I don't have a lot of automation I do here, but [[Fantastical]]                                                            |
| 46:55      | has a cool feature where you add a meeting to your calendar event and it creates a join                                                    |
| 47:02      | button on your calendar event so you just press the button and it goes in, which is                                                            |
| 47:05      | a form of automation and they support [[Zoom]] and Microsoft and all the usual culprits,                                                           |
| 47:12      | but I hadn't really thought about doing prep for video calls as an automation technique.                                                       |
| 47:19      | Are you doing anything like that so you don't wear your dressing gown on camera?                                                               |
| 47:22      | I am.                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:23      | Yeah, so I just have a shortcut and it goes through and it finds meetings in the next                                                          |
| 47:28      | week on my calendar and asks me to pick, so it just shows me a choose from list with a                                                         |
| 47:34      | multiple select option and then for each of those, it just adds a reminder half an hour                                                        |
| 47:40      | before to get ready for this meeting.                                                                                                          |
| 47:43      | When I say get ready for, I'm not talking about the content, I'm talking about the appearance                                                  |
| 47:47      | of how I look and so this is also useful for things like iOS today where I'm actually going                                                    |
| 47:53      | to be on camera and it would be nice if I look nice when I'm on camera so that when                                                            |
| 47:58      | people see me, then I look as enthusiastic as I feel and that is helpful.                                                                      |
| 48:04      | So I just have a little shortcut that I run on Monday morning that just tells me what                                                          |
| 48:08      | do you need to look professional for this week, select these things, hit done, go for                                                          |
| 48:12      | it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:13      | Yeah, we've talked about meetings on automators before and the stuff I said there about physical                                               |
| 48:20      | meetings is still true, like I plan with a shortcut script, I add time blocks before                                                           |
| 48:30      | and after meetings so I can have time to prep for them and time afterwards to record what                                                      |
| 48:36      | happened and make plans and the only thing that's affected me is when I make that prep                                                         |
| 48:42      | time now, if it's the first video call of the day, I add extra time to make sure I have                                                        |
| 48:47      | the backdrops hit up and maybe shave, whatever.                                                                                                |
| 48:51      | So I do add extra time but I don't really address it specifically, but it's something                                                          |
| 48:58      | to be aware of.                                                                                                                                |
| 49:00      | Yeah, in my case, it just adds it, it's actually adding it to do now with a thing every five                                                   |
| 49:07      | minutes just to nag me to say, hey, get ready for this, just so that I'm really ready for                                                      |
| 49:15      | it because especially these wonderful standards that women are held up to, we are frequently                                                   |
| 49:24      | expected to do things like full faces of makeup and so on and sometimes I like doing it and                                                    |
| 49:28      | sometimes I don't want to do it but I always want to look professional, which means at                                                         |
| 49:32      | the very least, preferably not wearing my dressing gown and having a relatively tidy                                                           |
| 49:36      | background behind me, though sometimes it's not possible just depending on how things                                                          |
| 49:42      | are running, you know, if I've had a crazy day at work, then guess what, my background                                                         |
| 49:46      | is going to be messy if I've got an afternoon meeting just because I'll be pulling things                                                      |
| 49:50      | out and won't necessarily have had time to put everything back straight.                                                                       |
| 49:53      | Yeah, I have a Shoji screen, a Japanese screen that I keep against the wall and it takes                                                       |
| 50:00      | like two minutes to put that behind me, behind my chair if I'm going to do a call and because                                                  |
| 50:06      | now my computers in the centralised location of the house, I got kicked out of my studio                                                       |
| 50:14      | because of COVID, this is when my kids came home, I actually put that up almost for all                                                        |
| 50:18      | video calls because there may be somebody in my family walking behind if I'm not careful,                                                      |
| 50:24      | so yeah, but that's not really an automation tool, but it is pretty quick.                                                                     |
| 50:28      | I actually did have a screen like that, David, but my problem with it is it didn't fold flat,                                                  |
| 50:34      | so the way it was shown on Amazon, there were nice folds in it, so I thought, oh, great,                                                       |
| 50:40      | this is wonderful, I'm just going to be able to fold this flat and lean it against the                                                         |
| 50:43      | wall when I'm not using it and then pull it out when I am using it.                                                                            |
| 50:46      | That thing does not fold flat and it takes up about 80% of my office and if you straighten                                                     |
| 50:52      | it out, then it falls over, so it was just a nightmare, so I got rid of it and I bought                                                        |
| 50:58      | a green screen instead, which is great because I can pop that up behind me if I just need                                                      |
| 51:03      | to hide it.                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:04      | It doesn't quite cover everything my camera covers unless I adjust my camera settings,                                                         |
| 51:08      | which I need to tweak, but it does allow me to, at the very least, hide the messiest area.                                                     |
| 51:15      | Yeah, cool.                                                                                                                                    |

| 52:29      | Before I started using HelloFresh, I'd never really consistently cooked dinner for my family                                                   |
| 52:33      | and the meals that I did cook were boring and there were just a couple of them that                                                            |
| 52:37      | I could do competently.                                                                                                                        |
| 52:39      | Since I'm in for HelloFresh, I'm able to make some great meals and surprise the whole family                                                   |
| 52:43      | with different cuisines all the time.                                                                                                          |
| 52:46      | It's great time to put in a podcast and just make a great meal for your family and give                                                        |
| 52:51      | the rest of your family a break since you're taking care of it for them.                                                                       |
| 52:54      | Just recently, I made the HelloFresh Kraft Burger for the family and it was delicious.                                                         |
| 52:59      | They got the bun just right.                                                                                                                   |
| 53:02      | Using HelloFresh also saves me money.                                                                                                          |
| 53:04      | When I was going to the market to get ingredients for dinner, I would always buy too many and                                                  |
| 53:07      | we'd always end up with a bunch of extra stuff afterwards that we weren't going to use.                                                        |

| 53:15      | It's great.                                                                                                                                    |

| 53:39      | Our thanks to HelloFresh for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                                                                    |
| 53:45      | What about text messages?                                                                                                                      |
| 53:47      | I think this is another area ripe for some automation love.                                                                                    |
| 53:51      | Well, the good news is, David, I have been playing with text message automation or text                                                        |
| 53:57      | message and [[iMessage]] automation to be precise.                                                                                                 |
| 54:00      | So as people may be aware, I'm a big fan of [[PushCut]] and its automation server.                                                                 |
| 54:06      | And I was having a slight bout of insomnia in early December and kept finding things.                                                          |
| 54:11      | I'm wanting to share them with people, but not wanting to share them with people at three                                                      |
| 54:15      | o'clock in the morning, when if they didn't have do not disturb enabled, then, you know,                                                       |
| 54:19      | they would be annoyed by it.                                                                                                                   |
| 54:22      | And if they did have it, then they might just be worried that I was awake at three o'clock                                                     |
| 54:25      | in the morning.                                                                                                                                |
| 54:26      | And so instead, I have created two shortcuts, which allow me to schedule a message and then                                                    |
| 54:31      | send schedule message.                                                                                                                         |
| 54:33      | So for this, I'm using [[Pushcut\|PushCut's]] automation server and [[Data Jar]].                                                                               |
| 54:38      | And it works really well.                                                                                                                      |
| 54:40      | I'm really happy with it.                                                                                                                      |
| 54:41      | So to start with, I'll walk people through the schedule message and I'm going to put                                                           |
| 54:46      | both of these in the show notes.                                                                                                               |
| 54:49      | And so what it does is it starts by asking me for the text of whatever it is that I want                                                       |
| 54:53      | to, you know, share.                                                                                                                           |
| 54:55      | And then it asked me to choose a contact.                                                                                                      |
| 54:58      | Then it gets the phone numbers.                                                                                                                |
| 54:59      | If there's just one phone number, it grabs the first phone number.                                                                             |
| 55:03      | If there's more than one, it'll ask me to pick one.                                                                                            |
| 55:07      | Just, you know, in case I haven't got things set up particularly well and the first phone                                                      |
| 55:10      | number is actually their home phone or something.                                                                                              |
| 55:13      | And then it'll ask me for the date and time that I want to send this after.                                                                    |
| 55:17      | So it's not necessarily going to send this at a specific time.                                                                                 |
| 55:20      | Now I could do that, but I decided against it and I decided that I would be fine, you                                                          |
| 55:25      | know, having things sent after a specific time.                                                                                                |
| 55:29      | And then what it does is it will just create a dictionary and add that to the end of a                                                         |
| 55:38      | list in [[Data Jar]].                                                                                                                              |
| 55:40      | Now this list is called send later, and the dictionary has got a message, a to, a date                                                         |
| 55:44      | and a name.                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:45      | And the to is the phone number, and the name is then the name of the contact.                                                                  |
| 55:49      | So that later, when the delayed message is actually sent, then it will send me a notification                                                  |
| 55:56      | to tell me it's been sent.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:59      | And then, so the actual sending the delayed message starts by counting those items.                                                            |
| 56:05      | And if there's nothing there, then it just exits.                                                                                              |
| 56:09      | So it gets everything out of [[Data Jar]].                                                                                                         |
| 56:11      | And then if there are things in [[Data Jar]], then it will go through with each of them.                                                           |
| 56:15      | And it will get the date.                                                                                                                      |
| 56:16      | And if the date is before now, then it will send the message and send me a notification                                                        |
| 56:22      | to say that it sent the message.                                                                                                               |
| 56:24      | And then in the body, it's got the name and what the message actually was, just so I've                                                        |
| 56:27      | got a little reminder myself.                                                                                                                  |
| 56:29      | And then it deletes it.                                                                                                                        |
| 56:30      | And that's it.                                                                                                                                 |
| 56:31      | So it's relatively simple.                                                                                                                     |
| 56:36      | It sounds very complicated when I say this, but the shortcuts are 12 and 14 actions.                                                           |
| 56:42      | So they're not insurmountable to understand.                                                                                                   |
| 56:44      | But wow, does it make my life easier?                                                                                                          |
| 56:47      | You know, I was able to send my mom a message, she had an important meeting at work today,                                                     |
| 56:50      | but I was also going to be in a meeting at the same time.                                                                                      |
| 56:53      | So and I just wanted to send her a message 15 minutes before to say good luck.                                                                 |
| 56:57      | So I scheduled it and it sent it around about 15 minutes before.                                                                               |
| 57:01      | It's great.                                                                                                                                    |
| 57:02      | It works really well.                                                                                                                          |
| 57:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:04      | That's a good use case for it.                                                                                                                 |
| 57:05      | But sending a message at a specific time that you need it to go out.                                                                           |
| 57:09      | I have to admit though, like when you were talking earlier about synchronous versus asynchronous                                               |
| 57:13      | communications, I look at messages also as asynchronous communications.                                                                        |
| 57:18      | I don't expect when I message somebody for them to drop everything and respond back to                                                         |
| 57:24      | me.                                                                                                                                            |
| 57:25      | And if anybody expects me to do that, they're probably not going to be happy because I rarely                                                  |
| 57:29      | do that.                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:30      | I do let those keep that badge turned on and by the end of the day, I go through any unread                                                    |
| 57:35      | messages, but I don't just like drop everything anytime a message comes in.                                                                    |
| 57:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:40      | I mean, if it's urgent, then I would say like your best method is probably going to be calling                                                 |
| 57:44      | a person, but it also very much depends on who you're contacting.                                                                              |
| 57:47      | But I know if I send somebody a message, you know, before a meeting to say good luck or                                                        |
| 57:51      | something like that, if they haven't read it and don't respond is because they're busy                                                         |
| 57:54      | getting ready and you know, that's fine.                                                                                                       |
| 57:57      | And yeah, these are very much an asynchronous thing of I just want to send them the right                                                      |
| 58:00      | thing at the right time so that they know.                                                                                                     |
| 58:03      | And it also means that I can use this for birthday messages as well.                                                                           |
| 58:07      | Not because I don't care enough to actually manually send a birthday message.                                                                  |
| 58:10      | Of course I do.                                                                                                                                |
| 58:12      | But it means that the birthday message is definitely going to go out at the right time                                                         |
| 58:15      | instead of me going, oh shoot, it's 1130 and I still didn't say happy birthday and they've                                                     |
| 58:19      | just told me how great their cake looks.                                                                                                       |
| 58:21      | And now I look like an idiot who forgot their birthday.                                                                                        |
| 58:25      | So I think of this as another way of showing that I care about people.                                                                         |
| 58:29      | Okay.                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:30      | You've made the case to me.                                                                                                                    |
| 58:31      | I'm going to download your script and play with it because I was when I saw this, I was                                                        |
| 58:34      | thinking, I don't think I really want to schedule messages.                                                                                    |
| 58:36      | I'll either send it or I won't.                                                                                                                |
| 58:38      | I mean, the other thing is I don't, I don't have any problem with sending messages late                                                        |
| 58:42      | at night.                                                                                                                                      |
| 58:43      | Not that I'm really up that late very often, but if I do have something that occurs in                                                         |
| 58:46      | me, I'll send it.                                                                                                                              |
| 58:47      | Because I just assume the other person is, is like me and not going to respond until                                                           |
| 58:52      | the next day.                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:54      | You know, and if they do respond to me, I'll say, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?                                                           |
| 58:57      | You don't have to respond to me to him.                                                                                                        |
| 59:01      | But there's part of me now that's wondering, like, occasionally when it's my turn to publish                                                   |
| 59:07      | the show, I will get an email or a message from you, like in the afternoon saying, hey,                                                        |
| 59:14      | you got, you got the show.                                                                                                                     |
| 59:16      | You need any help or something.                                                                                                                |
| 59:17      | It's very friendly, the message, but now there's a secret part of me that thinks that's probably                                               |
| 59:21      | an automated message where you're looking to see if the show isn't published.                                                                  |
| 59:24      | It's going to send me a message to remind me without saying, hey, dummy, get the show                                                          |
| 59:29      | up.                                                                                                                                            |
| 59:30      | It's, it's not that smart, David.                                                                                                              |
| 59:32      | The way that that works is I have a due reminder to double check that the show has gone out                                                    |
| 59:36      | that goes off every hour from 6 PM my time.                                                                                                |
| 59:40      | And A, this is to make sure if I've set it up in advance, you know, if I've done it earlier                                                    |
| 59:45      | in the day or the day before that it actually goes out.                                                                                        |
| 59:48      | Because I have had that happen almost before where I realised at 11:30 PM that everything                                                     |
| 59:52      | was there.                                                                                                                                     |
| 59:53      | It just wasn't gone because it was still marked as a draft in the CMS and that was my fault.                                                   |
| 59:58      | But what you're saying is I'm getting an original Rosemary artisanally crafted message if I                                                    |
| 01:00:03   | don't post it.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:04   | You are.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:05   | Okay.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:06   | That's good to know.                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:07   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:08   | Because I always double check it.                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:09   | And if I see the, if I see the tweet come in, then of course I go off and market is red                                                        |
| 01:00:13   | or when it appears like, oh, yeah, I've already seen the tweet today.                                                                          |
| 01:00:16   | Mark it as read.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:17   | I'll tell you one of my challenges with messages and here's one where I'd welcome ideas from                                                   |
| 01:00:23   | the listeners is acting on messages like, you know, like when somebody sends me an email,                                                      |
| 01:00:29   | I've got all these cool automations where I can turn it into an [[OmniFocus]] task and, and                                                        |
| 01:00:34   | a calendar event and do cool things with it, but messages are not as easily transitioned                                                       |
| 01:00:41   | into action for me.                                                                                                                            |
| 01:00:42   | And in the case of a client will text me something that's actionable and I don't, I mean, I                                                    |
| 01:00:47   | like having emails with clients because then it's a record that they asked me to do this                                                       |
| 01:00:51   | or gave me this instruction and it's hard to really make it happen.                                                                            |
| 01:00:56   | I mean, I know that you can share a message and from there you can go into something like                                                      |
| 01:01:00   | [[OmniFocus]], but the whole process feels very manual to me and it happens rarely.                                                                |
| 01:01:08   | It's not like something that I do every day.                                                                                                   |
| 01:01:10   | So it's not a big enough problem that I've ever really tried to find a good automation                                                         |
| 01:01:14   | solution for it.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:01:15   | I mean, one of the things I do is often I'll take screenshots of a message.                                                                    |
| 01:01:20   | If it's something that's substantive that I may want to refer to later and I have a                                                            |
| 01:01:23   | pretty good system for storing those and, you know, using, you know, URL links to get                                                          |
| 01:01:29   | back to them and find an easy way to, you know, like tie the message to, to like a task.                                                       |
| 01:01:35   | But nothing, I feel like that whole system to me is pretty rickety.                                                                            |
| 01:01:40   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:01:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:01:42   | The only way I can think of of this is if your clients, if you have certain clients                                                            |
| 01:01:46   | who default to messages rather than email, then you could set up a [[Shortcuts]] automation.                                                       |
| 01:01:52   | It won't run automatically.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:53   | That is the downside, but then you can see the message and go, oh yeah, I want to run                                                          |
| 01:01:57   | the [[Shortcuts]] section on this and it will do this.                                                                                             |
| 01:02:00   | It will send them an email or capture it to [[OmniFocus]] or something like that.                                                                  |
| 01:02:06   | And you know, and so because, because of the 14.3 update with [[Shortcuts]], you can actually                                                      |
| 01:02:11   | get the details of the message out now, which is really helpful.                                                                               |
| 01:02:15   | So that means that you actually have the message body and the sender and the time and date                                                     |
| 01:02:18   | it was received and all of that jazz.                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:20   | So that makes it much easier, but it's still not perfect.                                                                                      |
| 01:02:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:24   | I need to look into that.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:02:25   | I had tried that earlier and wasn't getting the details I needed out via [[Shortcuts]] and                                                         |
| 01:02:30   | I forgot that with 4.3, I actually may be able to get more out of it.                                                                          |
| 01:02:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:34   | You can definitely get more.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:35   | You can get plenty of details of things out, which is really nice.                                                                             |
| 01:02:38   | Well, there's, there's my weekend automation list to see if I can get better stuff out                                                         |
| 01:02:43   | of messages.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:45   | Any other communication automation stuff on your plate?                                                                                        |
| 01:02:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:50   | So one of the things I need to look back into is setting DnD and [[Slack]].                                                                    |
| 01:02:56   | Do not disturb.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:57   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:58   | And for ages, I had a shortcut, which was created by [[Federico Viticci]] at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/)                         |
| 01:03:04   | that would mute [[Slack]] channels.                                                                                                                |
| 01:03:10   | And this is great and I love it, but I found that a lot of [[Slack]] channel admins don't let                                                      |
| 01:03:17   | me generate an [[API]] key, which means that I can mute, say, two out of the 10 different                                                          |
| 01:03:23   | [[Slack\|Slacks]] that I'm in.                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:26   | And so that is something I am not super happy about right now.                                                                                 |
| 01:03:30   | And so I've sent off some messages to people to say, hey, can I have this please?                                                              |
| 01:03:34   | Because I need to do it, you know, be able to do this with it.                                                                                 |
| 01:03:37   | And there are no downsides if you enable this.                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:40   | Okay, there might be.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:03:41   | But, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I need this and I need the ability to mute [[Slack]],                                                      |
| 01:03:47   | which is great.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:03:48   | And the other thing I've done, which is a tip I stole from [[Cortex]] is on my phone, I                                                            |
| 01:03:51   | have two different [[Slack]] applications.                                                                                                         |
| 01:03:53   | I have the [[Slack]] app and I have the [[Slack EMM]] app, which is their enterprise app.                                                              |
| 01:03:59   | And I have the enterprise app being the one that can actually send me notifications.                                                           |
| 01:04:03   | And then the other app can't send me notifications, but I can pop in there and look at the chats                                               |
| 01:04:07   | anytime I like.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:04:08   | And this is just for things which are, you know, firm related, where I don't necessarily                                                       |
| 01:04:12   | want to be, you know, pingable and things like that.                                                                                           |
| 01:04:15   | And it just means that when I open the [[Slack]] app, then I can see things like, you know,                                                        |
| 01:04:19   | our automators talk and the nested folders thing and [[Slack]] and [[The Sweet Setup]] [[Slack]] and                                                       |
| 01:04:26   | my mastermind group is in there.                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:28   | And you know, those are all important things I definitely want notifications about.                                                            |
| 01:04:33   | And that's a bit easier to manage than all of the [[Slack\|Slacks]] because I do have quite a few                                                         |
| 01:04:37   | for fun.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:04:39   | I think that that is a great tip because [[Slack]] can serve a lot of roles.                                                                       |
| 01:04:44   | I mean, they can serve a role where you are running a, you know, a podcast or a company                                                        |
| 01:04:50   | or something through it where those notifications really matter, but also like you, I belong                                                   |
| 01:04:55   | to [[Slack]] for some software teams that I'm a power user of their app and they just want                                                         |
| 01:05:00   | feedback from me, but I don't want them to be able to like interrupt me and, and running                                                       |
| 01:05:05   | it out of two apps is a great way to pull that off.                                                                                            |
| 01:05:07   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:05:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:05:09   | It makes it much easier to handle.                                                                                                             |
| 01:05:10   | I just wish I could do it on the Mac as well.                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:13   | And I know that I can, I can have a browser version and I mean, this is something else                                                         |
| 01:05:18   | that we, we have yet to cover David of course forums because forums are another way of communicating.                                          |
| 01:05:23   | And so I have bookmark groups for different things.                                                                                            |
| 01:05:27   | So I've got a bookmark group for forums and it's great to be able to just tap on that                                                          |
| 01:05:31   | and say, open all of these.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:32   | And then I can check in on the [Automators forum](https://talk.automators.fm).                                                                                               |
| 01:05:34   | I can see that Jeremy Chávez has been asking about extracting heart rate recovery data,                                                        |
| 01:05:38   | for example, and I can check in on the MPU forums, see a lot of people are going crazy                                                         |
| 01:05:42   | about your contextual computing episode, which came out recently, which was great Drafts,                                                      |
| 01:05:47   | things like that, you know, all of, all of the good things, but you can also get RSS                                                           |
| 01:05:51   | feeds out of these, but Slack is a lot more difficult to handle, unfortunately.                                                                |
| 01:05:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:05:56   | Agreed.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:05:57   | Okay.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:05:58   | You also have an entry in the outline.                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:59   | I don't know what this is, Rose.                                                                                                               |
| 01:06:00   | It's called [[Monica CRM]].                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:03   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:04   | So [[Monica CRM]] is, so [[CRM\|CRMs]] are basically a tool to allow sales teams to keep in touch                                                           |
| 01:06:11   | with customers, which Ian is for sales teams and we are not sales teams, we are real people,                                                   |
| 01:06:17   | but [[Monica CRM\|Monica]] is a self-hosted [[CRM]], which is basically trying to encourage you to keep                                                            |
| 01:06:21   | in touch with your friends and family and remember information about them.                                                                     |
| 01:06:25   | So it's kind of like a very souped up version of contacts and this is something I have been                                                    |
| 01:06:30   | playing with and one of the things I would really like to do this year is dive a lot                                                           |
| 01:06:34   | more into it because it allows you to log things like the last time that you got in                                                            |
| 01:06:38   | touch with somebody and, you know, things that you've talked about or important information                                                    |
| 01:06:41   | about them.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:42   | So I recently found out a friend of mine has announced her pregnancy and, you know, and                                                        |
| 01:06:46   | she, she, you know, is chatting with her and she's told me her approximate due date.                                                           |
| 01:06:50   | And so, you know, I've set up some things, so I've got a little reminder to get in touch                                                       |
| 01:06:54   | with her a week before and ask her how it's going and, you know, if there's anything that                                                      |
| 01:06:58   | I can send her, because obviously, you know, there's a pandemic, so I'm not going to be                                                        |
| 01:07:00   | going to visit and, you know, and that's something that I'm experimenting with using                                                           |
| 01:07:06   | [[Monica CRM\|Monica]] for.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:07   | Of course, there are lots of different ways that I can handle that.                                                                            |
| 01:07:09   | I could set something up in reminders or an [[OmniFocus]], but I like the fact that this is                                                        |
| 01:07:14   | very contact-centred.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:16   | So it's related to this and of course it's self-hosted, which means, you know, you do                                                          |
| 01:07:20   | have to do the heavy lifting to get it up and running yourself, but then you are in                                                            |
| 01:07:24   | charge of the data.                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:26   | So, you know, it works quite well.                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:29   | I'm liking it, but I've yet to see if it will remain a permanent addition to my life.                                                          |
| 01:07:35   | Yeah, I have done something kind of similar.                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:37   | I mean, over the last year, I spent a lot of time goofing off with this whole [[PKM\|personal knowledge management]]                                                        |
| 01:07:42   | space, you know, if you listen to [[Focus]] and [[Mac Power Users]], I've                                                         |
| 01:07:48   | talked about [[Roam Research]] and [[Obsidian]] and the latest one that's very interesting to                                                          |
| 01:07:53   | me is [[Craft]], which is a native app version of this stuff, but one of the things that's                                                         |
| 01:07:58   | common to all of these tools is that the idea of backlinks and page creation.                                                                  |
| 01:08:04   | So anytime, like, I have a link called Rosemary Orchard, well, that creates a page, whether                                                    |
| 01:08:10   | it's in a [[Roam Research]] page, an [[Obsidian]] [[Markdown]] document, or [[Craft]] page, but once                                                           |
| 01:08:16   | I create the link for Rosemary, I can then go to that page and see backlinks to everything                                                     |
| 01:08:22   | I've referenced her in.                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:23   | And like for you, Rose, you're all over my [[CRM]] or my [[PKM]] because we make podcasts together,                                                    |
| 01:08:29   | we're friends, we do all this stuff.                                                                                                           |
| 01:08:30   | So, I have all these different backlinks, but that also gives me a page that's just                                                            |
| 01:08:35   | empty that has those backlinks and a lot of people just leave it empty and have backlinks.                                                     |
| 01:08:39   | And I got thinking several months ago, well, what if I use those pages also as kind of                                                         |
| 01:08:44   | like a build your own [[CRM]].                                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:48   | So I created a template that, like I call it "Sparky CRM", but it's got a bunch of questions                                                     |
| 01:08:55   | like, and I don't use all of the fields that I have one for pronunciation.                                                                     |
| 01:09:00   | Like if it's somebody, I have a lot of friends that their names are not pronounced away,                                                       |
| 01:09:05   | you know, my Anglo-Saxon tongue grew up speaking.                                                                                              |
| 01:09:09   | So I like put in pronunciations.                                                                                                               |
| 01:09:11   | Like I'll put in special skills or interests they have or how we met.                                                                          |
| 01:09:18   | If I've done check-ins with them or just data, like if they have kids, what their kids' names                                                  |
| 01:09:22   | are.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:09:23   | So I don't like forget.                                                                                                                        |
| 01:09:24   | And so it's not really a [[CRM]] system.                                                                                                           |
| 01:09:26   | So much of it is just kind of like a personal note system.                                                                                     |
| 01:09:30   | And you could also do that in the [[Apple Contacts\|Contacts]] app on your Mac, just, you know, just or on                                                         |
| 01:09:35   | iOS, just there's a notes field, you can put stuff in there.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:38   | And for some reason, I find it in this context to be a better place to put stuff like that.                                                    |
| 01:09:44   | Because I don't reference it that often, but it's usually in relation to personal knowledge                                                    |
| 01:09:47   | management.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:09:48   | So it's a little bit off the reservation for today's show, but I've kind of built my                                                           |
| 01:09:53   | own as well.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:09:55   | And that's the thing.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:09:56   | You have to find all of your things that, you know, all of these things that work for                                                          |
| 01:09:59   | you because there's no point automating communication if it actually makes your life more difficult.                                           |
| 01:10:03   | We're trying to make your life easier here.                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:05   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:06   | But I think that everybody listening, we released the show on Friday for a reason, you know,                                                   |
| 01:10:11   | so you've got the weekend to maybe pull a couple of automations together and email and                                                         |
| 01:10:16   | communication automation is something that we could all get better at.                                                                         |
| 01:10:19   | So if you, you know, if you made it to this point, I hope that you're thinking about a                                                         |
| 01:10:23   | few things in your life you could automate with email.                                                                                         |
| 01:10:25   | We've given you a lot of options.                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:27   | We've got some downloads and the show notes and, and let us know how it's going.                                                               |
| 01:10:31   | And you can do that over at the automators forum, which is at [talk.automators.fm](https://talk.automators.fm).                                                              |
| 01:10:37   | So it's just a great group of people in their solely devoted automation.                                                                       |
| 01:10:42   | I learn stuff in there all the time.                                                                                                           |
| 01:10:43   | I love it when I Google a problem I have and I find the answer in the Automators forum                                                         |

| 01:10:49   | I love that.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                          |

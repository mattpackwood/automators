| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators, I'm David Sparks and I'm joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.             |
| 00:07      | Hello, Rose.                                                                                            |
| 00:08      | Hey, how are you doing today, David?                                                                    |
| 00:10      | I am excellent and we have a guest on the show that I have been looking forward to                      |
| 00:15      | having on.                                                                                              |
| 00:16      | Welcome to the show, Jeff Richardson.                                                                   |
| 00:18      | And I have looked forward to being on this show after listening to it since episode one,                |
| 00:21      | so thank you so much for having me.                                                                     |
| 00:23      | Thanks, Jeff.                                                                                           |
| 00:24      | So Jeff is a friend of mine. We have spoken together and done some various things. He's                 |
| 00:31      | a Mac nerd, but he happens to run a little-known website called iPhoneJD, which by little known         |
| 00:38      | means every lawyer with an iPhone is practically reading it, so that's awesome.                         |
| 00:44      | And Jeff is a tech geek and a nerd and a lawyer. And, you know, we had a rule on the                    |
| 00:49      | show, Jeff, that we can only have one lawyer on the show at a time.                                     |
| 00:52      | Good thing you hung up your hat a few weeks ago, huh?                                                   |
| 00:54      | Yeah, exactly. It made room for you to come in. But I want to just talk about Jeff for                  |
| 01:00      | a minute before we get into the show today because we hear a lot from listeners of the                  |
| 01:05      | show and I hear a lot from people saying, man, I love automakers, but it's just too                     |
| 01:09      | much. I get lost or whatever. And I know sometimes we go super nerdy, but that's really not the         |
| 01:15      | point of the show.                                                                                      |
| 01:16      | To me, the point is, does this sound like an opening statement, Jeff? I'm not sure.                     |
| 01:20      | Maybe it does.                                                                                          |
| 01:21      | I'll object if you go too far.                                                                          |
| 01:23      | The point in the statement, the show is that anybody can do this. Like, did you see that                |
| 01:30      | little Disney movie with the rat, you know, right there, do we?                                         |
| 01:33      | Absolutely.                                                                                             |
| 01:34      | Yeah, anybody can cook, anybody can automate. And Jeff is not a programmer by trade. He's               |
| 01:39      | a guy who's trying to make a living, you know, taking care of his clients, but he's doing               |
| 01:44      | a bunch of automation. And what I knew, Jeff, was kind of getting into this stuff. I said,              |
| 01:47      | we got to get you on.                                                                                   |
| 01:48      | So thanks for coming on, Jeff.                                                                          |
| 01:50      | Thanks, thanks. And I appreciate it because I at first never thought I would be worthy                  |
| 01:54      | of being a show like this because like you say, I'm not one of these total nerds. But                   |
| 01:58      | having said that, as I was thinking of automations that I use in daily life and the preparation         |
| 02:02      | for the show, I was almost surprised how many that I use because it's nice being more efficient.        |
| 02:07      | So hopefully some of the tips that I talk about today will be useful to others as well.                 |
| 02:11      | I do think that as good automations tend to fall off your memory, like you set them up                  |
| 02:19      | and they just start working and you don't think about them anymore. And that's actually                 |
| 02:22      | a good automation.                                                                                      |
| 02:23      | Yeah, agreed.                                                                                           |
| 02:25      | So Jeff, how'd you get started on all this?                                                             |
| 02:27      | Well, you know, a couple of weeks ago, y'all had Dave Hamilton on the show. And when you                |
| 02:31      | asked him that same question, he talked about his first computer being a Timex Sinclair,                |
| 02:36      | which made me laugh because my first computer was the precursor to that, the Sinclair ZX81,             |
| 02:42      | which unlike the Timex Sinclair, which had 2K of memory, my first computer had only                     |
| 02:47      | 1K of memory, efficiency was definitely required. Now I had an expansion port and some other            |
| 02:52      | things for it, an external keyboard and everything else. But when I think back to that Sinclair         |
| 02:56      | ZX81, right there on the keyboard, one of the unique things about it is that it had                     |
| 03:01      | printed commands on the keys so that when you were typing basic and if you had to put                   |
| 03:07      | print or something, in addition, you didn't actually have to type PRINT. You could actually             |
| 03:12      | just put your finger on the P key, which on the built-in keyboard was a membrane, and                   |
| 03:17      | it would write the word PRINT. And you knew that was going to happen because when you                   |
| 03:19      | looked at your keyboard, PRINTED above the P key is the word PRINT, and PRINTED above                   |
| 03:24      | the G key is the word GO TO. So I mean, literally since day one of me using my own computer,            |
| 03:29      | I was, you know, pressing one letter to have an entire word appear, which is really sort                |
| 03:34      | of, you know, the basics of automation, right? And so I have been using automation in one               |
| 03:38      | form or another since then. After my Sinclair computer, I had a Commodore 64, and then I                |
| 03:44      | finally moved on to my first Mac in 1988, a Mac Plus. And it wasn't long after I started                |
| 03:51      | using the Mac Plus that I remember using a program called Type It For Me, which was written             |
| 03:56      | by Ricardo Aitor, if I'm pronouncing that correctly. And that software, which I used                    |
| 04:02      | in the 80s, is actually still around today, which is amazing. I use a competitor today                  |
| 04:06      | called TextExpander, but it's amazing that I've been doing some form of automation for                  |
| 04:12      | that long.                                                                                              |
| 04:13      | Yeah, it's really hard. Anytime someone talks about old computers for me to not like follow             |
| 04:18      | you down that rabbit hole.                                                                              |
| 04:20      | But yes.                                                                                                |
| 04:21      | We could talk about that for two hours. That's a different time to ask for that.                        |
| 04:23      | Sinclair was, that was probably the first object of lust in my life. I wanted that.                     |
| 04:28      | Because I remember it was like, they sold it at like department stores, and it was like                 |
| 04:33      | $100 or something. And it had a thermal printer. I remember it had like a little thermal printer        |
| 04:39      | thing you could plug into it. Man, I wanted that printer.                                               |
| 04:41      | I wanted it so bad, but my parents are like, we're not spending that much money on this.                |
| 04:47      | But yeah, I get it. Okay, so I'm going to leave that there. But yeah, I do think that                   |
| 04:52      | it's interesting that so many people start automation with text because that is obviously               |
| 04:59      | something we do a lot on computers and a very natural place to start automating.                        |
| 05:06      | What are you doing with TextExpander these days? I mean, you've been on this journey                   |
| 05:10      | with text automation for a long time.                                                                   |
| 05:12      | Yeah. In fact, a lot of the text automation that I'm doing is, I mean, let me start by                  |
| 05:17      | saying that I use all sorts of different platforms. I use, I've been a Mac user at home since           |
| 05:22      | the 1980s. I have been a PC user since my law firm switched over from the Mac to the                    |
| 05:27      | PC in the early 2000s because at the time, there wasn't a lot of legal software for the                 |
| 05:32      | Mac, which has fortunately gotten better. But so I use PC at work, Mac at home, but                     |
| 05:37      | my real love are my iPhone and iPad, my iOS devices. And so, I mean, that's where I get                 |
| 05:43      | so much work done, sometimes exclusively or sometimes as a compliment to the PC or Mac.                 |
| 05:49      | And so a lot of the automation text expansion and stuff that I'm doing is on the iPhone.                |
| 05:55      | And although I do want to talk about TextExpander, you know, the most basic thing that                 |
| 05:59      | I use and like the number one tip I give so many people is to use the built in iOS text                 |
| 06:05      | expansion, which anyone can get to, you don't have to buy anything extra. You just go to                |
| 06:09      | the settings app and you go to general and then keyboards and then text replacement.                    |
| 06:14      | And you can say, every time I type this, I want you to put that. And I suspect most folks               |
| 06:19      | listening to this podcast know about this, but let me, let me share some examples of                    |
| 06:23      | things that I do because maybe one of these will sort of, you know, make you think of                   |
| 06:26      | something in your own life. You know, some of what I do is just straight up text expansion.             |
| 06:31      | For example, I often have to, as a lawyer, I have to record my time so that I can bill                  |
| 06:36      | my client at the end of the month. And so I might often use a phrase like telephone                     |
| 06:41      | conference with Mr. Sparks to discuss such and such. But I don't want to take that phrase               |
| 06:46      | over and over again. So I have a program that anytime that I put TCW, which are not three               |
| 06:51      | letters I would normally type together, it changes it to telephone conference with or                   |
| 06:55      | RCF is review correspondence from. So that's the basic form of it. And I feel like that's               |
| 07:00      | sort of what it was designed for in the first place. But I also use it for things that I                |
| 07:03      | just don't feel like, you know, maybe sort of a one step aside from that is something                   |
| 07:07      | like typing email addresses because you don't want to have to type your email address, not              |
| 07:11      | only because it's longer, but you also don't want to make a mistake. I mean, last thing                 |
| 07:15      | you want to do is put a straight character in the middle of your email address and then                 |
| 07:19      | someone, you know, has it wrong. So I have a little shortcut that if I ever type JJ,                    |
| 07:23      | because my name is Jeff, so J and another J. And then with a third letter, it will type                 |
| 07:28      | the email address. So my law firm, Adams and Reese is arlaw.com. So if I type JJ, it does                 |
| 07:35      | Jeff Richardson at arlaw.com. If I do JJ, I it's Jeff at iPhone JD.com, et cetera, et                   |
| 07:41      | cetera. So that's really useful.                                                                        |
| 07:43      | Rose, how do you automate and what is your, everybody's got like a snippet code for their               |
| 07:49      | email? Which one do you use?                                                                            |
| 07:51      | So I do whatever the handle is followed by at. So for example, if I am using my regular                 |
| 07:57      | email address is contact at and then it fills in rosemaryorchard.com. I also do like other                |
| 08:02      | ones like I've got feeds for all of the RSS feed type things that I would use and work                  |
| 08:08      | as well, which I've just called generic work at because that actually replaces it with                  |
| 08:13      | my work email address rather than one of my email addresses. But I always use the handle                |
| 08:17      | followed by at just because my brain quite likes that. It seems, what about you?                        |
| 08:23      | For me, it's always, I just do E followed by it. Like E David is personal. E law is law.                |
| 08:29      | E spark is sparky, you know, and I just, just put E with whatever. But you know, everybody              |
| 08:35      | has a different way to do it. But man, if you're not automating your email address,                     |
| 08:40      | you should.                                                                                             |
| 08:41      | Yeah, a lot of the times iOS in particular does a really good job of suggesting it, but                 |
| 08:47      | it doesn't always manage to do it. And I found sometimes for whatever reason, it just starts            |
| 08:52      | suggesting completely the wrong email address. Like for a week, a while ago, it was suggesting          |
| 08:56      | my work email address for everything is like, I don't ever sign up to anything with my work             |
| 09:00      | email address. In the end, I fixed it by just removing my work email address from my contact.           |
| 09:05      | But I don't know why it suddenly decided to prioritise that one over the other ones                     |
| 09:09      | that I've been using for whoever knows how long.                                                        |
| 09:12      | Or you know, another one is if you have like clients or people you work with that have an               |
| 09:17      | unusual name that's hard to type. Like I had a Russian client who had a very, his name                  |
| 09:23      | was just, it had a bunch of accent characters in it. And every time I typed it, it was like             |
| 09:27      | a project, right? So I just made a shortcut for his name. And like that kind of stuff,                  |
| 09:33      | it sounds basic, but I think a lot of people don't think to do it. And instead, they make               |
| 09:38      | themselves try to figure out how to type that name every time and where the accent characters           |
| 09:42      | are where a very simple automation can, can simplify that and make sure you never spell                 |
| 09:48      | the client's name wrong, which is also a pretty good idea.                                              |
| 09:51      | Well, the other thing is, is how often do you spell your own name wrong? Maybe it's                     |
| 09:54      | easier if your name is Jeff or David, but I know with Rosemary, I've got eight characters                |
| 09:58      | and you know, there's a good chance that a couple of them are going to get typed in                     |
| 10:01      | the wrong order every once in a while. So every time I make a misspelling of my name,                   |
| 10:05      | I add it to the dictionary and fix it by putting in the right one. And it means that it should          |
| 10:10      | be always auto capitalised as well, which can be quite nice when your name also happens                 |
| 10:15      | to be a herb.                                                                                           |
| 10:16      | Well, Ros, that was actually the next tip I was going to give because for text expansion,               |
| 10:21      | you know, for using this part of the iPhone, it's not just for text expansion. It's not                 |
| 10:24      | just for typing something short and making it long, but it's also the way to add words                  |
| 10:28      | to the dictionary. Because the last thing you want is for you to type something correctly               |
| 10:32      | and your iPhone to automatically change it to something that's wrong, or even just to                   |
| 10:36      | tell you that it's not the right word. And you know, an example of that in my law practice,             |
| 10:41      | I do mostly appellate law, which means I file something called a RIT, W-R-I-T. And that's               |
| 10:46      | not a word that my iPhone knows. Maybe it thinks I forgot to put the E and I was trying                 |
| 10:51      | to put right or something. And so if you go into the same place on your iPhone that I                   |
| 10:55      | just described or your iPad and you say, every time I type the word RIT, W-R-I-T, I want                |
| 11:01      | you to replace it with the exact same word, W-R-I-T. What you're really doing is you're                 |
| 11:06      | adding it to the built-in dictionary, and therefore it won't show up trying to change                   |
| 11:10      | it to something else. Another example is I'm looking at my window and there's a local                   |
| 11:15      | theatre here that has like, you know, Broadway type productions called the Sanger, S-A-E-N-G-E-R,       |
| 11:21      | which is a strange word. And my iPhone would never, would always think it's wrong and try               |
| 11:25      | to correct it to something else, singer or something like that. But by using this tip,                  |
| 11:29      | I could make sure that the iPhone knows, no, no, no, if I type that, that's what I mean.                |
| 11:33      | Yeah, I think you can nowadays get away with just putting it in the replacement field,                  |
| 11:38      | because the phrase, the part that triggers it is optional. But I know for a while that                  |
| 11:43      | that wasn't always 100% reliable. So I've got a lot of things where it's exactly the                    |
| 11:46      | same thing in the phrase as it is in the replacement. But it is really good to add things to your       |
| 11:53      | dictionary just because I'm sure there are things that all of us use every once in a                    |
| 11:57      | while. It's like, oh, yeah, iPhone randomly corrects this to other word that is definitely              |
| 12:01      | not what I wanted. Thanks iOS or macOS occasionally, because these sync between your iPhone and         |
| 12:06      | your Mac as well, which is quite useful for everybody who's on both the platforms.                      |
| 12:11      | I think a good trigger for that for me is anytime I type it the way I want it and iPhone                |
| 12:18      | fixes it, you know, I'm holding up air quotes, and you catch yourself where you have to press           |
| 12:23      | the but the miss the misspelling that the iPhone perceives, you know, to in order to                    |
| 12:29      | make it stick. That's you're like, Oh, wait a second, I need if I'm ever going to type                  |
| 12:32      | this word again, I'm going to fix this via automation.                                                  |
| 12:37      | That reminds me there was a post if folks read John gripper's website during fireball,                  |
| 12:42      | he described something in December of last year, where people who were tight and I was                  |
| 12:46      | a victim of this to people who would type 20 to zero on the keyboard, it suddenly wanted                |
| 12:51      | to be changed to 2.0, which was never ever appropriate for me.                                          |
| 12:55      | And he has a long post explaining why that is, it was the name of some app was like,                    |
| 12:59      | you know, app name 2.0, and it was changing it. But he, you know, his solution was exactly              |
| 13:03      | what I described just go in and say, you know, when I when I say to zero, I mean to zero.               |
| 13:09      | So that was another another example of that, you know, another related one that I had for               |
| 13:12      | years, which I cannot ever explain is my wife's name is Tina, pretty simple name T. I. N. A.            |
| 13:19      | But for some reason, and maybe it's not the iPhone's fault, I think it might be my fingers              |
| 13:23      | fault. But when I type it on my keyboard, it would think that I was typing "tona" T. O.                   |
| 13:27      | N. A. Instead of T. I. N. A. Which makes no sense to me because I don't think "tona" is                   |
| 13:31      | a word. Maybe it is over there in England. Rose, I don't know, but I don't think you're                 |
| 13:35      | in America. No. So why would you ever think that's what I was trying to type. But but                   |
| 13:39      | again, I fixed it by telling the iPhone if you ever see something, then you think I'm                   |
| 13:42      | typing "tona", just go ahead and change that to "Tina" and that fix that one.                               |
| 13:47      | The last tip that I give for text replacement is for characters that cannot otherwise be                |
| 13:52      | typed, you know, punctuation symbols that either can't be typed using the iPhone's keyboard.            |
| 13:58      | An example of one is one that we as lawyers use. People often call it the paragraph sign                |
| 14:02      | or if you want to be fancy schmancy, you could call it the pilcrow sign. But that's the character       |
| 14:06      | that the iPhone can display perfectly fine. There's just no way to type it. But if you                  |
| 14:12      | add it into your dictionary and say whenever I type, you know, this little, you know, two               |
| 14:15      | or three keys, replace it with this, that way you can use the paragraph symbol or, you                  |
| 14:20      | know, other things like that. So anyway, you know, the bottom line for me is that there                 |
| 14:25      | is just a wealth of things that you can do with text replacement on the iPhone that will                |
| 14:29      | make your life, you know, making more efficient, but it was also just make you want to pull             |
| 14:32      | your hair less often, which I think is always good. So so I like starting there.                        |
| 14:37      | Definitely. I agree with that. And also sometimes you can even do things in specific applications.      |
| 14:42      | Like for example, I know the the IDE, the program that I used to write applications                     |
| 14:47      | at work every day, that actually has the option to have certain text expansions in it. Microsoft        |
| 14:52      | Word usually has a dictionary as well. So if there are things that you only need to be                  |
| 14:56      | able to have in certain environments, then you can use those in them as well. Like I                    |
| 15:00      | know pages on the Mac has a dictionary as well as having the built in text replacement                  |
| 15:06      | in Mac OS as well. So it's worth having a look at those if if you need something like                   |
| 15:09      | that too.                                                                                               |
| 15:10      | Let me let me interrupt there for a second, though, because there's one thing that I think              |
| 15:13      | a lot of people don't realise when you're using the native text replacement and you're                  |
| 15:19      | building it on the on the iPhone or iPad, you cannot create multi line text replacements,               |
| 15:26      | at least not in my experience, unless they fixed it and I haven't caught that. But on                   |
| 15:31      | the Mac, you can. And it's kind of a secret feature. You hit option return at the end                   |
| 15:36      | of a line. And it creates like if you want to say best regards comma new line Jeff, right?              |
| 15:44      | The native text replacement looks like you can't do that because it's just one line and                 |
| 15:47      | carriage return is not allowed. But if you hit option return, it actually adds a return                 |
| 15:54      | and you can have to a two line text entry. And then when you go over on the iPhone and                  |
| 15:58      | iPad, it'll work. And I just think a lot of people aren't aware of that. So I was not                   |
| 16:03      | aware of that. That's interesting for me. Anything that's more complicated, they like                   |
| 16:06      | like that. That's when I use TextExpander. I didn't even realise that that was possible.               |
| 16:10      | Yeah, sometimes every software nail bug out and lose lines or it'll insert it when you've               |
| 16:16      | typed it and it will just smush it all onto one line. And I'm not quite sure what's going               |
| 16:21      | on there. I have a feeling that iOS text expansion was never built to support multi line text           |
| 16:27      | strings, which is a shame. So that's where something is getting lost. But it's still                    |
| 16:33      | there on the Mac and it definitely works on the Mac too. So for two or three very occasionally          |
| 16:38      | line things, I still use the built in text expansion.                                                   |
| 16:41      | Yeah, I guess it comes with like a warning label, you know, it's like, don't get too                    |
| 16:47      | fancy because that I think it will not work if you like, I've never tried it with like                  |
| 16:51      | multiple carriage returns, but I suspect you may have a problem. So where is that line                  |
| 16:57      | for you, Jeff? When do you go from, you said, you know, you go to TextExpander, something              |
| 17:02      | gets a little more complicated. What type of automations are you doing in TextExpander?                |
| 17:07      | Well, first of all, some of the same automations I put in TextExpander like the email ones.            |
| 17:12      | So I have it sort of double in both places. And of course, on the iPhone, if I switch                   |
| 17:16      | from the regular keyboard to the TextExpander keyboard, I can actually literally use them              |
| 17:20      | there. But most for me, I usually use TextExpander when I'm thinking about my computer,                |
| 17:25      | whether it's a PC or the Mac, because it works on both platforms. And so, you know, some                |
| 17:29      | of the things that I just described for iOS, I have repeated there. But then I have things              |
| 17:33      | that go beyond it, you know, I have like things that are specific to my law practice. And               |
| 17:37      | you know, this is going to be different for everyone, whether you're a doctor or a plumber              |
| 17:41      | or whatever your line of business is, you know, there's probably words or phrases that                  |
| 17:45      | you type frequently. And, you know, TextExpander can just save you so much time and be so much         |
| 17:50      | more efficient and make you so much more precise. And a perfect example is as a lawyer, as              |
| 17:54      | a litigator, I'm often, you know, telling a court, you know, you should do this because                 |
| 17:59      | this is what was done in another case by the Supreme Court of my state. And the way that                |
| 18:03      | you cite to that is you cite to the what in the old days was an actual book that it would               |
| 18:08      | be in. And so here in the southern part of Louisiana, it's a book called the Southern                   |
| 18:12      | Second or Southern Third. But I mentioned all that because there's a precise way to                     |
| 18:16      | cite those volumes. It's an S and an O and a period. And then I like to put a non breaking              |
| 18:21      | space so it doesn't, you know, split the phrase. And then either number two in the letter D,            |
| 18:27      | it's got like this little thing that to make it look correctly. And I don't want to have                |
| 18:30      | to worry about typing that correctly every time. So I have a very simple shortcut that                  |
| 18:34      | if I just type SS2, it automatically expands to the Southern Second Book, SS3, the Southern             |
| 18:42      | Third, things like that. And so it's an example of what I was talking about before. It saves            |
| 18:46      | me time, a lot of time. But it also is more precise. It means that I'm always doing it                  |
| 18:51      | correctly every time. I'm always make sure that the S is capitalised and the O is not                   |
| 18:56      | capitalised. So I don't make a mistake just because my fingers were hidden holding down                 |
| 19:00      | the shift key too long. So I use it for that. And you know, long client names that I don't              |
| 19:04      | want to have to type correctly every time I use that a lot. And I love that TextExpander               |
| 19:08      | is cross platform. So once I do it on my PC or Mac, it works in the other place too.                    |
| 19:13      | And that works great. But the more complicated one that I've been doing all the time, and               |
| 19:17      | I could go on forever TextExpander, but I'll just mention one more. And it's so simple,                |
| 19:22      | but I use it all the time. And here's the problem that I'm facing. And there's many                     |
| 19:25      | solutions to it. But this is my solution. Oftentimes, I copy text from somewhere, something             |
| 19:31      | online, something from another brief, something from doesn't matter where it is. And I just             |
| 19:35      | want to paste it someplace else without the formatting. And most of my life as a lawyer                 |
| 19:40      | is in Microsoft Word. And there was a built in command in Microsoft Word to paste without               |
| 19:43      | formatting. And you could assign a Microsoft Word shortcut to it, but then that only works              |
| 19:47      | in Microsoft Word. I like having something that works everywhere. And so I have the most                |
| 19:52      | simple to formula in the world in TextExpander, or I simply tell it that the content type              |
| 19:59      | is plain text, which is going to take out the formatting. And then I just, you know,                    |
| 20:03      | use a little, you know, click an icon for a little macro and put keyboard up a clipboard                |
| 20:07      | rather, and then give it an abbreviation. And the one that I've used, which makes no                    |
| 20:11      | sense except to my brain is the two X's next to each other and the letter C for clipboard.              |
| 20:17      | So every single time I type XXC, which I can do with my left hand alone, it will take whatever          |
| 20:22      | is on my clipboard and paste it without the formatting. And that may sound simple, but                  |
| 20:28      | it is useful to me all the time. It is useful when I'm writing emails, and I don't want                 |
| 20:32      | to by mistake change the formatting of the email that I'm in an outlook when I'm writing                |
| 20:36      | a brief. And I want to take the format of the brief I'm using, not the place that I                     |
| 20:40      | took it from when I am writing a blog post for my website. And I just want plain text,                  |
| 20:45      | and I don't want what I was copying something from. I mean, I use it all the time. And if               |
| 20:49      | there's just so simple, it's the simplest automation in the world, but it makes me more                 |
| 20:54      | efficient and it makes me happy. I use it. I mean, I can't even imagine the number of                   |
| 20:58      | times I use it a day when you used the TextExpander app that give you a little report                  |
| 21:02      | of how much time the app saved you each month. And one of these days, I think they're going             |
| 21:07      | to tell me, oh, by the way, just this one saved you two hours right there. And everything               |
| 21:11      | else was just another hour or something. I love that shortcut.                                          |
| 21:13      | Yeah. Yeah. But you know, I like the intentionality brought to the snippet to say, it's a keyboard      |
| 21:20      | shortcut I can trigger with one hand. And I think that like, if it's something you're                   |
| 21:24      | going to be using often, you should think about that because that can really help kind                  |
| 21:29      | of speed things up. Another thing about that, and I know this is mainly on Mac, but it doesn't          |
| 21:35      | require you to hit an alternative keyboard on the iOS devices. It's just a very smart                   |
| 21:41      | way to do that. And, and honestly, I think everybody who uses TextExpander needs to                    |
| 21:47      | have the pace playing the pace point text. I mean, the OS does have some support for                    |
| 21:52      | it. Sometimes, you know, you hit various combinations of keys followed by the letter                    |
| 21:57      | V, and you get a plain text import. But there's nothing like having an app like, like               |
| 22:01      | TextExpander, just make sure it's rock solid and works everywhere.                                          |
| 22:05      | Yeah. And I also mentioned on the iPhone and iPad, I used to have using the shortcuts app,              |
| 22:10      | I had something that did the same thing. And it wasn't, it didn't work all the time for                 |
| 22:14      | some, I don't know, sometimes I don't understand why shortcuts isn't doing what it should do.           |
| 22:17      | But I know always that if I'm typing on the iPhone or iPad, and I switch my keyboard to                 |
| 22:23      | the TextExpander keyboard, every single time I type XXC, it's going to work. And it's                  |
| 22:28      | just nice to know that something's going to work.                                                       |
| 22:30      | Yeah. Yeah. It really is. And that is the magic of, you know, setting these things up                   |
| 22:35      | yourself. You know, once you, once you've done that, then you know it's going to work                   |
| 22:39      | in all the apps. It doesn't matter whether or not the, the application supports the standard            |
| 22:43      | command for pace without formatting, which is command to fee, because it you, you're                    |
| 22:49      | just, you're just typing the thing that you know will give you plain text.                              |
| 22:54      | This episode of the automators podcast is brought to you by Fitbod. Go to Fitbod.me slash               |
| 23:00      | automators to get stronger faster with a fitness plan that fits you and you get 25% off your            |
| 23:06      | membership. It's very normal for people to start considering their health and fitness                   |
| 23:10      | around this time of year, but between balancing work, family and everything else you've got             |
| 23:15      | going on, it can sometimes be hard to make fitness a priority. What you need is a program               |
| 23:20      | that works with you, not against you. And that's why you need Fitbod. Fitbod's algorithm                |
| 23:25      | learns about you, your goals and your training ability. And we'll craft a personalised exercise         |
| 23:30      | plan that's unique to you. And their app makes it incredibly easy to learn exactly how to               |
| 23:35      | perform each exercise. Personal fitness isn't about competing with other people. You don't              |
| 23:41      | want to look to others and try to stack up against them and do what they do. What you                   |
| 23:45      | need is something that will work for you. That's when it'll really stick and when you'll see            |
| 23:50      | the results you're looking for. Fitbod uses data to create and adjust your dynamic fitness plan.        |
| 23:56      | And you'll have instant access to your own personalised routine and they're fantastic                   |
| 24:01      | apps. So you can make progress on your own goals from anywhere. Before COVID, I had a gym               |
| 24:06      | membership and to tell you the truth, I wasn't super happy with it. I didn't like the music             |
| 24:11      | they played super loud. I didn't like people yelling at me all the time. It's just not my thing.        |
| 24:15      | And when I started staying home, I got a subscription to Fitbod. I gave it a list                       |
| 24:20      | of my existing equipment and it started giving me exercise. And I've got goals right now and            |
| 24:25      | I'm working through them and Fitbod is helping me. What I love about the app is it doesn't              |
| 24:30      | scream at you and doesn't play loud music. It just gives you exercise with your equipment.              |
| 24:35      | And if you decide to add something new to your gym equipment, it will create exercises around           |
| 24:40      | that for you as well. I'm just really happy with it. The power play here is to set up a Fitbod          |
| 24:46      | routine and then watch something that you like on TV. Like I often watch YouTube videos about           |
| 24:51      | people like Aristotle while I'm sitting here doing crunches and it actually works for me.               |
| 24:56      | I am much happier with Fitbod than I was with the gym and I'm not going back.                           |
| 25:00      | Everyone's fitness path is different, which is why Fitbod does so much work to make sure                |
| 25:04      | they customise things exactly to suit you. Then make sure to learn from your last workout so            |
| 25:09      | your next will be even better, whether you work out twice a day or twice a week. Fitbod even            |
| 25:14      | tracks your muscle recovery to make sure your plan is balanced with a variety of exercises              |
| 25:20      | to make sure you're not overworking anything. The Fitbod app is so simple to use and recently           |
| 25:25      | got updated with a fantastic new design with brand new HD video tutorials shot from multiple            |
| 25:30      | angles to make sure that learning each exercise is a breeze. And it also integrates with your Apple     |
| 25:35      | watch, Wear OS, smartwatch and apps like Strava, Fitbit and Apple Health. Personalised training         |
| 25:42      | of this quality can be expensive, but Fitbod is just $12.99 a month or $79.99 a year. But you can       |

| 26:08      | for their support of the automators and all of Relay FM. So Jeff, you were telling us before            |
| 26:15      | we start recording that you have a really tiny automation that you really wanted to mention             |
| 26:20      | about email filtering or filing. Can you can you share that with us? Sure. And there's nothing          |
| 26:25      | complicated about it, but it is so useful to me. I am, you know, I use email all the time. It's         |
| 26:31      | that's how I communicate with clients and everything else. I laugh when I talk to my                    |
| 26:35      | teenagers because they barely touch email for them. They barely even touch texting. You know,           |
| 26:39      | if you want to communicate, you use, I don't know, [[Discord]] or whatever the new thing that               |
| 26:42      | takes. But for me, I live in email and sometimes I'm accessing it on my PC here at work. And one        |
| 26:49      | of the things as a lawyer that I need to do is take an email that's associated with one of the          |
| 26:54      | cases I'm working on and file it into my document management system that's associated with that         |
| 26:59      | case. And that's pretty easy to do on my PC, because my PC is the document management system we         |
| 27:07      | use called [[iManage]] is integrated into Outlook. So there's a number of ways to do it. But then if        |
| 27:12      | I'm using my iPhone or my iPad or my Mac, I lose those tools. And so one of the things that I have      |
| 27:19      | set up and you know, if anyone out there is using a document management system, a DMS, I'm sure they    |
| 27:24      | have something similar they can do. But I have created in my inbox, a folder that's called Move         |
| 27:30      | To. And within that folder, I have created all of these folders that are essentially shortcuts.         |
| 27:36      | The way that I can do it is within the Move To folder, I'll have something that's called, for           |
| 27:41      | example, MT, just short for Move To, MT-Smith versus Jones. And then I tell my PC that anytime          |
| 27:50      | something is placed into that folder, what I want you to do is move it over to the appropriate          |
| 27:55      | folder of my document management system associated with that case. My PC is on all the time at my       |
| 28:03      | office. I really never travel with it. I just keep it there and plugged in all the time. So I know      |
| 28:07      | that no matter where I am, no matter what time of day it is around the world, anytime that I move       |
| 28:12      | something into that folder, which I can do very easily on my iPhone or my iPad, it gets filed           |
| 28:16      | away in the appropriate place. And that is so critical for me because I get so much email every         |
| 28:21      | day that if I don't file something where it goes, I know in theory, I should just be able to search     |
| 28:26      | and find anything, but that's really not helpful. What I really want to say is if I'm working on        |
| 28:31      | the Smith versus Jones lawsuit, I want to see every email associated with that lawsuit,                 |
| 28:37      | but not the 500 other cases I have, just that one. And so filing things appropriately                   |
| 28:42      | is critical. And it's also part of a triage for me because lots of times I get emails in                |
| 28:47      | and I just need to look at the email and that's all I need. And then I just put it away and I'm         |
| 28:51      | done with it. And being able to, on my iPhone, just very quickly select, use the little move            |
| 28:57      | function on my iPhone and put it into that folder or really that shortcut. It's the one that begins     |
| 29:03      | with an MT and then has the case name. And then my computer does all the hard work on the back end.     |
| 29:07      | Boy, that saves me a lot of work. So anyone out there that has a similar situation,                     |
| 29:11      | whenever I show something like that to the other attorneys in my law firm,                              |
| 29:14      | they're always like, wow, show me that too. It's a great time saver.                                    |
| 29:18      | Yeah, that is really smart because it, again, is setting it up in one place so that it works            |
| 29:24      | in all the other places. And that is genius. I have some folders. I don't do this with email,           |
| 29:32      | but I have some [[Dropbox]] folders called, or [[Dropbox]] folder called automated action,                      |
| 29:35      | which has subfolders, which means that when stuff lands in those subfolders,                            |
| 29:39      | my always on Mac mini at home just goes, yep, I'm on it and deals with whatever it is for me.           |
| 29:44      | It's the same kind of principle. It gives me the same access everywhere with the magic.                 |
| 29:49      | Sure. And I've heard you and David talk about like a program called [[Hazel]] that you use in the Mac       |
| 29:53      | that you put something in a folder and it sends it somewhere else. And I don't use my Mac in            |
| 29:57      | that way enough to use it, but it's the same idea. It's so nice. You put it here and then it does       |
| 30:01      | the rest. Yeah, exactly. And that's really smart. I should look at doing that for email because I       |
| 30:05      | have some things where I need rules to automatically run. And I'm pretty certain I can make something   |
| 30:11      | happen with the always on Mac mini and the mail app. So I'm going to be stealing the leaf out of        |
| 30:15      | your book there. It's really fun though, just the idea of it knowing that you triggered something       |
| 30:21      | and now a computer somewhere else in the world is working for you. I find that very empowering.         |
| 30:26      | I don't know why. Maybe it's just because I'm a nerd. It is pretty awesome. The other thing that        |
| 30:32      | I know that you use, Jeff, which is a pet love of mine is [[Keyboard Maestro]] because keyboard             |
| 30:38      | maestro, of course, is magical. I think if you wanted to do it, then you could probably get it          |
| 30:43      | to orchestrate an entire musical, but I'm sure you're using it in a lot of novel ways. Can you          |
| 30:49      | share some of those with us? Okay, well, let me begin by saying that it may be magical, but it's        |
| 30:53      | also darn confusing for those of us who are not the automated or gods like you and David, because       |
| 30:58      | the only reason I started to use [[Keyboard Maestro]] is because you two talked about it for so long on     |
| 31:03      | this podcast. It's working. And then David came out with his field guidebooks for Here's How You        |
| 31:08      | Do It. And I'm like, you're basically putting it on a plate and teaching me, I was like, okay,          |
| 31:12      | I just got to go ahead and do it. So that's now been a year or two now that I've been using it.         |
| 31:18      | I will admit that when I open up [[Keyboard Maestro]] on my Mac, I do sort of have to suck                  |
| 31:23      | an air for a little bit because I look at all the power that it has. And I'm like, whoa, what am I      |
| 31:27      | gonna do here? There's a lot going on here. But when you work through it sometimes with a guide,        |
| 31:32      | like one of yours, David, I can get through it and I can put together little automations.               |
| 31:37      | And I'll give you a perfect example of one that I use all the time. The way that I work,                |
| 31:42      | and this is strange, not many people probably work this way, but I use a PC in my office because        |
| 31:46      | I have to use the PC in my office. And I have a laptop computer that I'm staring at right now           |
| 31:51      | because we're talking and I'm in my office talking to you all right now. But my laptop computer is      |
| 31:54      | closed. It's connected to an external monitor, an external keyboard. And I never move it. I mean,       |
| 32:00      | I always joke that if somebody told me that they taped my laptop to the desk, you know,                 |
| 32:05      | eight months ago, I would not be able to disprove that actually happened because                        |
| 32:08      | it just stays right there. But it doesn't mean that I don't use my laptop because when I work at        |
| 32:13      | home and you know, I tend to work at home at night and on the weekends and stuff. And what,             |
| 32:17      | you know, I definitely need to access things on my PC, but I don't want to have to lug my PC back       |
| 32:22      | and forth and everything else. And so what I use is, well, before I talk about [[Keyboard Maestro]],        |
| 32:26      | I use something called log me in, which is just one of the many remote access software options          |
| 32:31      | that are out there, like go to my PC or something like that. And it allows me to access my computer     |
| 32:36      | from wherever I am, often using a Mac or an iPad. And so when I travel, 99% of the time that I travel,  |
| 32:44      | well, 100% of the time that I travel, I take an iPad with me. And most of the time, I don't             |
| 32:49      | bother taking that PC because I know that if I need to get something done on my computer,               |
| 32:53      | like something using the specific document management software I was talking about before,              |
| 32:57      | I just fire up my iPad and then just use log me in to connect to the PC, which is always on in my       |
| 33:03      | office and do what I need to do. But getting the access can be a little difficult. And this was a       |
| 33:09      | perfect use of [[Keyboard Maestro]], especially a skill that you all have talked about before,              |
| 33:14      | which is [[Keyboard Maestro]]'s ability to actually look at a part of a screen. Because when you have       |
| 33:19      | apps and log me in on the Mac as an example of it, it's an app that does not really want to be          |
| 33:24      | automated. But that's okay, because [[Keyboard Maestro]], let's me get around that. I can just              |
| 33:28      | tell [[Keyboard Maestro]], you know, when I press one key, I want you to log me into my Mac at my           |
| 33:34      | office. And if I don't use [[Keyboard Maestro]], that takes like 15 steps of clicking here and              |
| 33:40      | moving here and waiting for this and typing this in and doing all that nonsense. But with the shortcut  |
| 33:46      | through [[Keyboard Maestro]], I can just type one little special combination of keys, and it will           |
| 33:51      | start the program. And then it will wait for, you know, something to appear on this part of the         |
| 33:56      | screen, which means it's writing for input. And then it can type my username, and it can do this        |
| 34:00      | and go here and type there, and then get to the PC and log into the PC. And all of those steps that     |
| 34:05      | I do just about every single day of my life, sometimes multiple times, it just does it automatically.   |
| 34:12      | And it would not work, but for, well, that magic you talked about of rows of [[Keyboard Maestro]] being     |
| 34:17      | able to look. And so that is just such a useful set of actions. And it's something that it took         |
| 34:22      | me a while to piece it together. And I had to learn that you had to put like a little timer in,         |
| 34:26      | you know, wait five seconds before you do the next command. But after some trials,                      |
| 34:31      | now it works seamlessly. And I love it. Yeah, the waiting command is really, really useful,             |
| 34:37      | especially if you're using that really great action for click it image, because you can wait            |
| 34:42      | until it appears on your screen. Because I frequently end up using pause until conditions               |
| 34:47      | are met. There's a couple of applications I use where it just takes them a while to launch,             |
| 34:51      | even on an M1, I don't know what they're doing. So I just, you know, activate it and then pause         |
| 34:56      | until it's the front window, please. And then, and then I'm good to go.                                 |
| 35:00      | But even then, sometimes that's not enough, because the front window, maybe the front                   |
| 35:05      | window, but the graphical image is not loaded yet or something. So, so I actually go even               |
| 35:11      | more basic and just add like, add three seconds to the end of that, you know, pause until it's          |
| 35:16      | loaded, wait three seconds, then look, because that's a three second delay, but you're still            |
| 35:20      | way faster than if you were doing it manually. And you can literally just push the button.              |
| 35:25      | Have you done this thing, Jeff, where you push the button to run the automation,                        |
| 35:28      | and then you like, go do something else and come back and find yourself logged in?                      |
| 35:31      | I haven't done that before, but, but I agree with the first thing that you said that you,               |
| 35:36      | when you put those little weights in there, you know, in theory, maybe you're waiting                   |
| 35:40      | one or two seconds more than you needed to, but you overall just save yourself so much time             |
| 35:45      | that I can hit this keyboard combination and then turn and go to get the brief that I'm                 |
| 35:48      | going to riot or my, you know, you know, I do whatever I need to get myself into my work mode           |
| 35:53      | and my Mac because of [[Keyboard Maestro]] is going through all the tedious nonsense of getting             |
| 35:57      | logged in and I love it. The pause until conditions are met. One of the options there is found          |
| 36:02      | image condition, which is really great because then you can say, hey, wait until you find,              |
| 36:07      | found this image, then wait an extra second because sometimes the JavaScript still needs                |
| 36:11      | a bit of time to load or something and then, and then go and that is super useful. Yeah, yeah.          |
| 36:16      | That was the first reason I started using [[Keyboard Maestro]] was to automate that one task,               |
| 36:20      | which used to drive me crazy, but I've found it useful for other reasons too. I mean, I like the        |
| 36:24      | application switcher that's part of [[Keyboard Maestro]] as an alternative to that to the Mac's             |
| 36:28      | built-in application switcher. I like that you can do other simple ones like I have a simple            |
| 36:32      | little automation that every time I use Microsoft Word on my computer and I'm using Word every day      |
| 36:38      | because I have a 27 inch iMac screen at home. It's a huge screen and Microsoft Word by default          |
| 36:45      | wants to open in sort of a little window, a smaller window with things, you know, a little              |
| 36:48      | bit smaller to see. And so I just have a very simple [[Keyboard Maestro]] that says anytime you see         |
| 36:53      | Microsoft Word start, then just pause for a second and a half and then resize the front window to,      |
| 37:00      | I think I use like 1700 by 1200, which is a nice size on my screen that it doesn't                      |
| 37:04      | take up the full screen. So I can still sort of get to my desktop on the side there,                    |
| 37:07      | but it takes up most of my screen and it's perfect. And I, you know, it means that just                 |
| 37:12      | anytime I start Microsoft Word, [[Keyboard Maestro]] worries about putting it into the mode that looks      |
| 37:16      | right for me. And I love that. And so that's a nice little useful command whenever you start            |
| 37:21      | this application, do X, really cool. And the nice thing about this, Jeff, is you're building a skill    |
| 37:27      | set around that app. So, you know, I'm sure it took you a while the first time you set up that login    |
| 37:33      | script, but now you've got, you understand how those tools work. And it took you a while the            |
| 37:38      | first time you said, you know, trigger something on an app launching, but now in the back of your       |
| 37:42      | head, you know, hey, that's something I can do. If, you know, if I have another use for that,           |
| 37:47      | it's going to be a lot easier to make it the second time or even maybe I can just duplicate the word    |
| 37:51      | script and, and then, you know, make changes on that. But it is a, as an automator, I feel like         |
| 37:59      | these, this is not a skill set you need to build out immediately. You build it gradually. In fact,      |
| 38:04      | I think that's probably the best way to do it. Agreed. So as somebody though that is relatively         |
| 38:09      | new to [[Keyboard Maestro]], how did you find that experience of making that first script, like             |
| 38:14      | the login script for your, your remote access? Was it, was it overly difficult? I mean,                 |
| 38:20      | what were your pain points? Well, I mean, what made it easy for me is, you know, following a guide      |
| 38:25      | first. And again, I feel like I'm trying to compliment you, David. It wasn't my intention,              |
| 38:28      | but you did have that [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide. So I was able to follow your examples and, you      |
| 38:34      | know, do exactly what you do. And once, once I had created some of your, your examples, examples        |
| 38:40      | that I frankly wasn't going to use in my everyday life, but just seeing how things piece together       |
| 38:44      | and that you move in components, then that, you know, you got to sort of start, you know,               |
| 38:48      | once you've done it, you know, we learned to do things by doing them. And once you do it,               |
| 38:51      | that sort of, you know, teaches you how to do the next thing. And again, I've done the same thing       |
| 38:55      | for, you know, I have a website and I've had it since 2008, but I am, I'm the last thing I would        |
| 39:00      | call myself as a programmer. So every once in a while, if I have to jump into the CSS portion           |
| 39:04      | of my website, you know, what do you, what do I do? You search on the internet for, how did             |
| 39:07      | somebody else do this? And how can I, how can I, you know, steal what they did copy that and            |
| 39:12      | just modify it to do what I do? So once, once you sort of see how something works the first time,       |
| 39:16      | then you can slowly modify it. And that's, and that's absolutely my advice to other folks.              |
| 39:20      | Because again, if you just purchase [[Keyboard Maestro]] and just start using it, you're going to see       |
| 39:25      | so many commands, you're going to be so overwhelmed that you might be discouraged into not starting.    |
| 39:29      | But, but actually get in there and do some things. And you're right, I'm no longer scared to try to     |
| 39:34      | create something to do the next thing. And I realised that there's probably a million things            |
| 39:38      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] could do that I still don't know about yet. But that's okay. I learned a little        |
| 39:43      | bit here in the next month, I learned something else. And before you know it, you're making things      |
| 39:46      | that are pretty complex. This episode, Automators is brought to you by Doppler. In software             |
| 39:52      | development, secrets are private pieces of information that are just keys to not protect                |
| 39:56      | your resources or sensitive information. So you can imagine the stressful days of configuring,          |
| 40:01      | managing and sharing secrets across different teams and clouds. Well, those days are over.              |
| 40:06      | Introducing Doppler, the first universal secrets platform. It enables developers to automate            |
| 40:12      | away the pain of managing secrets and EMV files, which are a hidden type of file used for working       |
| 40:17      | with secrets. Doppler is your team's central source of truth secrets and app configuration              |
| 40:22      | across all environments and clouds. Whether your secrets are in Docker, AWS, Versailles,                |
| 40:27      | or anywhere else, Doppler works where you work. And as your stack evolves, Doppler remains simple.      |
| 40:33      | More than 11,000 customers across all company sizes from startups to large enterprises                  |
| 40:38      | use Doppler so they can keep their secrets and app configuration in sync across devices,                |
| 40:43      | environments and team members. Say goodbye to EMV files, set up Doppler for your team in less           |
| 40:49      | than four minutes. Sign up at Doppler.com/L slash Automators. And that's all the lowercase.       |
| 40:56      | That's Doppler.com/L slash Automators, all lowercase. Go there now. Our thanks to Doppler         |
| 41:03      | for their support of this show and Relay FM. So, Jeff, have you dipped into the waters of [[HomeKit]] yet? |
| 41:12      | I have. And, you know, the automation stuff we've been talking about so far has been sort               |
| 41:16      | of like getting work done, which is important and is great and makes you feel good when you're          |
| 41:19      | efficient. But [[HomeKit]] is like where I love to have fun with automation. And this is the one            |
| 41:24      | that sort of brings a smile on my face more. I love doing it. One of the big [[HomeKit]] things             |
| 41:30      | that I have in my house are the Lutron lights that anyone who's listened to this podcast has            |
| 41:34      | heard. People talk about a million times, but I love the Lutron system because they work really         |
| 41:38      | well. They're incredibly dependable. And so, you know, of course, the first thing that I ever did       |
| 41:43      | when I set them up is to have the lights in the front of my house, you know, come on at sunset          |
| 41:49      | or you can put a certain amount of time before or after that and then go off at sunrise. And,           |
| 41:54      | you know, that's something that we had tried to do through various ways in the past and sometimes       |
| 41:58      | manually. And it's just so nice to have that happen automatically. So it's the most simple              |
| 42:02      | automation, but it's really nice. But I've got a bunch more too and I'll just go through some of        |
| 42:07      | them that I enjoy using. One of them is in the, we have a room in our house with our TV, our TV         |
| 42:13      | room. And I have one of the Eve motion sensors in there so that when somebody walks into the room       |
| 42:19      | if the lights are off, it will notice the motion and then turn the lights on. And it's simple,          |
| 42:24      | but it makes you feel like, oh, this is really cool. You know, how nice are the room to turn            |
| 42:28      | lights on for me? So it's a fun little automation. But one of the things I learned very quickly is      |
| 42:32      | that fun automation. You kind of really think about it because you don't want to have lights coming     |
| 42:38      | on and off just because motion is triggered in a room. Because if you're watching TV and you have       |
| 42:43      | the lights off and you happen to throw your hands up in the air of, oh my God, can you believe what     |
| 42:47      | I just saw? You don't want all the lights to come out of the room. That would totally ruin the          |
| 42:50      | experience. So there's a number of ways that you need to work with that, you know, and there's          |
| 42:54      | different approaches. You know, one of the things that I've done that has solved it for me is to        |
| 42:59      | set a duration in the Eve app. And there's a setting in there that I have a duration of two             |
| 43:04      | hours. And it basically means that I need to have a full two hours of no motion being detected at all   |
| 43:10      | before this automation would ever kick in. And, you know, for me, that's actually been enough           |
| 43:16      | that it's never come on automatically. I thought I might have to push it back to three hours or         |
| 43:20      | something, but that actually did it. So if I walk into my TV room and the lights come on,               |
| 43:25      | and then I walk out and turn the lights off, and I come back in very quickly, I'm not going to have     |
| 43:29      | the same, you know, effect of the lights coming on, but that really happens pretty rarely. So,          |
| 43:33      | you know, the automation may be 90% effective, but that 90% of the time, I like it. And the other       |
| 43:38      | people in my family thinks it's cool too. So that's a phone that I enjoy using.                         |
| 43:43      | Yeah. And it's really hard doing something like that when you've got other people that live with        |
| 43:46      | you, right? Because like, what if you are watching the movie and then suddenly just somebody else       |
| 43:50      | walks in the room and you lose the mood because the lights just like snapped on? That's actually        |
| 43:57      | a very good solution to set a duration timer. And you're doing that in the Eve app, right?              |
| 44:03      | In the Eve app, yeah. You know, there are some things with [[HomeKit]] that you can do in the               |
| 44:06      | manufacturer specific app, but not the Home app. And then there are some things that are in the Home    |
| 44:10      | app. I think this is an example of one that you need to have the manufacturer specific app come         |
| 44:15      | on. Yeah. Though I do think in general, the Eve app, even if you don't have Eve hardware, it does       |
| 44:21      | have some options that the Home app doesn't have for automations, like adding conditions to things.     |
| 44:27      | You can also do this with Home plus or controller for [[HomeKit]] and other things. I've solved the         |
| 44:32      | lights coming on during a film by integrating my TV as well. And so when the TV starts playing          |
| 44:37      | something, then it dims the lights and closes the curtains and things like that. And then when it       |
| 44:43      | finishes, it reopens it. You can't just say that. You just can't say that, Rose. I've been playing      |
| 44:48      | with [[Home Assistant]] a bit, David. Maybe we'll do a future show on it. But just real quick,              |
| 44:52      | how are you using your TV as a trigger? So specifically, because I'm using [[Home Assistant]]               |
| 45:00      | for this, you can tell when the Apple TV starts playing something and when it pauses. And so I          |
| 45:07      | actually use that, which means that if I pause for a bathroom break, then the lights come back on.      |
| 45:11      | But yeah, and that's pretty cool.                                                                       |
| 45:14      | But what a tease. Rose may work for this.                                                               |
| 45:17      | I know. But I mean, we don't have time to do an entire show on [[Home Assistant]] inside of an episode.     |
| 45:22      | But yeah, it is like things like, for example, yeah, like lights coming on in the bedroom in            |
| 45:27      | two o'clock in the morning because your motion sensor saw you move in bed and it's like, oh,            |
| 45:31      | hey, I'll turn on the lights because it's dark. That's not very helpful. So you do have to figure       |
| 45:36      | out like the right duration for things like that or the right positioning of the sensors or all of      |
| 45:41      | the above. And let me just tease further. Rose has convinced me to order [[Home Assistant]]. Mine           |
| 45:47      | hasn't arrived yet. There will be a whole show on it. So just stay tuned. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.             |
| 45:53      | All right. Sorry, Jeff. Sorry, Jeff. I'll share one more that I enjoy using. And this is another        |
| 45:57      | sort of a lights one. A lot of these home kit things have to do with lights coming on and off           |
| 46:00      | for me. But one that I like is a couple of months ago, we purchased at my house these                   |
| 46:06      | things called a Eufy Cam. It's just a camera, you know, a camera for the outside of the house.          |
| 46:10      | And I've got one in my front yard, pointed out my front yard. And I've got one pointed at my            |
| 46:14      | backyard. This isn't really an automation thing. But I have to admit, since I've had them, I think      |
| 46:18      | it's really cool that I can just use my iPhone or iPad or whatever Mac or Apple TV even. And you        |
| 46:24      | know, you can very easily see what's going on in the front of your house, what's going on in the        |
| 46:28      | back of your house. I've liked it because it's cool. And my wife, who's not very techie, she            |
| 46:34      | likes it just to know what's going on. So anything that can please both of us, you know, is a real      |
| 46:38      | hit. So, you know, I've been very happy with Eufy Cam Pro. But one of the, or Eufy Cam 2,               |
| 46:43      | but one of the things that it does is it has a motion detector on it, much like the Eve device          |
| 46:47      | I was talking about. So I have an automation, an automation setup that for the one that's pointed       |
| 46:52      | at my backyard, the way that my backyard is set up is you walk out of the back of our house,            |
| 46:56      | and there's something that used to be a separate building garage, we now just, we don't use it          |
| 47:01      | for cars anymore. We now just use it for storage and stuff. But, you know, sometimes at nighttime,      |
| 47:05      | you'll walk out there to go get something. You know, we have a second freezer back there,               |
| 47:09      | and you might go grab something from the second freezer. And you don't want to have to go through       |
| 47:12      | the trouble of getting lights on and everything else. And so it's nice that with, you know,             |
| 47:16      | two things that we can do. First of all, we can just, you know, just using the regular built-in         |
| 47:20      | home stuff, we can tell Siri, hey, you know, turn on the lights in the garage. And that's great         |
| 47:26      | because it turns on the external lights, it turns on the inside lights. This is all just with           |
| 47:30      | neutron switches. Nothing complicated about it, but it works great. But another thing is I have         |
| 47:34      | it set up with a motion detector on the UV cam that if motion is detected in my backyard,               |
| 47:41      | and if it's 30 minutes after sunset, all the way to 30 minutes before sunrise. So basically,            |
| 47:46      | when it's dark, what I want you to do is turn on the lights that are in front of my garage,             |
| 47:51      | which basically, you know, provides some illumination throughout the backyard so that you               |
| 47:55      | can see what's going on. And this simple automation is nice for a number of reasons.                    |
| 48:00      | I mean, first of all, if I'm walking out in the backyard, it's nice to have lights come on              |
| 48:04      | automatically, much like, you know, walking my TV room. So, you know, you don't trip and fall,          |
| 48:07      | you can see what's going on. But it's also sort of like a security device too, if someone else is       |
| 48:11      | back there, which hopefully would never happen. But if, you know, the bad guy is in my backyard,        |
| 48:15      | and the lights suddenly come on because he's there, my hope is that that would be a form of             |
| 48:19      | deterrence. But it's also nice because it improves the quality of the recording that I get from the     |
| 48:25      | eufycam 2 Pro of backyard activity because it has a night vision on it, which actually works really      |
| 48:32      | a lot better than I ever thought that night vision would work on a camera. I guess it uses              |
| 48:36      | infrared or something like that. But what's even better than night vision is, you know,                 |
| 48:40      | day vision, when you actually have real lights on, because that way, you know, should anything          |
| 48:44      | happen. And we had to adjust it because when at the high sensitivity, it might, you know, pick up       |
| 48:50      | like, you know, an animal, a cat walking in the backyard or something like that. But once you           |
| 48:54      | figure out what the appropriate motion detection level is, now it works great. So there's a number      |
| 49:00      | of reasons that this little automation, you know, when you see things in the backyard, go ahead and     |
| 49:05      | turn on the lights and it's going to record it through the eufycam. Really nice. Yeah, I really          |
| 49:10      | like the eufycam products. I've got several of their indoor and outdoor cameras. I also bought           |
| 49:15      | one of the, a couple of the eufycam spotlights, where it's a LED spotlight with an incorporated          |
| 49:23      | camera that saves locally on device. And it is not part of [[HomeKit]]. They have not connected to          |
| 49:29      | [[HomeKit]]. I'm hoping that Rose's encouragement to buy me, for me to buy a home assistant will help       |
| 49:34      | that. But it is, I have generally been pretty happy with the UV stuff. It's not super expensive.        |
| 49:42      | And it seems to be pretty reliable. Yeah, I found the eufycam is great. I have several of                |
| 49:48      | their indoor cameras. And I have an outdoor camera as well, which I've not got outdoors.                |
| 49:52      | It's inside of a storage cupboard that's attached to the building that I rent. I say                    |
| 49:56      | covered. It's concrete. Either way, it's a great place to put things like garden furniture and          |
| 50:02      | MacBook Pro boxes when you end up ordering an iMac and things like that. And you want to keep the       |
| 50:06      | box because, you know, if you resell it, you get more money. If you've got the box, it's easier to      |
| 50:10      | ship. But the thing that I noticed, and this applies more to indoor cameras than it does to             |
| 50:16      | outdoor cameras, is you can't necessarily use the motion detector and a camera to turn on the lights.   |
| 50:23      | Because what happens if you do it with an indoor camera, with certain positioning, if it's quite        |
| 50:27      | close to the lights, it'll turn on the light and then the lights will turn off. And then it'll          |
| 50:32      | turn on the light because what it's actually doing is it's comparing the number of pixels that change.  |
| 50:38      | And of course, when something goes from light to dark, a lot of pixels change colour. So then it         |
| 50:44      | goes, oh, hey, there's motion. And it turns on your lights. This information may or may not have        |
| 50:49      | been brought to you by a solo 15 minutes of why are my hallway lights turning on and off again?         |
| 50:53      | This is driving me insane. Yeah. And the worst part of it was is I'd set it up on my way to bed.        |
| 51:00      | And so I was lying in bed and like, and the hallway light goes off. And then it flips back on.          |
| 51:05      | And so I turn it off and it flips back on. And oh my gosh, it was driving me up the wall until I        |
| 51:09      | realised, oh, I'm using the camera to trigger that. Maybe I'll just use a regular dumb motion           |
| 51:15      | sensor indoors. That's better. That's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things that depending        |
| 51:20      | on the positioning and how the lights are integrated with that, it can massively affect it. And I       |
| 51:25      | think the outdoor cameras are better at handling that because they've got the night vision as well.     |
| 51:29      | But the indoor cameras, oh, don't do that, people. Don't do that. That was in hindsight hilarious.      |
| 51:36      | But in the moment when I was really tired and cranky and just wanted to go to sleep, it was like,       |
| 51:39      | no, just stop doing this, please, now. So, Jeff, now that you've got a taste for [[HomeKit]],               |
| 51:45      | are there any like [[HomeKit]] problems you're looking forward to solving or thinking about?                |
| 51:49      | No. I mean, it's just adding to things over time. You know, David, you had said something,              |
| 51:53      | I think it was on an automator a very long time ago, or maybe it was pack power users,                  |
| 51:57      | that you started off with [[HomeKit]] just by getting that first, I think for you, just like me, it was     |
| 52:01      | that first Lutron switch, and then you add to it over time, and then now you get another one,           |
| 52:06      | now you get another one. And then the same has been true for me. When I first bought my first           |
| 52:11      | Lutron device, [[HomeKit]] had not even been inventid yet. I think that was in 2015 when it came out.       |
| 52:16      | But then it became [[HomeKit]] compatible, and then I added more and more, and you know,                    |
| 52:21      | through Eve devices or other devices that I have, I mean, they have just slowly started to accumulate   |
| 52:26      | in my house. And I'm not in the same situation where y'all are with all of your water sensors and       |
| 52:32      | all the other things you have, but I'm slowly getting there. And it's just fun that you get one         |
| 52:36      | more thing, you can solve one more problem, or to be fair, just do something that's fun and just        |
| 52:41      | gives me happiness because it works, even if it wasn't necessarily a problem beforehand. So it's        |
| 52:46      | been nice to expand. You know, one of the things I don't know if I regret or not, but I've been         |
| 52:51      | thinking about it because a few months ago, I was so happy with the eufy stuff that I also got the    |
| 52:55      | eufy doorbell, which is nice and works well with the eufy app, but it's not [[HomeKit]] compatible.     |
| 53:01      | And I knew that when I bought it. And of course, at the time, I'm like, well, maybe they'll add         |
| 53:05      | this down the road. So far, I have not yet thought of how, like what I'm missing out on by it not       |
| 53:13      | being [[HomeKit]] compatible, because I don't have any things that just as one example, there's a sensor    |
| 53:19      | on there, like the sensor I have for my backyard. I can't think of anything that I would want to        |
| 53:22      | happen just because it sends activity in my front yard, other than recording, and it already does       |
| 53:26      | that built in. That's what the product does. So I, you know, I don't know that it matters that          |
| 53:31      | it's not [[HomeKit]] compatible. But that is one thing that I think about. But I do feel like going         |
| 53:35      | forward, you know, anything I get in my home with some rare exceptions like that one, you know,         |
| 53:39      | as long as they're either [[HomeKit]] compatible, or I know [[Thread]] is coming, and that's going to be        |
| 53:43      | the next big thing, I feel like as long as I'm, as I have something that works with those systems,      |
| 53:48      | I'll just be able to grow. And, you know, the mesh will increase over time, and you can have even       |
| 53:52      | more triggers. And I still sometimes find myself limited by, you know, why can't I do this on           |
| 53:56      | [[HomeKit]]? Why can't I tell [[HomeKit]] that when something happens to send me a text message,                |
| 54:01      | I don't think that's possible right now at [[HomeKit]]. I am sure there's other ways that y'all can         |
| 54:05      | tell me how to do that using third party stuff or online things. But, you know, I want [[HomeKit]] to       |
| 54:10      | expand and do more. And sometimes I get frustrated that Apple has not been moving more quickly,         |
| 54:16      | but that they are improving it, and it is getting better, which is good.                                |
| 54:19      | I hate to do this to you, Jeff, but I'll tell you what the problem is with your doorbell cam,           |
| 54:24      | because I have the same one as you can't put it on your Apple TV.                                       |
| 54:28      | Oh, actually, that's a good point. Yeah, because what I love on the Apple TV,                           |
| 54:31      | and I'm sure you know this, and folks don't have this, if you have multiple cameras in your house,      |
| 54:35      | there's a way on the Apple TV, you can see just with one screen, all the different cameras at once.     |
| 54:40      | Now, because I have a front yard camera, you know, the additional angle that I would get from a         |
| 54:44      | doorbell camera versus the front yard. I mean, there's so much overlap there that I'm not really        |
| 54:49      | missing out. But yeah, that's the one thing I knew about, and it hasn't been a big deal,                |
| 54:53      | because I've already got one in the front yard. Yeah, if you want to do that on your iPad or            |
| 54:57      | even an iPhone, by the way, I'd recommend HomeCam. It's a great little utility application.             |
| 55:02      | The same person also makes HomeRun, which allows you to more easily do [[HomeKit]] control from your        |
| 55:07      | Apple Watch and HomePass to store all of the QR codes for setting up your devices.                      |
| 55:12      | But one other thing you're missing out on by not having a [[HomeKit]] compatible doorbell                   |
| 55:17      | is chimes on HomePods, because I have a ring doorbell, it's actually the peep hole one,                |
| 55:23      | because I couldn't install something on the outside of my front door, I live in an apartment,           |
| 55:28      | but I could put it through the people. And so I got the ring people, and I'm using Homebridge           |
| 55:34      | to get that into [[HomeKit]], which means that I can see the camera in [[HomeKit]]. And also,                   |
| 55:39      | when it rings, I get chimes on my HomePods throughout the house, which is really, really               |
| 55:43      | nice. That is an excellent point. And I'm looking in my Amazon order history, because just a few        |
| 55:49      | weeks ago, I spent 36 bucks that I would have saved if it had done that, because what I did for         |
| 55:53      | that very same problem is I bought a second eufye doorbell chime. And so now when someone rings          |
| 56:00      | my doorbell, I have the eufye hub, which is downstairs in my house, which goes ding dong.                |
| 56:05      | And then this thing that I bought on Amazon just a few weeks ago, and it's probably literally           |
| 56:09      | only been tested a few times, how many people have rung my doorbell in the last week or two.            |
| 56:13      | But I have this second unit plugged into an outlet upstairs, and so it also dings. But you're           |
| 56:18      | right, I do have HomePod minis in my house, and it would have been nicer if I could have used those     |
| 56:23      | instead of this. So I guess the lack of support cost me an extra 36 bucks.                              |
| 56:27      | Yeah. So yeah, we'll see. From what I've understood, it's actually different                            |
| 56:33      | parts of eufye that do the cameras versus doing the doorbell, even though depending on which             |
| 56:38      | doorbell it is, it connects to the same base station as some of the [[HomeKit]] compatible cameras.         |
| 56:43      | It's a bit of a bit confusing like that. But I think the doorbell comes from the same group,            |
| 56:47      | the work on the robot vacuum, which is also not [[HomeKit]] compatible, though to be fair, at [[HomeKit]],      |
| 56:52      | there is no vacuum support at all. So, you know, that's not eufye's fault there.                         |
| 56:57      | And I know you were kind of making fun of me earlier about my leak detectors, Jeff, but                 |
| 57:01      | I have found religion on these things. I think Rose is the one who really kind of got me to try         |
| 57:06      | the Aqara Hub. Does your toilet leak that often because she may have big problems?                        |
| 57:12      | You don't want to find out the wrong way. That's the thing, right? If there's water,                    |
| 57:16      | it's kind of already a bit too late by the time you notice it. So getting a sensor to say,              |
| 57:21      | you know, that actually your dog stole the flood sensor and is chewing on it is probably better         |
| 57:26      | than finding out your freezer leaked. Everybody knows though, right? I mean,                            |
| 57:29      | know somebody who had, like my sister had a leak, they were out of town for a day and                   |
| 57:34      | they had a leak in the upstairs toilet. And it was like $20,000 worth of damage to the house            |
| 57:38      | because, you know, water is terrible when it leaks. And I thought, you know, 20 bucks and               |
| 57:44      | forever, I know, right? I think I want to like up it and see if I can figure out a way when the         |
| 57:50      | sensor goes off to turn off the water main, but I'm in the research phase on that one. But              |
| 57:55      | that's the thing about home kit, right? Once you, once you nail down lights, then who knows where       |
| 58:00      | you're going to go next. I feel like the next time we have Jeff on automators, he's going to have       |
| 58:03      | door locks and I don't know, Jeff, I know you too well, you're going to go all the way down this        |
| 58:08      | rabbit hole eventually. You got me. This episode of the automators is brought to you by New Relic.      |

| 59:56      | So, Jeff, I know you've been playing with shortcuts and experimenting, and I believe                    |
| 01:00:01   | a little birdie told me that you might have stolen something that David did and made it even better.    |
| 01:00:05   | Can you tell us about this? Because I know a lot of people have got expenses to deal with,              |
| 01:00:10   | and hate receipts, and I'm one of them. So, please tell me how you're improving this.                   |
| 01:00:15   | This is a shortcut that I use just about every day. So, I was talking about how, you know,              |
| 01:00:19   | my first love is not the computers, but it's my iPhone or maybe my iPad too. And I love the idea        |
| 01:00:25   | of using a shortcut to scan receipts, which is an idea that I originally got from you, David,           |
| 01:00:31   | when you had your workflow video field guide back in 2015, which I don't even think is in print         |
| 01:00:35   | anymore. And I don't think you have this shortcut in your current one, but maybe you need to put        |
| 01:00:40   | this in a future one. But you had this shortcut, and it was a perfect example of what I was talking     |
| 01:00:44   | about before. It was a multi-step shortcut that I didn't really understand at the time,                 |
| 01:00:49   | but I followed your directions for, you know, adding it. And then I modified it over time to            |
| 01:00:55   | do what I wanted. And so, you know, what I have is similar to the one that you originally described     |
| 01:01:00   | in, you know, back in 2015, but I use it every day. And so, here's what it does. This shortcut,         |
| 01:01:05   | it scans receipts. So, anytime that I get like a paper receipt from somewhere, which, you know,         |
| 01:01:09   | you get less and less nowadays as things get online. But every time I get a paper receipt               |
| 01:01:14   | at a restaurant or a store or whatever, I use the iPhone, I scan it. It stores it in a specific         |
| 01:01:19   | folder as a PDF file with a name and then with the date and the name of the place. And this is          |
| 01:01:25   | useful to me for so many reasons. I mean, first of all, I can just throw away the paper receipt,        |
| 01:01:29   | and I still have the actual receipt if I need it for, you know, tax purposes or, you know,              |
| 01:01:34   | dealing with the merchant in the future or something like that. But to my surprise,                     |
| 01:01:38   | since I've been using this for so many years, it's also really useful as a way to sort of find          |
| 01:01:42   | out when I went to a restaurant or some other business. And, you know, a good example is,               |
| 01:01:46   | you know, I'm getting takeout dinner from, you know, the XYZ place. I just pulled up the last one       |
| 01:01:51   | or two times I went there in just a second using the files app on my iPhone or iPad. And I can          |
| 01:01:57   | just remind everybody, hey, last time, you know, my son had this, my daughter had this, and like,       |
| 01:02:00   | oh, yeah, you just get the same thing. And it's just, it's nice to be able to quickly see that.         |
| 01:02:05   | So that's the why of this is so useful. The formula is, you know, it's a little complex,                |
| 01:02:10   | and I send it to you all, maybe it can be attached to the show links or something like that.            |
| 01:02:15   | But there's basically, you know, three steps to it. I mean, the first thing that I do                   |
| 01:02:18   | is I trigger the shortcut. And let me just pause right here. Originally, I just had one of these        |
| 01:02:23   | shortcuts. But I learned over time that it was more efficient for me to split it into two different     |
| 01:02:28   | shortcuts. And the reason for this is the way that I trigger the shortcut pretty much all the time      |
| 01:02:33   | is I have on the face of my iPhone, I have a widget, the shortcuts widget, it's pretty nice.            |
| 01:02:40   | And I have it on my second page. So it's the largest version of the widget you can have like,           |
| 01:02:44   | I think eight different shortcuts there. And so I have two buttons. And if I press one button,          |
| 01:02:49   | it's the button I use if it's a place that I've been to before. And that way, when I click the          |
| 01:02:53   | button, it brings up a list of those places I've been to before, you know, this restaurant that I       |
| 01:03:00   | go to frequently or the store I go to a lot. So I don't have to manually type in the name of,           |
| 01:03:05   | you know, Commander's Palace restaurant or something, I can just tap Commander's Palace,                |
| 01:03:09   | and it knows that's where I went. And then the next thing I do is tap on the date,                      |
| 01:03:13   | and it knows the date. And then it formats all of that. And the format of like, you know,               |
| 01:03:17   | oh, then I have to take a picture, take a picture of the receipt, and it takes a picture and it         |
| 01:03:21   | automatically formats it. And what I end up with is this picture that was taken and converted to        |
| 01:03:26   | PDF format and resized to something that it's not crazy big, it's like, you know, a 999 width.          |
| 01:03:32   | And it's got the title of the file is the date like 2022-01-04 for January 4th,                         |
| 01:03:42   | and then a dash, and then the name of the place, which is taken from that list that I just tapped       |
| 01:03:47   | on it. And then now it's, you know, the whole process has taken me a second, I'm not a second,          |
| 01:03:52   | maybe three seconds total, to tap the place I went, take the picture and have it saved appropriately.   |
| 01:03:58   | And then it's there. And then I have it, and it's great. And if there's a place that I find that        |
| 01:04:02   | I'm going to, you know, frequently, I will open up the edit feature for this particular shortcut.       |
| 01:04:08   | And at the very, very top of the shortcut is a list function that are followed by the entries           |
| 01:04:13   | that I just have manually sorted in alphabetical order. And so if I, you know, if there's a restaurant  |
| 01:04:17   | called, you know, DD's Cafe that I go to a lot, I can just type in once DD's Cafe and put in            |
| 01:04:23   | alphabetical order. And then I'll never have to type those words again, it will always be there         |
| 01:04:27   | in the future for me to tap on and choose it. And I love that shortcut. And I mentioned that            |
| 01:04:31   | has a twin, the other version of the shortcut, which is the button right next to it, is if it's         |
| 01:04:35   | a sort of a one off place that's not in my list. It's the same automation, but instead of me tapping    |
| 01:04:41   | the name of the vendor, it actually has a text input field where I type the name of the vendor.         |
| 01:04:47   | And if I find myself using the shortcut too often for a particular vendor, I'll put it into the         |
| 01:04:51   | other one. But I mean, I use this all the time, it is useful to me all the time. And it just,           |
| 01:04:57   | it's funny to me that something that I originally started just as a way to save a receipt without       |
| 01:05:01   | having to worry about saving the paper, I had no idea it was going to be so useful as sort of like      |
| 01:05:06   | this this log of places I've gone in the past, you know, how long has it been since we ordered          |
| 01:05:10   | from this restaurant? Well, I can tell you exactly how long it's been. What did we get that we really   |
| 01:05:15   | love last time we were there? Well, I can just look at the receipt and tell you exactly what we         |
| 01:05:18   | got. We can order it again. It's useful. I love it. Yes. Yeah. And I would suggest you could even       |
| 01:05:24   | make more versions of this, like if you had work expenses, like, and you want to just get those         |
| 01:05:30   | receipts, you could make a version that saves it to a separate folder so you that gets shared with      |
| 01:05:36   | your work or [[Dropbox]] your work or whatever. Great idea. Another way you could do that is like you       |
| 01:05:42   | could tie it all into one. You're like, is it one of these or do you want to type in a name? But        |
| 01:05:47   | I actually do think the idea of making multiple versions so you don't make the shortcut as complex      |
| 01:05:53   | and and you make basically make the election by which button you push so long as you have room          |
| 01:05:58   | for the buttons is in a lot of ways superior because you don't have to monkey around with               |
| 01:06:03   | that stuff or creating user interface and shortcuts, which really doesn't have very many                |
| 01:06:08   | tools to create user interface. Yeah, I actually did it that way at first, David, that my first         |
| 01:06:12   | version of the shortcut, the first thing it did when you opened it is it asked you a question,          |
| 01:06:16   | is this a favourite or is this a new one? But most of the time I find myself using favourite.             |
| 01:06:22   | And I'm like, that sort of seems wasteful that I'm tapping that favourite button every time I            |
| 01:06:25   | start the shortcut. And if I found that by having two different shortcuts, you're basically cutting     |
| 01:06:30   | one step out. And that doesn't sound like a lot of time. But considering that it's a shortcut that      |
| 01:06:34   | only takes about a couple seconds anyway, you know, cutting out an extra button that you have to tap,   |
| 01:06:39   | that makes a big deal. Yeah, one of the things that I would suggest that it's potentially worth         |
| 01:06:46   | looking into for this is actually splitting this up a bit more and having the bulk of the actions       |
| 01:06:52   | in a separate shortcut, the only use with one shortcut. And one of the things that occurs to            |
| 01:06:56   | me with, for example, your favourites is I guess your favourites is a list and you're using the           |
| 01:07:00   | choose from list action with that. But one of the things you could do is actually you could just        |
| 01:07:07   | have that in a shortcut, which then takes whatever you've chosen and passes it to a run shortcut,       |
| 01:07:13   | which is the other shortcut. Because what happened in iOS 15 is when you ask, so you can say a          |
| 01:07:20   | shortcut accepts input. And this is something most people have probably used before. It's with          |
| 01:07:26   | the show in share sheet option. And then you can say, I only want to select receive text input.         |
| 01:07:32   | And if there's no input, ask for. And then it can ask you specifically for text. And then what would    |
| 01:07:39   | happen is if you use a run shortcut, and you so you start with a shortcut that's got a list,            |
| 01:07:44   | choose from list, and then it's run shortcut, and it passes whatever your list option is                |
| 01:07:49   | through to the next shortcut, then that will, you know, skip the asking you for what is this place.     |
| 01:07:54   | And then if, but if you haven't done it, and you just run that shortcut directly,                       |
| 01:08:00   | then it asks you. And the reason why I say this is because I have found before, if I have multiple      |
| 01:08:05   | versions of the same kind of shortcut, I end up needing to make a sub shortcut. Because otherwise,      |
| 01:08:12   | my versions diverge, I make an improvement in one, I forget to make another. So I've tried to use       |
| 01:08:17   | sub shortcuts wherever I can as sort of a sub routine to keep the core logic the same,                  |
| 01:08:22   | wherever possible, just because otherwise I end up with, oh, wait, why isn't this saving to the         |
| 01:08:26   | folder? I'm sure I changed the folder. Oh, right. I changed the folder in the other version of this     |
| 01:08:30   | shortcut, and I didn't change it here, and so on and so forth. And this bites me in all sorts of        |
| 01:08:35   | places in keyboard, my store and shortcuts and so on. And so I'm trying to break things down into       |
| 01:08:40   | the smaller subsections that I can reuse again and again. Yeah, that's a great idea. If I was           |
| 01:08:44   | preparing it from scratch today, I would absolutely do that. But as you mentioned, that feature didn't  |
| 01:08:49   | even come out to what iOS 15 last year, and I've been using a version of this shortcut for like         |
| 01:08:53   | six years now. So yeah, and I can tell that this was based on that one I did because you're setting     |
| 01:08:58   | variables, which you don't do anymore in shortcuts. Now it's all magic variables. This is the part      |
| 01:09:03   | where Jeff regrets sharing this with us, because we're going to start taking it apart for him.          |
| 01:09:07   | No, actually, that's the good thing, because it's always like that's what you want to do is evolve      |
| 01:09:10   | things over time and make them better. And absolutely, that's that's the fun of it. So one              |
| 01:09:14   | suggestion I have is throw a few bucks at the toolbox pro guy and download the tool box.                |
| 01:09:18   | I have to box trip. So I already have it. So what can I do with that?                                   |
| 01:09:22   | Take a photo, use the toolbox pro scan document command and see how that works for you.                 |
| 01:09:28   | Okay, what's the advantage of doing that? Because it uses the built in document scanner that the        |
| 01:09:32   | iPhone has. So it'll snap it to the edges of the receipt and so on so that you don't have like the      |
| 01:09:36   | table in the background and things like that, which is awesome. Okay, that's what I'm going to do.      |
| 01:09:41   | Thank you. Well, the other thing that I would suggest is Data Jar. Okay, you've got all of these        |
| 01:09:45   | places with the, with your favourites. Why not just have a list in Data Jar, and then Data Jar           |
| 01:09:50   | can just pull that out. And it's really easy, then you don't have to edit a shortcut, you just open     |
| 01:09:54   | Data Jar. And you, you, I don't know, you could call it, you know, my, my expense places or something   |
| 01:10:01   | like that. And then you can just have a list. And then you can just get that, get that item,            |
| 01:10:07   | and then choose from those. And that is Data Jar rows. I don't know what that means.                    |
| 01:10:10   | So Data Jar is essentially, it was a free app that you can download on the app store,                   |
| 01:10:14   | I'll put a link to it in the show notes is at Data Jar.app. But it's apparently to store                |
| 01:10:19   | variables that you can use again and again and again between shortcuts. Now toolbox pro also            |
| 01:10:23   | has global variables, but Data Jar has an advantage in that it's very specifically just data. And it    |
| 01:10:31   | works on all the platforms that even works on the Mac, if you're running shortcuts on the Mac,          |
| 01:10:35   | and it's great for getting things out. And you can, you can do files and stuff in there too.            |
| 01:10:39   | But what I would suggest for this is when, if you add a variable to Data Jar, just make it a            |
| 01:10:44   | list of expense places, and then you can put every single item within that list. And that would be      |
| 01:10:50   | all of your places. And that would be super easy to maintain. And you could even use it elsewhere       |
| 01:10:54   | if you needed to, instead of just having all that information in one shortcut.                          |
| 01:10:58   | I like it. Sounds good. I mean, the problem with shortcuts is it doesn't remember variables. So         |
| 01:11:02   | it has to relearn them every time you run it. And Data Jar gives it like a place to pull them from.     |
| 01:11:08   | Yeah, which is really useful when you need stuff that you can use again and again and again between     |
| 01:11:13   | shortcuts. Yeah, this is like your old Timex Sinclair. Didn't remember the variables near the           |
| 01:11:18   | shortcuts. I guess what we need is a thermal printer for shortcuts. I guess that's what we              |
| 01:11:23   | really need. There we go. Yeah. I know that's not the only thing you do with shortcuts, though.         |
| 01:11:28   | Yeah, I'll mention a couple more. Here's two short ones. One that I use, this is another one I stole    |
| 01:11:32   | from you, David, that was from one of your field guides way back when for calculating dates. It         |
| 01:11:36   | was just a very simple shortcut that, you know, you can either calculate the number of dates            |
| 01:11:40   | before something or after something. And as a lawyer, I often have like an order from a court           |
| 01:11:45   | that something is due 45 days before another date and my brain can't calculate what 45 days is.         |
| 01:11:51   | So I just use this simple shortcut that I select, you know, either days before                          |
| 01:11:55   | or days after or days between. And I put in the target date and enter the number of days,               |
| 01:11:59   | like 45 days. And it quickly shows me, you know, 45 days before March 16th is XYZ, whatever.            |
| 01:12:06   | And I use that one a lot. It's really nice. I talk about and write about date calculators               |
| 01:12:11   | all the time. And that is an element of being a lawyer. And the occasionally I get an email             |
| 01:12:17   | from a listener like, how come you like did all this stuff about date calculators who cares?            |
| 01:12:22   | I'm like, you don't understand. There is a group of people that listen to me that want                  |
| 01:12:26   | date calculators more than anything else. And shortcuts can do it. So that's good.                      |
| 01:12:32   | So much so that I've actually tried, you can buy or download for free sometimes apps from               |
| 01:12:36   | the app store that are date calculators. And I have yet to find one that works as well as               |
| 01:12:41   | the simple shortcut. So, you know, why use an app if the shortcut does it great.                        |
| 01:12:44   | So here's another one that I'll mention. And this was one that really saved my bacon when I went        |
| 01:12:48   | through something that hopefully none of the other listeners have to go through. And that is a          |
| 01:12:52   | hurricane. I live in New Orleans. So, you know, we have hurricanes. And on the anniversary of           |
| 01:12:57   | Hurricane Katrina in 2020, we had yet another one on the same day. How pleasant was that?               |
| 01:13:02   | Hurricane Ida. And Hurricane Ida was a bad hurricane. And it's one that I didn't think it               |
| 01:13:08   | was going to be as bad as it turned out to be. And so we did not evacuate my home.                      |
| 01:13:13   | And we were safe. Don't get me wrong. Everything was fine. But one of the things that always happens    |
| 01:13:17   | after a hurricane is you lose power. And one of the things that usually happens is the power comes      |
| 01:13:23   | back pretty quickly. But it didn't happen this time. Hurricane Ida shut down the power in New           |
| 01:13:28   | Orleans. And it was just a gone pecan. And we didn't know when it was going to come back. Turned        |
| 01:13:32   | out it took weeks. And likewise, the cell towers, you know, the power that went to the cell towers      |
| 01:13:38   | went down. So cell service was incredibly spotty. And it was, you know, when you're in                  |
| 01:13:43   | a natural disaster situation, being able to communicate with your loved ones, whether they              |
| 01:13:47   | were also in New Orleans or someone from out of town, you know, that was critically important.          |
| 01:13:51   | And one of the things that I learned is as I happen to use AT&T, but I'm sure it would be               |
| 01:13:56   | true for any carrier, as the carriers were slowly putting their cell towers back online,                |
| 01:14:01   | they were so overwhelmed because everybody was trying to call people and stuff like that,               |
| 01:14:06   | that it was really hard to get a signal. And I learned during that time period that                     |
| 01:14:11   | one of the things that would work is if I put my iPhone into airplane mode,                             |
| 01:14:16   | wait at about 10, 20 seconds, and then turn it off airplane mode. So it got a signal.                   |
| 01:14:21   | It could sometimes not all the times, but it could sometimes grab a signal                              |
| 01:14:25   | and hold on to it long enough for me to get like a text or something out, and then it would often       |
| 01:14:29   | go down again. And again, this is a disaster situation, but I've actually been in situations like,      |
| 01:14:34   | you know, years ago, I remember I would be in a convention in Chicago that you used to go to            |
| 01:14:39   | to David, where if you were in a certain room underground, you know, you get really bad cell            |
| 01:14:43   | phone coverage, but if you turned airplane mode on and off again, you might be able to                  |
| 01:14:47   | grab a signal. So here's where shortcuts come in. Instead of manually tonguing airplane mode on         |
| 01:14:52   | and off and on and off, I just made this simple little three step shortcut that as I was sitting        |
| 01:14:58   | there, you know, doing nothing else with no power or anything. I told my iPhone, here's my formula.     |
| 01:15:03   | Number one, turn airplane mode on. Number two, wait 10 seconds. And number three, turn airplane         |
| 01:15:08   | mode off. And then I created, you know, how you can create a an icon as if it's an app to associate     |
| 01:15:14   | with the shortcut. And I put that right on the front of my iPhone. And so instead of, you know,         |
| 01:15:19   | having to dig deep and on and off and do all these other things, I could just have my phone             |
| 01:15:23   | on my hand, press the app and just sit there and wait for 10 seconds. And it did its thing.             |
| 01:15:28   | And I would look and see, did I get a cell signal? Nope, press it again. And, you know,                 |
| 01:15:34   | it was so much nicer to be able to press one button instead of pressing, you know, a whole              |
| 01:15:37   | bunch of buttons. And then eventually I would get that signal and I could get the message out to        |
| 01:15:42   | my sister and see that she was okay at everyone else. So it was like one of those shortcuts that        |
| 01:15:47   | I created on the fly. And I would love to say I'll never need to use it again. But in a time of,        |
| 01:15:53   | you know, a little bit of panic and a lot of aggravation, being able to make something simple           |
| 01:15:58   | that just, you know, saves you some trouble. Boy, that was really nice.                                 |
| 01:16:01   | Yeah, well, I've got something similar because we have earthquakes here. And when we have an            |
| 01:16:06   | earthquake, I mean, you know, so long as it's not earthquake, it's so bad that it shakes down the       |
| 01:16:10   | cell towers, they don't break. And usually we have power, but the problem is they get flooded           |
| 01:16:16   | as soon as there's an earthquake, everybody's checking in. And I have a shortcut that sends             |
| 01:16:22   | out a text message and gives my location and says I'm okay. And just like gets it out because you       |
| 01:16:28   | have like 30 to 60 seconds before the cell towers break down, you know.                                 |
| 01:16:33   | Is that one you've made available to your Apple Watch, David? Because that seems to me to be a          |
| 01:16:36   | prime candidate for the Apple Watch because not most shortcuts are useless on the Apple Watch.          |
| 01:16:41   | They don't necessarily have the way to input things in the way that we need. But that's                 |
| 01:16:45   | a perfect candidate. Yeah, that's a good one. I should put that one on my Apple Watch. But you          |
| 01:16:49   | know, it's, it's a, you know, it is funny though, how automation can actually be very useful for        |
| 01:16:55   | those types of emergencies, if you think of it ahead of time. The only other one I was going to         |
| 01:16:59   | mention, it's a shortcut that I use all the time is I have a very simple shortcut for logging meals     |
| 01:17:04   | that I do not from like a calorie counting counting way, but just as a way to sort of keep              |
| 01:17:08   | track of what we made for dinner. And I started this one during the COVID when we were, you know,       |
| 01:17:14   | at home every night and, you know, couldn't, but kids were working during school from home and we       |
| 01:17:18   | were home and everything was home. And you know, what else are you going to do with all your time?      |
| 01:17:21   | Let's keep track of what we're making for dinner. And so I just created this very simple shortcut       |
| 01:17:26   | that would have a text prompt of asking what the meal was, and it would ask for the date, which would   |
| 01:17:30   | often be that same date unless I was filling in something from yesterday or something. And then         |
| 01:17:35   | it would find a note in just the notes app on my iPhone that had a specific name like, you know,        |
| 01:17:40   | meals three, if I had, you know, the third one or something like that. And it would append text to      |
| 01:17:44   | that note. And this very simple shortcut would, you know, just with the easy, you know, couldn't        |
| 01:17:49   | be any easier to use. And it would note that, you know, on August 14, we had, you know, lasagne,        |
| 01:17:56   | and on August 15, we had something else. And as silly as it was to sort of track the meals over         |
| 01:18:00   | time, I've actually found that we're now using it, like, you know, my wife and I sit around like,       |
| 01:18:04   | you know, what are we going to have that's upcoming week for dinner? I'll just, you know,               |
| 01:18:07   | look at the note, and you can just simply scroll through this list of, you know, hundreds of            |
| 01:18:12   | meals that we made. And like, oh, yeah, I remember the time we made the section such,                   |
| 01:18:14   | that was really good. Let's make that again. And I even sometimes I'll go back into the note and        |
| 01:18:19   | put a little, you know, heart emoji for the first one that was really good. And it's not                |
| 01:18:23   | unlike what I was talking about with the scanning receipts earlier, that, you know, having these        |
| 01:18:27   | little logs of things that you do in your life that you can later look back and use it in some          |
| 01:18:31   | other useful way. It's really nice. And it's such a simple shortcut. And I really enjoy using it.       |
| 01:18:35   | It's really useful. Yeah, you could also add a thumbs down emoji for any meal that really               |
| 01:18:40   | didn't go to plan and perhaps adding brackets. Why? Because I know I've done this before,               |
| 01:18:45   | where I've bought some stuff to make a full recipe and I made it. I've gone, oh my God,                 |
| 01:18:50   | this is awful. It's got way too much salt in it or something like that, because the recipe said to      |
| 01:18:54   | add salt, but the sauce is pre-salted or something. And so I've taken, you know, I've started adding    |
| 01:19:00   | that information to, I use crouton for my recipes. But I think I should log the food that I've actually |
| 01:19:07   | eaten as well, just because I do forget. And I do tend to eat the same thing most of the time           |
| 01:19:12   | anyway. So it helped for planning my grocery shopping to do that. My wife is a former chef,             |
| 01:19:17   | the primary cook in our house, and everything that she does is excellent. I would never have            |
| 01:19:21   | a need to use a thumbs down Rose for anything that she makes. Oh, in that case, I'm very glad.          |
| 01:19:25   | Certainly I would not let her know, that's for sure. Well, no, no, definitely not. But for me,          |
| 01:19:30   | where occasionally I'm making things and they go horribly, horribly wrong, or I try one of those        |
| 01:19:34   | other meals, it's just like, oh, this is just not good. I really need to stop doing that,               |
| 01:19:38   | because when they're really not good consistently, it's a sign that Rose, you should actually cook      |
| 01:19:42   | food. But there we go. Or you could run the automation to check the who prepared it field,              |
| 01:19:48   | and if it's made by your wife. That's a smart one. It just always gets a thumbs up.                     |
| 01:19:51   | It can automatically pre-populate the thumbs down if I was the chef. It's a good idea.                  |
| 01:19:54   | Thumbs up for you. Thumbs down for me. Well, Jeff Richardson, you said, well, I don't know if I         |
| 01:20:01   | automate enough to justify coming on the show. You just talked for an hour and a half about             |
| 01:20:06   | automation, man. You're an automator. I got news for you. Well, thank you for all the                   |
| 01:20:10   | inspiration that you provide to all of us through the show. It's great to learn how to                  |
| 01:20:14   | improve your life to making little, simple little efficiency things here and there. I love doing        |
| 01:20:18   | it. It's a lot of fun. If you were sitting with me, I'd get you one of those little sheriff badges,     |
| 01:20:21   | but it would say automator right across the face. You said some kind of badge, David. I quite like      |
| 01:20:27   | the idea of having like the automators pin that people can get and show off their amazing               |
| 01:20:32   | automation. That's a word now. Well, I think we got to do just the, you know, like the Captain          |
| 01:20:37   | America Shield logo of the podcast with the big A on it. I think that's what we got to do.              |
| 01:20:42   | That'd be cool. We made pins like that. I think we got to do that. I mean, the question is,             |
| 01:20:47   | is Jeff willing to be our guinea pig for this sort of thing and, you know, give it a whirl and          |
| 01:20:52   | see what the preview models because, you know, we need somebody to test this.                           |
| 01:20:56   | Yeah, we need a beta tester, Jeff. All right. So you can find Jeff at iPhoneJD,                         |
| 01:21:02   | but not just iPhoneJD. Jeff also has an excellent podcast that he makes with my friend, Brett           |
| 01:21:08   | Bernie. Tell us about your podcast, Jeff. Oh, thanks for mentioning it, David. I'm having so            |
| 01:21:11   | much fun with this. We started last year. Brett Bernie is a former practising attorney                  |
| 01:21:16   | and he and I have been friends for a while and we have this podcast that every Friday                   |
| 01:21:22   | we record called In The News and the name comes from on my iPhoneJD.com website. Every Friday,          |
| 01:21:28   | I have sort of a collection of things that I've seen in the news that look sort of interesting          |
| 01:21:32   | and I have a link to them. So even if you're not an attorney, you might want to check it out every      |
| 01:21:35   | Friday, but we use that as a jumping off point where Brett and I talk about the news of the week        |
| 01:21:40   | pretty quickly and then we end up the show with something that any automated listener would love        |
| 01:21:45   | which is a section called In The Know instead of In The News. It's basically our tips of the week       |
| 01:21:50   | and Brett and I each offer a tip for whether it's an automation or an app that we like or a website     |
| 01:21:56   | or something that just makes brings delight to our life. And so if I would love it if folks             |
| 01:22:02   | checked it out. We're having such great fun with the podcast. It comes out around the middle of the     |
| 01:22:06   | day on Fridays here in the United States and it's not a very long podcast, but we're having great       |
| 01:22:11   | fun with it and getting great feedback. So everybody should check that out. It's great.                 |
| 01:22:14   | You can find it at inthenewspodcast.com. What I love about it is the energy. You guys are clearly       |
| 01:22:20   | having a ton of great fun while you make it and it is my weed pulling podcast. I listen to you          |
| 01:22:26   | guys while I pull weeds. So there you go. Check that out and we'll put links in the show notes.         |
| 01:22:32   | We are The Automators. You can find us at relay.fm/automators. You can find                       |
| 01:22:37   | the forums at talk.automators.fm. What else should I link, Rose? Everything else okay?                  |
| 01:22:43   | We got it covered. Well, I think you should probably link people to the MacSparky Labs,                |
| 01:22:47   | you know, because you've been doing some stuff there. And when we were talking to Jeff as part          |
| 01:22:50   | of the planning, he mentioned that he'd been enjoying that. So I feel like maybe you should             |
| 01:22:54   | put a link to that in the show notes. All right. It's a lot of fun. If you ask, then we can do that.    |
| 01:22:58   | And we will see you next time. Have a great day. Bye everyone.                                          |

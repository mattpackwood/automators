| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always                |
| 00:06      | by David Sparks. Hey, David. How are you today?                                                        |
| 00:08      | Hey, Rosemary. How are you? You've moved?                                                              |
| 00:13      | Well, yeah. I've redecorated. I've been to IKEA so many times, it feels like a second                  |
| 00:19      | home, and I have bought pretty much every single smart product they sell. I have blinds                |
| 00:25      | everywhere. I have a robot vacuum that arrived today and is my new best friend. Her name's             |
| 00:29      | Better Cup, in case anyone's interested, that is from the Princess Bride. But yeah,                    |
| 00:33      | I'm automating all of the things, and it's amazing.                                                    |
| 00:36      | We are going to dig deep on that in a future episode. I just want to give you time to kind             |
| 00:41      | of get it all settled, because I think it's going to be nuts, whatever you're going to                 |
| 00:44      | do, and I can't wait to hear about it. Yeah. I mean, it's good because I set up                        |
| 00:48      | some door sensors yesterday, and this morning I woke up and I was like, why is this door               |
| 00:52      | open? It's literally locked. It can't be open. And so I went and I looked at it, and                   |
| 00:56      | the door was indeed still locked shut, and the sensor was on the floor because apparently              |
| 01:00      | I didn't stick it to the door very well, even though I did clean it first. So I've stuck               |
| 01:04      | that one back up, and it seems to be holding now, but we'll see.                                       |
| 01:06      | They had door sensors or cool triggers, though. That's going to be fun.                                |
| 01:10      | Yes. And I've been playing a little bit, and I'm figuring out how to say if the door is                |
| 01:15      | open for more than a minute, because that can be a bit tricky, because I don't want                    |
| 01:19      | the heater to turn off every time the door opens, because I go out the door to take out                |
| 01:22      | the trash or something, and I come back 30 seconds later, I don't need the heating to                  |
| 01:25      | turn off twice while I'm gone. But, you know, there's possibilities.                                   |
| 01:31      | I think that's possible even in Native HomeKit, but let's say that.                                    |
| 01:35      | Yeah. Convert to shortcut. Convert to shortcut is being my friend right now.                           |
| 01:39      | Exactly. All right. Well, what we thought would be fun for today's show is to have two                 |
| 01:45      | automators take a serious look at the widgets that have shown up in iOS 14. We talked briefly          |
| 01:52      | about our home screens on the iOS 14 show. We talked about the shortcuts widget, but                   |
| 01:57      | there's been this amazing bit of, you know, kind of explosion, like a mini gold rush on                |
| 02:04      | the App Store for people making widget apps. And there have been some developers that have             |
| 02:09      | just done an amazing job at implementing widgets for their apps. We're going to talk about             |
| 02:13      | a few of those. But what we really are going to dig deep on today are the widget apps for              |
| 02:19      | making widgets, you know, the kind of the meta level. As automators, this is the kind of               |
| 02:24      | stuff that really pushes our buttons. And Rose and I have gone deep. We've got kind                    |
| 02:29      | of a learning curve on this one. We're going to start with the easy ones. We're going to               |
| 02:32      | get to the hard ones. And by the end, we're going to be writing JavaScript widgets of                  |
| 02:36      | our own. So it's going to be fun. So I guess we should just get started.                               |
| 02:42      | Yeah. Before we do, there's a couple overview things                                                   |
| 02:46      | on widgets that kind of like kind of hangs as like a cloud. Some of them are really pretty             |
| 02:53      | white fluffy clouds and some of them are dark clouds over this whole conversation. You know,           |
| 02:58      | the good thing about these widgets is that they can be really beautiful or ugly, depending             |
| 03:02      | on your preference. And that they're just a great source for quick information on your                 |
| 03:09      | phone. One of the reasons I use some of the widgets I talk about today is just because                 |
| 03:14      | I want glanceable, usable data on my phone. And that's something we've not really had                  |
| 03:20      | before. Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing. Like I'm currently                                        |
| 03:26      | in a phase where the only apps on my home screen are in my dock. I know, David, you've                 |
| 03:30      | done this before, but I've got way more widgets on my home screen than you do. I'm not doing           |
| 03:33      | a big widget and a medium widget. I'm doing two small widgets and two medium widgets.                  |
| 03:38      | And then the dock. Though I may have a Max phone in my future and I believe that will                  |
| 03:43      | give me an extra row of apps to experiment with. But we'll see what happens there.                     |
| 03:47      | Yeah, I mean, halfway through the beta, I just took all the apps off my home screen                    |
| 03:52      | and I've got a few in my dock. And even the ones in my dock don't really need to be there              |
| 03:57      | because they have good widgets. So my, yeah, at this point, and I realise this is kind                 |
| 04:04      | of early in our relationship with widgets, but I am like all in, you know, and I've got                |
| 04:10      | so I've got my home screen is full of widgets. It really only has two, but they're, they're            |
| 04:15      | stocks. And then to the left of that, you know, what we used to call the today view                    |
| 04:20      | has a bunch of widgets. And then on the right side of that, I've just got the app centre.              |
| 04:24      | So it's, it's a very simple setup for me, but the widgets make this possible. And it's                 |
| 04:31      | just also, I think the widgets are a great way to make your phone your phone. I mean,                  |
| 04:36      | we talked on this show a little over a year ago about the hypothetical shortcut to end                 |
| 04:42      | all shortcuts, you know, the one that would take your calendar, turn it into the wallpaper             |
| 04:47      | and save it to the wallpaper of your phone. And that was one both of us had developed.                 |
| 04:54      | And then Apple yanked the carpet from under us by taking away the set wallpaper action                 |
| 04:59      | from shortcuts. So that never happened. I had to cut a bunch out of the shortcuts field                |
| 05:02      | guide because I had already planned to publish on it. But the, but now you get that with,              |
| 05:08      | you know, pick the calendar app of your choice that has a widget and you've got an automatically       |
| 05:13      | updating calendar on your home screen all day. It's just, it's awesome.                                |
| 05:16      | Yeah. And as we'll get to later, you don't even necessarily need to use a specific calendar            |
| 05:20      | app because there's lots of ways to do this. And that's what's really becoming the great               |
| 05:26      | thing about this is even if you don't necessarily want to use, you know, a specific calendar           |
| 05:32      | app, but you like the look of their widget, then there's almost certainly a way for you                |
| 05:36      | to create that view yourself with one of the widget apps we're going to talk about. Though             |
| 05:41      | there are some great apps and actually, especially with the app library, I found myself reinstalling   |
| 05:45      | some apps just because this way I have like one specific shortcut action or a particular               |
| 05:52      | widget view, which I like. And then it's in my app library and I don't use the app. I                  |
| 05:55      | just look at the view. Yeah. One of the apps we're going to cover today is one that lets               |
| 05:59      | you write a shortcut to turn it into a widget, which is amazing. So like that and, you know,           |
| 06:06      | I don't get ahead of myself. We got some cool stuff to talk about in today's show.                     |
| 06:12      | The downside though of the widgets is it's not really interactive. And we've talked about              |
| 06:16      | this on the show a few times now. It's, you know, the data update is slow. Some apps are               |
| 06:23      | worse than others where, you know, using the [[Apple Calendar|calendar]] app as an example, if you change                 |
| 06:28      | your appointments around, there's a chance your calendar on your home screen isn't going               |
| 06:32      | to be up to date. So that's an issue. There is a limitation on the sizes. You know, they've            |
| 06:38      | got the small, medium, large sizes on Android. You can kind of make widgets any way or shape           |
| 06:43      | or form you want and put them anywhere. And Apple kind of has this grid system. I don't                |
| 06:49      | really think that's a negative, but I know some people on the internet do. I kind of                   |
| 06:53      | like it to be clean. So I'm okay with that. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, me too.              |
| 06:59      | I mean, I, on the one hand, I would like to just be able to float anything anywhere. And               |
| 07:03      | that would be great. On the other hand, I want all of the data. You know, I'm very much                |
| 07:09      | a data nerd. If I can get all the data, it makes me happy. So I would much rather just                 |
| 07:14      | have all of the things, you know, right there available for me so that I can, you know,                |
| 07:19      | just grab it all and see it with, you know, one look instead of, you know, one beautifully             |
| 07:24      | positioned photo of my robot vacuum in the middle of my home screen, which I could do                  |
| 07:28      | by taking off all the apps, but, you know, it wouldn't then rotate and turn into my calendar.          |
| 07:33      | That's your robot pet. Let's be honest. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's got a name, so it's a pet.            |
| 07:39      | Yeah, no, I agree. And then the other big downside is just, you know, as beautiful and                 |
| 07:46      | wonderful as widgets are, you get almost no support for them on iPad. And it's so disappointing.       |
| 07:52      | So disappointing. I talked about this on iPad Power Users. Every time I open up my iPad and             |
| 07:57      | I look at all those icons and that one sad widget, which is all you really get is one                  |
| 08:02      | medium size sad widget on this side. Yeah. I mean, you've got to swipe to get any more.                |
| 08:09      | It's just, I don't know what happened there. I don't know. I think, I think they've got                |
| 08:12      | something up their sleeve for like iOS 14.3 or 14.4 or something like that because I like,             |
| 08:19      | I want to get a 12.9 inch iPad pro and the magic keyboard. I'm currently still using                   |
| 08:24      | a smart keyboard or a bridge keyboard with my 11 inch iPad. I've switched between them                 |
| 08:28      | depending on what I'm doing. And I would really, really, really like to upgrade my iPad to             |
| 08:34      | the bigger one. But I feel like my phone can give me more information, despite the fact                |
| 08:41      | that I can literally fit my phone in my hand. I've got the 11 pro. I don't have the max                |
| 08:45      | at the moment, the max is coming back. And, you know, I can fit this in my hand and I                  |
| 08:50      | get more data at a glance from this than I get from my 11 inch iPad. It feels like there's             |
| 08:56      | something wrong there. They really need to fix that. And this will give me more automation             |
| 09:00      | options, of course.                                                                                    |
| 09:01      | And [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] over at [[Mac Power Users]] and I were talking about it. He thinks that they're saving          |
| 09:05      | it for iOS, you know, 14 next year.                                                                    |
| 09:09      | Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens, right? But, you know, maybe 13.3. Yeah, it's nothing               |
| 09:15      | in the current beta, but                                                                               |
| 09:17      | I'm an optimist. I feel like we'll get it sooner. I mean, it's like, I guess we'll find                |
| 09:21      | out, but it seems like how hard can it really be, you know?                                            |
| 09:28      | Every single developer out there going so hard, David, so hard because there's always                  |
| 09:33      | a catch to this stuff. You're always there going, yeah, I could just flip a toggle and                 |
| 09:36      | that would happen and then suddenly everything breaks. But yeah, they've laid the groundwork.          |
| 09:42      | So, you know, we've got the idea of it in principle, the code, at least some of it already             |
| 09:46      | exists. I see why, you know, they might want to say, hey, you should have, you know, a                 |
| 09:52      | couple of columns of apps on your iPad, but at the same time, they're not making me have               |
| 09:59      | a row of apps on my iPhone. So just let me use my device how I want. That's why the Internet's         |
| 10:05      | gone so crazy over iOS 13 because, you know, you can set your device to look exactly how               |
| 10:10      | you want and people are going, you know, completely, you know, all over this. It's great.              |
| 10:15      | And I do think that we will get, I mean, they've got a notice that, and maybe that will hopefully      |
| 10:21      | move the iPad update further down, you know, further up the food chain. Either way, okay,              |
| 10:27      | so that's kind of the thing. And like some of these widgets we're going to talk about                  |
| 10:30      | today, these are real problems. The interactivity issues for some of them is a problem where           |
| 10:35      | you can see data, you can't really interact with it going into the app and the inability               |
| 10:41      | to frequently update. And there's some of these widgets that would be amazing on the                   |
| 10:45      | iPad, but there's just such limited real estate for it that you can't use them. So either              |
| 10:50      | way, let's start with some simple ones. I just want to hat tip to the shortcuts widget.                |
| 10:57      | We talked about that at length on our shortcuts iOS 14. Does that say iOS 14 earlier? Anyway,          |
| 11:04      | I said iOS 14 earlier, I'm ahead of the game, David, where overtime travel is into the future.         |
| 11:09      | It's great here.                                                                                       |
| 11:10      | Yeah, okay. So anyway, so we, we talked about it already in our shortcuts episode. It is               |
| 11:16      | the only interactive one that exists. I still think I'm very happy with that design. I know            |
| 11:23      | some people are a little grumpy that, you know, the buttons are the size of two icons                  |
| 11:28      | instead of one, but it's touch friendly. And as I explained that episode, using choose                 |
| 11:35      | from menu shortcuts, I'm able to easily get everything I need into one set of four buttons.            |
| 11:41      | Yes. Yeah. And I think that's great. You know, with, with a little bit of, you know, careful           |
| 11:47      | thinking and a bit of planning, you can, you can make those four buttons do so many more               |
| 11:52      | things and it works. And let's be honest, the, the thing that you want out of a widget                 |
| 11:57      | is that it either shows you the information that you need or it does the stuff that you                |
| 12:00      | needed to do. Those are the two components for a good widget. I would say, obviously                   |
| 12:06      | you want it to look the way you would like something to look, but, you know, if it doesn't             |
| 12:10      | do what it needs to do, either, you know, presenting that information or taking that                   |
| 12:15      | action, then it's a failure for a widget, I'm afraid.                                                  |
| 12:18      | Yeah. And this, this one gets prime real estate on my, on my home screen, it gets the lowest,          |
| 12:25      | you know, quadrant, uh, on where my thumb always is. So, and maybe it's the most used                  |
| 12:31      | shortcut I, I have because I had launched so many of my things on my phone contextually                |
| 12:36      | through shortcuts buttons. So it's just, you know, like I said, we already talked about                |
| 12:41      | this. We don't need to waste time on today, but good job. Shortcuts scene again.                       |
| 12:45      | I'm very impressed with it. I'm really happy with it. I'm really glad that they, they rolled           |
| 12:49      | this out so that we can only use it because it works great for me.                                     |
| 12:52      | Now you added one to the list here that I think you like, and that's the Siri shortcuts.               |
| 12:57      | I'm sorry, Siri suggestions.                                                                           |
| 12:59      | Siri suggestions. So if, if you, um, add a widget on your phone, um, and then you scroll               |
| 13:04      | down in, in that widget area, then you should be able to see, um, that there should be a               |
| 13:10      | Siri suggestions section. Um, and this allows you to add, so there's either a stack or there's         |
| 13:18      | the app suggestions and the app suggestions is such a great widget. So this is one you                 |
| 13:23      | can't stack. Now that's the only flaw with this widget, but it will put eight app icons                |
| 13:30      | in a space and it will update them based on what it thinks you want to do throughout the               |
| 13:34      | day. So those app icons will constantly change. Um, and that for me has been great. That's             |
| 13:39      | on my second page. Um, and I love the fact that those, those eight apps just change themselves         |
| 13:44      | out throughout my day. Yes, you can access the same thing by pulling down an opening                   |
| 13:48      | spotlight, but if I'm looking at information and then it's just like, Oh yeah, and I actually          |
| 13:51      | do want to open the home app. Thanks Siri. You know, that, that's great. So I get to                   |
| 13:56      | it through spotlight. So I've never used that, that, um, that widget because I just didn't             |
| 14:01      | want to give up that precious space. And I understand why it's not stackable because                   |
| 14:05      | it's got such a different look, but there you go. Uh, one of the things we didn't mention              |
| 14:11      | on the negatives of these apps that I think drives me a little crazy is listing the name               |
| 14:17      | of the underlying app under the widget. Just, there's a part of me that hates that. Right?             |
| 14:22      | Yeah. Me too. Me too. I, I mean, I, I both love it because it means that when people                   |
| 14:27      | take screenshots, um, either they have to Photoshop every single name out or they don't.               |
| 14:32      | And so then you actually know which apps that they use to create all of this. Yeah. And                |
| 14:35      | that's good for developers. So that there is a plus to that. I'm sure David Smith is                   |
| 14:39      | very happy that widget Smith appears on every home screen these days. Oh yeah. Exactly.                |
| 14:44      | Um, but at the same time, just for the, the cleanliness of my home screen, I would really              |
| 14:49      | like it if I could hide those app, uh, app names, but you know, it's okay. I can live                  |
| 14:53      | with it. They're not that many anymore. Yeah. Uh, I'll tell you, one of the native app widgets         |
| 14:59      | that I think deserves call out is Fantastical. Um, they just, you know, they've always               |
| 15:05      | got a good eye for design over there. And I think they just really did a great job with                |
| 15:11      | these widgets and you know, the Apple calendar app widgets were fine, but as soon as I saw             |
| 15:18      | the Fantastical widgets, it immediately replaced them on my home screen. Yeah. Um,                   |
| 15:24      | and I like the fact that it's got, you know, not just calendar in there. It sounds ridiculous.         |
| 15:28      | It's a calendar app, but adding the weather for me made it into, from a good app icon                  |
| 15:34      | or app widget, sorry, into a great app widget. I pestered them about that so much through              |
| 15:38      | the beta. I'm like, just because that just get, that's one less widget I have to deal                  |
| 15:43      | with if I can get today's weather on my calendar. And, uh, I know that was a challenge for them        |
| 15:49      | figuring out where do you put it that doesn't get in the way of calendar data, but I think             |
| 15:53      | they did a good job. And if you use Fantastical, they have, I don't know, they have many             |
| 15:59      | widgets to choose from. So you can choose whatever size you want and how big or how                    |
| 16:05      | much data you want. Uh, which one, do you use the Fantastical widget? Yes. I am currently            |
| 16:11      | experimenting with the medium size in a stack. Um, but I may try the small size later. Uh,             |
| 16:17      | but, uh, at the moment I'm using the medium one. Yeah. I'm using the large one and I'm                 |
| 16:23      | using the version of large one that gives me the monthly calendar and like today's date                |
| 16:28      | and big text. And then my event list underneath, I think I'm probably going to switch back             |
| 16:35      | to the large one. That's just the event list though, because I find I don't really ever                |
| 16:39      | look at the calendar. Like I don't need to know what day is next Thursday very often.                  |
| 16:45      | And I really like having my whole day events on my home screen. So I'm still in the experimental       |
| 16:52      | phase with that, but I, it's just a good job on them. Another one like that that stands                |
| 16:58      | out for me, um, is [[Dark Noise]]. And, um, we, you know, we had [[Dark Noise's\|Dark Noise]] developer on                  |
| 17:04      | the show and both of us are fans of the application. I like, um, cause I have a, I have a tinnitus     |
| 17:10      | issue. I have a lot of ringing in my ears all the time. So I like to have noise playing                |
| 17:14      | almost all the time and [[Dark Noise]] is great for that. And, um, this one, I think kind                 |
| 17:19      | of fits really nicely in the current widget model because you don't really need to interact            |
| 17:25      | with it a lot, but it's got the one I use is the medium one with eight buttons and those               |
| 17:29      | are the eight sounds I use almost always. And honestly, I could probably even go smaller               |
| 17:36      | with that, but the, uh, but you tap on it, it opens the app and starts the noise. And                  |
| 17:42      | I find that really functional. Yes. Um, and I like the fact that you can specify, you                  |
| 17:47      | know, which, which sounds are going to show up in the widget. Um, because that to me is,               |
| 17:51      | you know, the part that makes all these widgets great, the fact that you can save what shows           |
| 17:55      | up in there. Um, and you don't need to worry about the rest of it.                                     |
| 17:58      | Yeah. Something I've done that I think is kind of clever is I have basically what I                    |
| 18:02      | call my, my sound stack and it's a podcast music and [[Dark Noise]] all in one stack. And                  |
| 18:08      | I can just, you know, flip through those to get to any audio I want. And this is much                  |
| 18:13      | more convenient than going and digging for apps.                                                       |
| 18:16      | Yes. Yeah. That's the thing. Like I, I pretty much, if I'm looking for an app, I open the              |
| 18:20      | app library now. Um, but most of the time I don't need to, because either I've hooked                  |
| 18:24      | it to the double back tap on my phone, opens Drafts. Um, and it's straight to a new draft              |
| 18:29      | so that I can, you know, start capturing immediately or it's a widget on my home screen.               |
| 18:34      | All right. Um, one, another one. And I, I promise we're going to get to the nerdy or,                  |
| 18:40      | you know, build your own widgets in a minute, but there's a couple I just want to call out.            |
| 18:44      | And one is it's an Apple widget, but I have not seen anybody write about it or talk about              |
| 18:50      | it, but it's the files app. And this one is very useful. Just gives me the eight documents             |
| 18:57      | I've used most recently in files. And since I use files to store a lot of my work documents,           |
| 19:02      | this makes it super convenient for me to get to those on iPad or iPhone. And I feel like               |
| 19:08      | it's not, you know, there wasn't any rocket science involved here. It's a little icon,                 |
| 19:11      | a little picture and a name of your most recent documents. I think that's probably the best            |
| 19:15      | way to do it. But this is the one where I look at it and I say, man, this would look                   |
| 19:19      | so great on an iPad home screen.                                                                       |
| 19:22      | Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. I can also see another version of this, which is                   |
| 19:27      | just like, um, icon previews, um, of like square previews of different documents. Like                 |
| 19:34      | you would see like, if you open the pages app and you look there, it, um, at how it used               |
| 19:39      | to be at any rate. Um, and now like the thumbnail view, that's what I'm thinking, just thumbnails      |
| 19:43      | with like little text beneath them, because you can do that. Um, you know, different app               |
| 19:47      | developers have done different things, um, and to, to show different stuff. And I think                |
| 19:52      | a thumbnail version of that would also be pretty cool because most of the time I can                   |
| 19:55      | tell what a document is just by looking at the preview. It would be nice to have both.                 |
| 19:59      | Yeah. I want to see that on the iPad.                                                                  |
| 20:02      | Food and alms is another one. Uh, I've been tracking food and I've, I've just been increasingly        |
| 20:07      | unhappy with the usual food tracking apps as they've got more monetised and more kind                  |
| 20:14      | of just, you know, weird, the way you open the app and they want to sell you a monthly                 |
| 20:18      | plan and they want to tell you about some partner service that will help you. And it's                 |
| 20:23      | just like, I just want to track my food, you know, it's not that hard.                                 |
| 20:26      | And this one sinks my iCloud, right?                                                                   |
| 20:28      | Yeah, it does. And, and it doesn't have the database that some of the others do. That's                |
| 20:32      | my only kind of negative on it. Once in a while, I found I have to add food to the database.           |
| 20:36      | But the fact is I don't eat that many different kinds of food. So very quickly it kind of              |
| 20:40      | got what I needed. And it just got this super clean widget and like there's a couple different         |
| 20:48      | ones. One can give you stats, but the one I like is the one that predicts what you're                  |
| 20:53      | going to eat next because quite often I eat the same thing and they do just do a good                  |
| 20:57      | job with it. I mean, it's, I'm using that widget more than I thought I would. In fact,                 |
| 21:02      | I just this morning took food and alms off my dock because I find all I do is go to the                |
| 21:06      | widget anymore.                                                                                        |
| 21:07      | That's great. Yeah. I mean, I think that's, that's, you know, a sign of a really great                 |
| 21:12      | widget where you're like, I don't need the app icon anymore because I just, you know,                  |
| 21:16      | the widget does what I needed to do. And I found their smart suggestions are pretty good               |
| 21:20      | too. I need to figure out some kind of pantry fridge inventory. So it's like, oh, and by               |
| 21:25      | the way, you are eating this for lunch because otherwise it's going to expire and you don't            |
| 21:28      | want to throw food away. And therefore this is going to be your suggested food. But I'll               |
| 21:33      | get there at some point. Another one that I've been using, and I know you've been using                |
| 21:37      | as well, David, at the Timery widget. Unfortunately, it's lost a little bit of its interactivity       |
| 21:42      | that it had before with, you know, iOS 12, because iOS 13 pretty much takes out interactivity          |
| 21:50      | unless you're shortcuts. So, you know, at least the shortcuts team got that. But it                    |
| 21:55      | has some, some pretty, you know, it works pretty well for me. It's got the stuff on                    |
| 21:59      | there that I need.                                                                                     |
| 22:00      | Yeah. And the way I use this one is actually I have two instances of the widget right next             |
| 22:06      | to each other on my, what used to be called today screen, but they're the two small ones.              |
| 22:12      | And one of them is just a big button that shows the currently running timer. And the                   |
| 22:15      | second one is the one that shows the day's accumulation. And this has been a big day                   |
| 22:22      | for me for podcasts. I did a bunch of post production on Mac power users and I did prep                |
| 22:26      | for today's show. So we're just getting started recording. I can tell you, I already have              |
| 22:30      | two hours and 38 minutes into podcasts today. So, you know, but that's, that's the kind                |
| 22:36      | of data I kind of like, you know, 24 minutes of family time, 19 minutes of health, I need              |
| 22:42      | to work out after we finish. But the, yeah, it's, once again, it's a, it's an app that                 |
| 22:49      | would be better if you could interact with it more in the widget form, but the developer               |
| 22:54      | did a great job with what he had.                                                                      |
| 22:56      | And I think we might see interactivity come back with iOS 14. I'm hoping we do a little                |
| 23:01      | bit more. Like they don't need to like go all out and let you do everything. But, you                  |
| 23:06      | know, for a timer to be able to show, you know, like, oh, and this timer is currently                  |
| 23:10      | active, like it did before, that would be a great, you know, thing to get back.                        |
| 23:15      | Or even just being able to turn off the timer without jumping into the app or task list                |
| 23:20      | applications. Like OmniFocus has one in beta right now that I think is pretty good, but                |
| 23:26      | you can't check items off in the widget because they don't let them.                                   |
| 23:30      | Unfortunately.                                                                                         |
| 23:31      | David, we keep fascinating back between iOS 13 and 14. I've just double checked. We are                |
| 23:36      | on iOS 14 right now. You threw me earlier by saying iOS 13.                                            |
| 23:40      | Yeah, myself as well.                                                                                  |
| 23:41      | And then I thought that I was in the wrong and oh gosh, iOS has been around for a really               |
| 23:44      | long time. Well done iOS. You know, happy teenage years.                                               |
| 23:47      | Listen to the pro users.                                                                               |
| 23:48      | It's at the point where it confuses me.                                                                |
| 23:49      | They don't know a version of iOS they're on.                                                           |
| 23:52      | I know which version of, you know, that I'm running, which is the latest developer beta.               |
| 23:56      | So it's 0.2, beta 3, but don't ask me what the big number is because that's not so important           |
| 24:01      | right now.                                                                                             |
| 24:02      | Well, I've just been spending a lot of time working in betas and it honestly does get                  |
| 24:07      | you confused when you're, you know, either way.                                                        |
| 24:11      | So when we get to iOS 15, I think we'll probably see the interactivity show up, but I don't            |
| 24:18      | want to wait for iOS 15 to get to the iPad. I would really like the iPad to get fixed                  |
| 24:24      | in iOS 14.2, 0.3, whatever.                                                                            |
| 24:26      | Yeah, that would be great if it could be.                                                              |
| 24:30      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Sync Up, a OneDrive podcast. I love finding             |
| 24:35      | new podcasts to listen to. It's always great finding that intersection of fabulous content             |
| 24:39      | and some wonderful hosts who really can tell you everything.                                           |
| 24:42      | If you're looking for a new shit to listen to, Sync Up takes you behind the scenes of                   |
| 24:46      | OneDrive so you can learn about how to connect files, share your documents, and work from              |
| 24:51      | anywhere. And you'll get to hear about the design and development side of things too.                  |
| 24:56      | Each show covers a dedicated topic, guest interviews, news and announcements, plus a                   |
| 25:00      | special topic outside of the technology norm. And just so you've got an idea of what to                |
| 25:04      | expect, I want to tell you about some of the topics you might be interested in that were               |
| 25:08      | on previous episodes.                                                                                  |
| 25:09      | They've talked about empowering Mac users, changing management and product adoption,                   |
| 25:14      | success, file sharing, personal vaults, and more. I recently listened to their episode                 |
| 25:19      | on mobile productivity on Android. I'm always willing to look at new things, and most of               |
| 25:24      | my colleagues at work use Android, so it's no surprise I learned plenty of tips and tricks             |
| 25:28      | and was able to help some of my colleagues figure some things out too, as well as learning             |
| 25:33      | a few things myself.                                                                                   |
| 25:35      | Go and listen to it now. Just search for Sync Up wherever you get your podcasts. That's S-Y-N-C-U-P,    |

| 25:50      | So David, we've been teasing people a lot. Let's get nerdy with our widgets because we've              |
| 25:56      | talked about some of the stuff that you can do just by installing the app. And there are               |
| 26:01      | some other apps, actually, that you can use and you just install them and you do everything            |
| 26:07      | in that app. So there's a whole series of different kinds of nerd levels here. So I                    |
| 26:12      | would suggest that we start at the easier level. So this is the sort of thing that you                 |
| 26:16      | can recommend to friends and family if they're like, oh, I want to customise my home screen.           |
| 26:21      | The first one that I found a while ago, colour widgets. And this lets you put like the time,            |
| 26:27      | the date, weather, and stuff like that. But you can change the colour as implied by the                 |
| 26:33      | name, but the font and positioning and stuff like that from your, from inside of the app.              |
| 26:39      | And it's pretty cool.                                                                                  |
| 26:40      | Yeah. I mean, for the basics, it's, you know, it gives you everything you need. You can                |
| 26:45      | build your own widgets and you have a lot of design control. And I think that's something              |
| 26:50      | a lot of people are looking for. You and I, because we're nerds, look at these widgets                 |
| 26:55      | like how, you know, how nerdy of data can I get you? Like one of the widgets you're                    |
| 27:01      | going to talk about later shows you your podcast schedule for the next week. You know, that's          |
| 27:05      | the kind of nerdy stuff that gets us excited. But a lot of people, they just want it to                |
| 27:10      | show the current day and date in a font that is appealing to them. And that is the ideal               |
| 27:18      | customer colour widgets.                                                                                |
| 27:20      | Yes. And it's great. I did notice that quite a few of these widgets can show you the current           |
| 27:25      | time, but there's a small problem with this, because widgets don't update every like 50                |
| 27:31      | seconds, a 30 seconds, sorry, or something like that. Then they often show you the wrong               |
| 27:35      | time and they can be out by several minutes because they update, I think it's approximately            |
| 27:40      | every 15 minutes, but it depends on how often the app tells them they need to update. So               |
| 27:46      | I found putting the time on my home screen is a bad idea because if I look in the top                  |
| 27:51      | left, A, I already have the time, admittedly is very small, but B, it will be different                |
| 27:56      | almost certainly unless the app was literally, unless the widget was literally just added              |
| 27:59      | to my home screen, it usually floats off and drifts back and everything.                               |
| 28:04      | No, I totally agree. Like there's a reason Fantastic Hell's widget doesn't give you an                 |
| 28:09      | option to put the time on because it's not going to be the same time as the actual time.               |
| 28:17      | So it's so much so that some of the developers have resorted to like fuzzy time and different          |
| 28:23      | ways to do it that is less precise because they can't do it. And this gets back to that                |
| 28:30      | whole lack of interactivity. And I guess kind of a sub issue is that these widgets, the                |
| 28:36      | Apple doesn't want these widgets killing your battery. So they use very little power. The              |
| 28:40      | screen gets updated and that's basically it until the next scheduled update, which is                  |
| 28:46      | not every 30 seconds. I don't know. I haven't looked into the API. I don't know what's the             |
| 28:51      | most frequent and app can update its widget.                                                           |
| 28:54      | I think this varies depending on like the battery level in your phone and whether or                   |
| 28:58      | not you're in low power mode and a lot of other things. I think I've seen people talking               |
| 29:03      | about every 15 minutes being the most frequent, but at the same time, it's one of those things         |
| 29:08      | where all a developer can do is ask to be updated and put themselves in a queue and                    |
| 29:14      | iOS will go, yep, or nope. And there's nothing that the developer themselves can actually              |
| 29:20      | do about that other than suggest you reboot your phone, which if you ever have an issue                |
| 29:28      | with a widget where it just shows as like a gray block or something, then rebooting your               |
| 29:33      | phone fixes it as far as I can tell. So that's kind of handy to know.                                  |
| 29:37      | Yeah, but it is really, you know, it's very limited is the point. So any of these widgets              |
| 29:44      | that promise to give you up to date, you know, stock, stock widgets that are going to tell             |
| 29:49      | you up to date information about the stock value, those aren't necessarily reliable.                   |
| 29:54      | So just have that in mind.                                                                             |
| 29:57      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                            |
| 29:58      | Colour widgets is a great app. And I think it's a nice introductory to this, but there's                |
| 30:04      | an app that goes a little further with Widgetsmith. And Widgetsmith is kind of like the original       |
| 30:09      | build your own widget widget app.                                                                      |
| 30:12      | Yes. This is from David underscore Smith. And he also has an app called Watch Smith,                   |
| 30:19      | which some people may be thinking that they've heard of. And Widgetsmith is the widget version         |
| 30:24      | of Watch Smith. So you can do you can add, you know, like different views to widgets                   |
| 30:30      | and you can create multiple different widgets for each different size. So I could create               |
| 30:34      | say seven small widgets, 20 medium widgets and three large widgets or whatever I wanted.               |
| 30:39      | But what I really like is you can say that when it refreshes, like with a specific time                |
| 30:44      | period, it should show this kind of widget. But after that time, for example, after I                  |
| 30:49      | would usually finish work, it should show me a different kind of widget. And I love this               |
| 30:55      | and I've been playing with it. And I've actually just given one, like small spot on my home            |
| 30:59      | screen to Widgetsmith and one particular small widget from Widgetsmith. It's not a stack.              |
| 31:04      | It's just one widget and it changes depending on, you know, what time of the day it is.                |
| 31:10      | And I'm really liking it. It, you know, it's great for making sure I've got the right                  |
| 31:13      | information based on approximately when I am in my day.                                                |
| 31:17      | Yeah. So like during the day, you could have it show calendar events. And then when you                |
| 31:21      | get home, you know, after, let's say after 6pm, it's going to show you music or whatever.              |
| 31:29      | And it even can be controlled on weekdays versus weekends. It's just a very interesting                |
| 31:36      | idea of scripting widgets. I don't think anybody else has done this, although you could duplicate      |
| 31:42      | this feature with some of the shortcuts based widgets, but it's just, you know, it's very              |
| 31:47      | unique. And he came up with the idea on the Watchsmith app, you know, because he did the               |
| 31:51      | same thing with watch complications where you could schedule watch complications.                      |
| 31:55      | Yes. And I've said this on MPU and, you know, Dave Smith                                               |
| 31:59      | is a friend and I just, I'm so happy that he had an app that just took off like it did.                |
| 32:04      | But he's also a very smart developer and Widgetsmith seems like it gets an update every time I go      |
| 32:10      | to check my phone for updates. He's just like cranking them out. So the app is evolving very           |
| 32:17      | quickly because of its popularity. And I'm glad to see him keep the gas down on it, but                |
| 32:23      | it seems like there will be features in this app when this show publishes that are not there           |
| 32:28      | right now because I mean, like I'm in the beta for the 1.1. I mean, he's already upping                |
| 32:34      | the version because he's adding so much.                                                               |
| 32:37      | Yes. Yeah. Same. And the other thing is, you know, there's just so much that people can                |
| 32:43      | do. This is an app that literally went viral on TikTok. David, I can't believe I've just               |
| 32:47      | said those words on automators. This went viral on TikTok because it's a great way to                  |
| 32:52      | customise the widgets on your phone. And it can show you different data and I'm loving                 |
| 32:57      | time zones. Time zones are great. I can always check what time it is, whether you are.                 |
| 33:01      | Yeah. That's nice. And I totally think this is one that you could give a permanent slot                |
| 33:08      | and have it change its content by the course of the day. We haven't really talked about                |
| 33:13      | that. What do you think of the smart stacks versus the manual stack? So you can have the               |
| 33:19      | phone just choose for you when to put data up or you can turn off the smart stack button               |
| 33:26      | and then you have to manually kind of flip between them.                                               |
| 33:29      | Well, I found serious suggestions, specifically the app suggestions, to be pretty much spot            |
| 33:35      | on for me. But unfortunately, I have not found the smart stack to be particularly smart.               |
| 33:41      | It usually has information, which is not what I'm looking for. And more importantly, it                |
| 33:46      | doesn't appear to me that I can actually add what I'm looking for to that stack. So I can't            |
| 33:54      | put a bunch of different apps in there. So I have to create my own stacks so I can scroll              |
| 33:58      | through them. And I would much rather do that because then I can just swipe and there we               |
| 34:02      | go. I'm on, you know, the next stack that the next part of the stack that I need. So                   |
| 34:06      | I'm pretty happy with dumb stacks myself. How about you?                                               |
| 34:10      | I have had the exact same experience. It just seems like when I leave the smart stacks on              |
| 34:16      | and if I just have like a stack with two, like on my, my big widget on my home screen,                 |
| 34:22      | I have now added OmniFocus to it. But for the longest time, it was just photos and calendar            |
| 34:27      | or fantastical. And it just seemed like every time I looked at it, it gave me the exact opposite       |
| 34:31      | of what I wanted to see. And, and I'm not sure this is the computer's fault because                    |
| 34:36      | I don't think there's really any reliable way to determine when I want to see a calendar               |
| 34:40      | versus when I want to see a nice picture. So I turned off all the smart stack. I don't                 |
| 34:45      | think I have it. In fact, I know I don't have it running on any of my stacks. And, you know,           |
| 34:50      | maybe that'll get better in the future, but I feel like that's just not quite right yet.               |
| 34:54      | Yeah. Yeah. Definitely need some tweaking there, at least for, for you and me. But that's              |
| 35:00      | okay because there's plenty of other widgets that we can add into our stacks to make them              |
| 35:05      | a bit smarter ourselves. And one that I found out today, I tweeted about, you know, getting            |
| 35:11      | nerdy with widgets this morning, and several people had plenty of recommendations for me.              |
| 35:16      | And one of them was Widgeridoo, which for starters, best app name ever, David. Absolutely. Lovely        |
| 35:22      | name, Widgeridoo. So the developer tweeted out, tweeted to me and said, Hey, that he had this            |
| 35:28      | app, you know, and you can, that I should give it a go. And he was right. You absolutely               |
| 35:33      | should give this a go because this allows you to make a widget. But it's a kind of a                   |
| 35:39      | step beyond what you could do with, say, Widgetsmith or something. The idea is that you have a         |
| 35:44      | grid and you put different blocks in that grid to, you know, make the widget that you                  |
| 35:49      | want. And you can set colour backgrounds for each block in the widget and gradients on                  |
| 35:54      | them as well if you wanted to. And I'm really liking this as just an easy way to build widgets.        |
| 36:01      | This is something that I could see myself saying to my mom, like, if she's there, you                  |
| 36:05      | know, wanting like a custom widget, it could be like install Widgeridoo, you know, that that's           |
| 36:09      | going to do what you want, where you can get the different pieces of information that you              |
| 36:12      | want in the, in the format that you want. But it's not so complex that you need to like                |
| 36:17      | go and program a shortcut or write a JavaScript script to make it happen and to update it.             |
| 36:22      | You can just put the stuff in and it does it.                                                          |
| 36:25      | Yeah, I downloaded the app on your recommendation and I bought it. I bought the upgrade. I think       |
| 36:30      | it was like four bucks and you unlock everything. And this is very much, you know, kind of the         |
| 36:36      | simplified Lego for widgets where you can build, you can pick the size of widget you                   |
| 36:42      | want and then they've got a bunch of different components you can choose from. And the components      |
| 36:48      | are interesting, like there's a countdown timer. So let's say you want to count down                   |
| 36:53      | to a holiday or vacation, you can make that a component of your widget. The birthday widget            |
| 36:59      | I thought was really done well as well, where you could have on the medium size, you can               |
| 37:03      | show the person's name and their birthday or you could just have a picture of the person's             |
| 37:07      | show up in a very tiny version where you could have, you know, upcoming birthdays and just             |
| 37:12      | lots of stuff for which people are releasing application specifics, you know, there are                |
| 37:19      | apps out there to give you a widget with birthdays on it, but this just makes that one component       |
| 37:24      | of many others. So it just kind of combines everything into one place. And anybody could               |
| 37:31      | do this. It's just not that hard.                                                                      |
| 37:33      | Yeah, exactly. And I find that it I found that it was really simple to put a couple                    |
| 37:38      | of different widgets together. And it's got access to things like battery usage and stuff              |
| 37:42      | like that as well. So it was, you know, you can, you can have a cute picture of your dog               |
| 37:46      | or you can have the battery or you could have both. And it works really nicely. So I'm                 |
| 37:52      | pretty happy with that. It's also got toggles for things like invert colours and dark mode              |
| 37:56      | and things like that, which is a nice bonus.                                                           |
| 37:59      | Yeah. In fact, and that would be something I would complain about, about some of the more              |
| 38:02      | automation deep apps we're going to talk about is they're really not very conversant with              |
| 38:07      | light mode versus dark mode. They give you a lot of control over what the widget looks like. But,      |
| 38:13      | but, you know, if you build it out as kind of like a dark mode looking widget and your                 |
| 38:18      | phone is in light mode, it stands out as looking funny, whereas this app actually tries to solve       |
| 38:23      | that problem. And overall, the design is very attractive. I mean, it looks it's got kind of            |
| 38:29      | an opinion. And if you go look at the app on the app store, you'll see it. But, you know,              |
| 38:34      | it gives you control over it, but it also makes it easy to make something that looks nice.             |
| 38:39      | And some of these apps to build widgets don't make it that easy.                                       |
| 38:43      | Yeah. Yeah. We're going to get to some of the more complex ones later where you build your own         |
| 38:48      | widget. But that also means that you potentially need to figure out things like padding and,           |
| 38:54      | you know, positioning and stuff like that. Instead of a, I am going to drag this item                  |
| 39:00      | into this block or just tap on this block and I select this item and that's it. I'm done. Now I        |
| 39:04      | can choose my colour. Yes, toggle the gradient on or off. And that's it. I'm done. So, yeah,            |
| 39:10      | there's upsides and downsides to both. I really like playing with things and                           |
| 39:14      | some of the more complicated ones have had me fascinated all day. I've spent half of my day,           |
| 39:19      | David, programming widgets with shortcuts and scripts. Yeah. Well, I can see why. And it's             |
| 39:25      | fun because when you have that kind of control, then you can really make something neat. Like,         |
| 39:29      | for instance, I've been teasing throughout the episode Rose made one that looks at your calendar       |
| 39:34      | for the next, I think seven days. And if there's any podcast scheduled, it gives you a list of         |
| 39:39      | those over the next seven days. That is not something you could do with which we do because            |
| 39:44      | it, it'll give you a calendar and it'll leave in with their latest update, let you pick a specific     |
| 39:49      | calendar, but it will not say give me every event on this calendar over the next seven days. At least  |
| 39:54      | I couldn't figure out a way to do it. I think it's also, I've got multiple calendars for podcasting    |
| 40:00      | and I've actually made three, three widgets, which are almost the same, but they're not actually the   |
| 40:04      | same because they're all calendar based, but you know, I've got podcasting, I've got deadlines,        |
| 40:09      | and I've got my, my, my time plan for my day, which is based on my time blocking calendar              |
| 40:13      | and a couple of others. So yeah, but I mean, they don't like look into the future so much,             |
| 40:19      | it'll have today's calendar and tomorrow's calendar, but it won't have all the events in               |
| 40:24      | this calendar over the next week. But who knows, by the time this show publishes,                      |
| 40:28      | it may do that because that's the world we live in with these widgets. These developers are going      |
| 40:32      | crazy and just, you know, hitting updates daily on apps like would you redo a similar one,             |
| 40:40      | but more nerdy, I think would be usage. And that is an app that does nothing, but just kind of give    |
| 40:47      | you data on your phone, battery level data usage, just all the kind of like, if you want to nerd out   |
| 40:53      | and have a widget that just tells you, you know, what you're doing with your phone or whether,         |
| 40:58      | you know, where a bunch of, you know, usage statistics are on your phone. That's what this             |
| 41:04      | one does. There's not that much more to say about it than that's the focus of it, but it looks nice.   |
| 41:09      | It's got a good design. I've been using it just, just to kind of track battery and things on my        |
| 41:15      | phone. And I put it over in the today view screen, I don't look at it often, but it's nice knowing     |
| 41:20      | I can just swipe over and have that stuff if I want it. Yes. And that's the thing with all of          |
| 41:25      | these, you know, you can, you can play with them and see, you know, what, what do you actually use     |
| 41:31      | and what do you not use? And what should you maybe, you know, like move off of your home screen into   |
| 41:36      | the today view, which yes, I am still using and by the sounds of it, David, you are as well.           |
| 41:41      | Oh yeah, big time, big time. Okay. Another one that is of interest to me is launcher five.             |
| 41:49      | Launcher was kind of the original customised your widget app on the iPhone. We've talked about it on   |
| 41:57      | automators several times back before these new widgets existed with iOS 14. And of course,             |
| 42:04      | they made the transition to iOS 14. Are you using launcher at this point?                              |
| 42:09      | I was using launcher for a little while. And then one of the primary use cases that I had for it,      |
| 42:15      | which was messaging people through WhatsApp, they decided to get an iPhone. So I can use iMessage      |
| 42:20      | now. And so I'm not using that as much because I have the pinned people in messages, which is much     |
| 42:25      | more convenient. But I have been playing with it quite a bit. And I like the fact that you can,        |
| 42:31      | you know, specify pretty much anything to be behind any icon and so on. And so I'm probably            |
| 42:37      | going to put my playlist one back up there because I had several different playlists. But              |
| 42:42      | unfortunately, on the iPhone, you cannot customise play to all of my speakers. And I have a speaker    |
| 42:48      | in almost every room right now, David. So I would really like to be able to say, hey, play this        |
| 42:53      | everywhere. I can't do that on iPhone. And that's a iOS limitation, not anything to do with launcher   |
| 42:58      | specifically. Yeah, but launcher is interesting because for an automator, because it gives you         |
| 43:04      | the power at the back end, you know, you don't have a lot of control over how the widget looks.        |
| 43:09      | But when you press the button, the app has a lot of power behind it of things it can do, you know.     |
| 43:14      | So it's, it's just, you have to take a look at it. And we've talked about launcher on the show         |
| 43:19      | before. So go check it out. But it is now part of the iOS 14 widget ecosystem. So that's good.         |
| 43:28      | Yes, yes, it's not only good, it's great because there is so much that we can do with this.            |
| 43:33      | David, are you ready to get even nerdier? Yes, I think we need to go a level deeper, Rose.             |
| 43:38      | Okay, because I think I'm going to start on a simpler one. And I'm using air quotes here because       |
| 43:45      | all of these can be as complicated as you like. But Charty definitely deserves a shout out here       |
| 43:52      | because you can turn charts into widgets, which means you can display any data as a chart,             |
| 43:58      | or you can display any data as data, because Rodrigo, who was on the show before,                      |
| 44:04      | realised that people want to display things and they want things to be pretty on their phones.         |
| 44:09      | And so now you can also create another kind of chart. And they have, I've forgotten what it's          |
| 44:17      | called, I think it's like data display or something like that. But they, there are so many             |
| 44:23      | different kinds of data that you can display here that it's really great because it turns out          |
| 44:30      | people are great at displaying data and making it pretty. And who doesn't love pretty data?            |
| 44:35      | Yeah. And the thing, the real payoff is that this combines with shortcuts, right?                      |
| 44:42      | Yes. And that's what Charty always has been. It has been an ability to take your shortcut data        |
| 44:48      | and turn it into something that looks nice. But now it looks nice, right?                              |
| 44:51      | It looks nice. But now it looks nice on your home screen. And, you know, like the stuff we were        |
| 44:57      | talking about earlier, like a countdown timer, you could using Charty build a shortcut to do          |
| 45:03      | also a countdown timer and turn that into a chart widget on your home screen. And you would have       |
| 45:09      | absolute control over exactly how that looked. That's a very simple example. I mean, but we            |
| 45:14      | talked about Charty tracking OmniFocus tests that you completed versus didn't complete, you know.     |
| 45:20      | I mean, you could have any kind of data that is accessible via shortcuts become a shortcut widget      |
| 45:28      | on your or just a widget on your home screen. Like this is one for me that like, you know,             |
| 45:34      | I'm sorry to keep banging this drum. But if I had that whole iPad screen, can you imagine the          |
| 45:39      | charts? Like I could have a status board for my day right across the top of my iPad. I mean, it's      |
| 45:45      | just it's harder to do this on the iPhone because there's just not enough pixels. But, but man,        |
| 45:52      | Charty has a lot of potential. Yes, yes, it does. And the other thing is, is because a lot of         |
| 45:58      | people have already been playing with this stuff and creating charts, you know, to show in other       |
| 46:04      | areas, you know, within shortcuts, or maybe, you know, a report for their boss, so that they can       |
| 46:08      | say, Hey, yeah, I really did work 70 hours this week. Here's the chart to prove it. You know,          |
| 46:13      | now you can take that and display it on your home screen and maybe inverse it so that you can          |
| 46:18      | see how much free time you had instead. But it's it's really great to see, you know, the apps that     |
| 46:23      | already existed, you know, Launcher 5 and Charty, you know, two examples of this, you know, expanding |
| 46:31      | to really, you know, go all out on the widgets. Yeah, it's now up to 22 different actions for          |
| 46:37      | shortcuts with Charty and five different widget styles. I mean, it's just, first of all, can I        |
| 46:44      | just say, I love that this guy had this crazy nerdy idea, and there's enough people out there that     |
| 46:50      | are interested in stuff like this that he could turn it into a business. I mean, that's amazing.       |
| 46:54      | But, but yeah, you're going to hear more about Charty and widgets, I think, going forward on          |
| 47:00      | the Automators podcast, because it just digs in so deep. And Charty, I think, kind of also works      |
| 47:06      | hand in hand with the next app. And the next widget pack is one that we could legitimately             |
| 47:12      | give an entire show to. Oh, yeah. And so I've been doing some playing this morning, specifically,      |
| 47:19      | I've been playing with this for quite some time, because widget pack is a very basic app on its        |
| 47:26      | own, in that it just runs a shortcut, and then uses that to figure out what the widget is,             |
| 47:33      | and then displays it, which means that in order to update it, you have to run a shortcut. So I         |
| 47:38      | now have a shortcut called widget updates, which I just run on a regular basis. I have it run,         |
| 47:44      | I think, every time I close Drafts, and at the moment is running once an hour. And these widgets       |
| 47:48      | don't sync between your devices, but you can create a widget on, say, one device and then              |
| 47:54      | run it on another, and it will just create the widget and update it as well. But it won't update       |
| 47:59      | something on another device. But what I like about this is everything is inside of shortcuts.          |
| 48:05      | So you create horizontal stacks and vertical stacks. Horizontal stacks are things going across         |
| 48:10      | your widget, vertical stacks are things going from top to bottom of your widget. And there's           |
| 48:14      | also a Z stack where you can then have layers. So you have a background, and then you have a text,     |
| 48:19      | and maybe something on top of that. And this is great because Scotty Jackson, who we've had on         |
| 48:28      | the show before, created custom OmniFocus widgets with widget pack. And I've got a link to his         |
| 48:33      | blog post on that. And then there's a forum thread, which has got a whole bunch of other               |
| 48:37      | things in there as well. But he created that. Now, OmniFocus has got widgets in beta right now.        |
| 48:42      | But this is custom widgets, displaying the data that he wants in the way that he wants it to be        |
| 48:48      | displayed. And that, for me, is the key. And I was looking at that. And this morning, I went,          |
| 48:54      | you know what I really like on my home screen, my podcasting schedule, and deadlines that I've         |
| 48:59      | got coming up. And also, I'd actually quite like a plan for my current day, you know, what have        |
| 49:05      | I blocked out time wise for my day. And so I created three shortcuts, which are almost identical       |
| 49:12      | to each other. I've got podcasting deadlines, and my daily plan is what it's called. And I use an SF   |
| 49:18      | symbol to start with. And then I create the title. And that is in a horizontal stack. And I set a      |
| 49:24      | colour of that. And then I pull in calendar events. And I go through each one. And I format the date    |
| 49:29      | to be a specific date. And then I put something else after it. And each event becomes a horizontal     |
| 49:35      | stack. And then I put all of my horizontal stacks into a vertical stack. And that's my widget.         |
| 49:40      | Now, it sounds kind of complex, but I'm going to have links in show notes to how I did both my         |
| 49:44      | podcasting widget and also my deadlines widget. Because this is a, it sounds complicated. And          |
| 49:54      | some of the shortcuts that I've taken apart from people using widget pack are most definitely          |
| 49:58      | complicated. But it can also be done quite simply. And I think the deadlines one in particular is      |
| 50:05      | quite a simple shortcut. And people will be able to figure that out from there.                        |
| 50:09      | Yeah, it really isn't that hard. And yeah, like the power roses shortcut gives you, this is the        |
| 50:16      | one I was talking about earlier, is that it shows you podcasts scheduled over the next week,           |
| 50:23      | where I was unable to do that with any of the other like kind of built in calendar tools,              |
| 50:28      | because only in shortcuts, can you say, look at the next seven days or look at the next 14 days        |
| 50:33      | and give me every event in this calendar list, or you could even get more specific, like if you        |
| 50:39      | just wanted recording, and if you named your events recording automators, you could say it has to be   |
| 50:46      | in one of these three calendars and have the word recording in the name. So with shortcuts,            |
| 50:50      | you've got this massive power to, you know, to filter and, you know, stretch out or to limit           |
| 50:57      | your search. And then what you get with this app with, you know, I forget the name already,            |
| 51:05      | it's a widget pack. With widget pack is then you can say, okay, now take all that data that I've       |
| 51:10      | just found through these fancy filters and display as data. And it's not ugly. I mean,                 |
| 51:16      | Rose just kind of breeze by the fact that she's using [[SF Symbols]], but that's Apple has made            |
| 51:22      | its own basically icon set for developers that normal people can use. And she's hitting that in        |
| 51:29      | shortcuts to make a really attractive widget that shows her stuff happening over next week.            |
| 51:35      | Not everybody listening has a podcast schedule, but maybe you've got a team meeting schedule or        |
| 51:40      | some other thing that you'd like to see out a week in advance. You can just download this widget.      |
| 51:46      | You know, knowing your kids school plan, things like that, you know, my parents, it sounds really      |
| 51:51      | silly. My dad has a calendar which tells him which bin needs to go out which week, because here in     |
| 51:56      | the UK, the recycling bin is picked up on one day. And then the next week, it's not the recycling bin, |
| 52:01      | it's the regular bin. And then every third week, there's glass as well, but it doesn't matter          |
| 52:05      | what other bins going out. So my dad has a calendar for that, which he shares with my mom.             |
| 52:09      | I have, I'm making one of these custom widgets so it can be on their screen. So it'll show them,       |
| 52:14      | hey, don't forget to put out these bins this week. And, you know, it sounds really silly. And the      |
| 52:20      | other Alexa skills and stuff for this, but at the same time, just being able to put custom data        |
| 52:26      | that you want on the home screen of your phone is pretty cool. And I have to say, I really like        |
| 52:32      | the fact that widget pack includes [[SF Symbols]]. There's also another app which I'm going to put         |
| 52:37      | a link to in the show notes, because [[SF Symbols]], San Francisco symbols, is a really nice way of        |
| 52:43      | showing, you know, an icon to represent something. And there, there's a great app that you can use     |
| 52:51      | on your iPhone to, to see, you know, all the different symbols. There's also an app from               |
| 52:56      | Apple on your Mac, which you can download and look at for free. But I'm using this iPhone one,         |
| 53:03      | which I've linked in the show notes now. I've gone all in with [[SF Symbols]]. If you've seen              |
| 53:08      | any of the presentations I've done lately, I use them as my icons and the paper was field guide,       |
| 53:13      | which will get released after Big Sur. The [[SF Symbols]] show up throughout the, those,                   |
| 53:18      | those keynote presentations. So it's just, it's just a great way to, to easily demonstrate data.       |
| 53:24      | But the nice thing, you know, the point here is you're accessing it from inside shortcuts. And         |
| 53:29      | all of the time we spent talking about shortcuts on this show over the last several years, and,        |
| 53:34      | you know, my shortcuts field guide, Rosa's shortcuts book, it all kind of leads to this,               |
| 53:39      | to a point where you say, now, okay, I'm getting good at shortcuts and I'm getting data one out        |
| 53:43      | of shortcuts. Now I'm just going to have that available to me on my home screen at a glance,           |
| 53:48      | where I don't have to do anything. I don't have to run a shortcut. It's just there for me. And         |
| 53:53      | that, you know, that's the payoff. Interestingly, one of widget packs actions is update widget,        |
| 53:59      | you know, because of this problem that we, you know, it just doesn't update as often as we'd like.     |
| 54:05      | But they've even tried to solve that with this app. Well, update widget specifically                   |
| 54:10      | saves your, your current widget data into widget pack so that then widget pack can display it.         |
| 54:16      | And Charty has another one as well, which is also called update widget. And yes,                      |
| 54:21      | if you're using Charty, you need to use the Charty action. If you're using widget pack,              |
| 54:24      | you need to use the widget pack action where, and it basically tells these apps, okay,                 |
| 54:29      | hey, this is, you know, the current state of what should be in your widget. So the next time           |
| 54:33      | the iOS says, have you got a widget update for me? They can go, yes, yes, I do. Here is the            |
| 54:37      | current data, please, please, please, please, displayed. At which point iOS will go, yep, or           |
| 54:42      | nope. But, you know, they, they then have it so they can do that. But like the thing you're doing      |
| 54:48      | with it, saying show me my podcast over the next week, that is something that makes sense for a        |
| 54:53      | widget because it's not going to change frequently. And largely the data is going to be accurate.      |
| 54:59      | Yes. Looking at your, your widget, I haven't had time to dig in on it. Something I'd like to do        |
| 55:04      | is when I tap on it, have it open up the calendar in Fantastic Health. I don't know if I can do        |
| 55:10      | that or not. That's, that's something I've not done yet. But if you look, so I linked to Scotty's      |
| 55:17      | OmniFocus widgets as well in the show notes. He has the URL section in there in, in his actions,       |
| 55:26      | so that when you tap on one of those actions, what the tasks in OmniFocus, it will take you to that.   |
| 55:31      | And I've yet to do that with mine. But you can do that so that it will open up the calendar,           |
| 55:37      | or you could even have it open to specific events or things like that. At the moment,                  |
| 55:42      | I'm fine with it pretty much just displaying. And I have a mostly black background on my iPhone,       |
| 55:46      | which is why the backgrounds of these widgets are indeed black. But that works quite well,             |
| 55:50      | because it just blends in and I just see deadlines or podcasting or my daily plan.                     |
| 55:55      | Yeah. Well, Scotty's is, is amazing. It's like a work of art because.                                  |
| 55:59      | Yeah, it's very pretty.                                                                                |
| 56:01      | And like you said, he's using the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]. So if you tap on a task on the list,                     |
| 56:07      | it takes you to the individual task in OmniFocus. Well, at the point we're recording this,             |
| 56:13      | I'm on the OmniFocus beta. The OmniFocus list doesn't do that. You know, I mean,                       |
| 56:18      | but the OmniFocus one presents the data a little denser, which I think I prefer,                       |
| 56:23      | but I'm not sure. But, you know, I could do that too if I altered Scotty's script to put him closer    |
| 56:28      | together. It's just, it's really quite impressive what he's done with this. And it really gives me     |
| 56:35      | hope that any app that is addressable through shortcuts could become, you could make a widget          |
| 56:41      | exactly how you want it with this. I do wish, however, that there was a taught a way to follow         |
| 56:48      | the system like light mode, dark mode. Like I don't see that with. So you can do that. Okay.           |
| 56:54      | That is something you can do, but it's not the most logical things to do. So what you need to do       |
| 56:59      | inside of shortcuts with widget pack, I'm just creating a new shortcut. So I can just double           |
| 57:04      | check all of the actions. And of course, the app screen on iOS 14.2 beta three is blank. There we      |
| 57:11      | go. So you can set the colour. And you can say primary. And there's also secondary. So when you         |
| 57:19      | set the colour, and there's also an accent colour, when you set a colour, and it uses primary,            |
| 57:25      | this changes depending on whether or not your device is in a light mode or dark mode.                  |
| 57:30      | And that means that it will then change things. So primary, I believe is white. And then if you        |
| 57:37      | invert it, you get the opposite of it. And there is an invert colour action in widget pack. So what     |
| 57:42      | you can do is you can set your background. So you can create a colour, set that to set your             |
| 57:47      | background, modify the background to be that colour, invert that colour, and then set your foreground    |
| 57:53      | colour to be that. Now I am setting my foreground colour to be white in my widgets. And this means       |
| 58:02      | that it, they show up on a black background. Because to start with those, they're going,               |
| 58:05      | why is my text not visible? Because I hadn't changed it. And then I realised that I was                |
| 58:09      | setting the title colour and it's not being overwritten. And this is a really smart move on             |
| 58:13      | the widget pack developers part. Because what it does is it means that if I set a colour,               |
| 58:18      | then that's specific. And then if I set a foreground colour, it just goes, hey,                         |
| 58:23      | for all the things where she didn't set a colour, now go and change that. But if I did set a colour,     |
| 58:27      | it leaves it as is, which is pretty cool. Yeah. And you can, since you can, you can set                |
| 58:32      | appearance to dark or light with shortcuts. Is there a way to do an if statement to say if             |
| 58:39      | can it detect whether or not it is in currently in light mode or dark mode? I'm not sure that you      |
| 58:43      | can. I believe that might be a toolbox pro action. I am drawing a blank on that mentally               |
| 58:53      | at the moment. But I believe I'm gonna, I'll look into it. I'm just kind of like thinking out loud.    |
| 58:57      | Is dark mode on is a toolbox pro action. Okay, great. So then you can use that                         |
| 59:03      | for an if statement. And then you could actually even just make your own set of custom                 |
| 59:07      | light mode and dark mode looks for these as well. Just run toolbox pro first to see                    |
| 59:13      | is she in light mode or dark mode and, you know, then set up the colours dependent.                     |
| 59:18      | Be it add a lot of work to building it, but it would be kind of cool.                                  |
| 59:21      | Yeah. And, you know, if you're going to go nuts on, on building this stuff,                            |
| 59:24      | why not add in some of the other great apps that are out there for this?                               |
| 59:29      | I just can't get over how impressive this is. I mean, Charty's amazing too, but Widget Smith           |
| 59:37      | or Widget Pack, there's so many names. Widget Pack is really, it just almost gives you the             |
| 59:44      | ability to do anything with shortcuts in terms of widget creation.                                     |
| 59:47      | I'm going to include some, some screenshots, screenshots, screenshots in the show notes                |
| 59:51      | as well. Because the, the app, the widgets that I created this morning,                                |
| 59:57      | there, there are nothing particularly great, but they look pretty nice. I have to say,                 |
| 01:00:03   | like, you know, I wasn't there trying to make, make them look as pretty as possible.                   |
| 01:00:08   | I literally just set like title, a little bit of bold, added some colour, added an SF symbol,           |
| 01:00:14   | and they look pretty cool. They look professional. I mean, really.                                     |
| 01:00:18   | Exactly. Like they look like something that somebody's actually designed. Now,                         |
| 01:00:24   | I am not a designer and I'm sure there are going to be many designers sending me email.                |
| 01:00:28   | I apologise. I'm not suggesting that you couldn't do a better job because absolutely                   |
| 01:00:33   | somebody with a design background could do a better job. But me, I don't have a design                 |
| 01:00:37   | background. All I can say is, does this look pretty to me? And the answer to this is unequivocally,    |
| 01:00:42   | yes, it's, it's relatively clean and simple and minimalist. I say relatively, I've got colours          |
| 01:00:47   | and icons and stuff in there, which technically are unnecessary, but it looks nice. And it's got       |
| 01:00:52   | all that data in there. So I'm pretty happy with that. Yeah. I feel like both you and I are going      |
| 01:00:58   | to have a lot of fun building apps out of shortcuts or widgets out of shortcuts, which it just kind    |
| 01:01:05   | of, it just so logical when you think about it. Like, you know, we've had shortcuts for a while        |
| 01:01:12   | now. We've had the ability to do powerful things in shortcuts, but there's always been this point      |
| 01:01:16   | of friction of getting data out of shortcuts. Are you going to sit and like talk to your phone and     |
| 01:01:20   | try and get it to give you data? Are you going to, you know, work through a big choose from menu       |
| 01:01:25   | list? But we're just, you're looking for basic information. Why not just have it appear that,          |
| 01:01:32   | I mean, that's the most frictionless way you can get this. This episode of the Automators Podcast      |

| 01:02:03   | those automations at the tip of your fingers? FastScripts is a supercharged script menu for            |
| 01:02:08   | your Mac that makes it easy to organise and run your scripts. With FastScripts, by defining global     |
| 01:02:15   | or app specific keyboard shortcuts, you can customise the behaviours of all your most used Mac apps.    |
| 01:02:21   | You can even use it to override the default keyboard shortcuts in many apps. And the best part is      |
| 01:02:27   | FastScripts is completely free to use with up to 10 keyboard shortcuts. So you can use it as a quick   |
| 01:02:34   | fix for your most urgent needs. And when you decide you want more than 10 shortcuts, unlock premium    |
| 01:02:39   | functionality with a one-time payment of $25. We talk a lot about creating scripts on this show,       |
| 01:02:46   | but Apple doesn't really make it easy to trigger these on your Mac. And that's where FastScripts       |
| 01:02:50   | comes in. FastScripts picks up where Apple leaves off. With FastScripts, you get that enhanced upgrade |
| 01:02:57   | to the [[AppleScript]] menu. And it's a familiar design that you see, but it's a better user interface    |
| 01:03:03   | and easier to get to your scripts. But even more important is the powerful keyboard shortcuts. With    |
| 01:03:09   | FastScripts, you can set global or application specific control of the [[AppleScript]]s at the tip        |
| 01:03:16   | of your fingers. I use these all the time because I have too many [[AppleScript]]s. For example, I have   |
| 01:03:21   | one that creates a whole nested set of folders for new client projects. I tied that to a FastScript    |
| 01:03:28   | script. So when I'm in the Finder, I get a new client, I push one keyboard shortcut and get all        |
| 01:03:33   | my folders generated for me automatically. Because it's all done in [[AppleScript]], I don't need to go   |
| 01:03:39   | any further than FastScripts to make it happen. If you've ever been sitting at your Mac and known you  |
| 01:03:44   | had a script that could solve a problem, but just not sure where it is or how to trigger it,           |
| 01:03:49   | then you need FastScripts. And best of all, listeners to the Automator's podcast can get 20%           |

| 01:04:17   | Rose, this submarine goes deeper into nerdiness.                                                       |
| 01:04:22   | Oh, it does. It does. And I think the first one that we have to talk about, unfortunately,             |
| 01:04:27   | I've not had that much time to use it. I've been playing with it for many other things.                |
| 01:04:32   | MFC Deck, not NFCdeck, MFC Deck. This is by Adam Tow, who was on the show before,                        |
| 01:04:38   | a creator of LaunchCuts and many, many, many amazing shortcuts, like storytelling                      |
| 01:04:45   | ones and things like that. This is an app, which is a widget app inside of the app.                    |
| 01:04:54   | And then it also adds widgets to your home screen. And again, you built these with shortcuts.          |
| 01:05:00   | It's great. I've been playing with it quite a bit, and I'm pretty impressed with it.                   |
| 01:05:04   | Yeah, it is. He covers all the different sizes. It also can create decks. It's a great app.            |
| 01:05:16   | Like you, I have not gone as deep on this as I have on the others, because there's just so much        |
| 01:05:21   | going on right now. And all this stuff is evolving so fast. But good on Adam for getting out on day    |
| 01:05:29   | one. What I really like is one of the examples that he has, and I'm not sure if he's documented        |
| 01:05:34   | this somewhere, but I did see he did a little presentation while this was in beta for a few            |
| 01:05:39   | people. And I saw that he has an office lights widget. And this is a widget I need to steal,           |
| 01:05:46   | because I have home kit stuff everywhere now. And I would really like to know everywhere if my         |
| 01:05:51   | heaters are on, if certain lights are on and things like that. And it's displayed. It's a              |
| 01:05:56   | dark purple widget, a gradient going from sort of mid purple to a dark purple with a home icon in      |
| 01:06:00   | it. And then it's got little light bulbs around the edge. So you can see which lights are on           |
| 01:06:06   | and which lights are off. And this is a work of art, because it's the positioning of where the         |
| 01:06:12   | lights are in his office, I believe. And I just love the fact that you can then see which lights       |
| 01:06:17   | are on and off. And that to me is awesome. And I really want to steal this widget.                     |
| 01:06:21   | Yeah, well, we'll probably come back to this app, because there's just, there's more into it than      |
| 01:06:27   | we have time for today. I mean, several of these apps could get their own show.                        |
| 01:06:32   | Yes. And that's not a promise, but we may well do a show or part show on just one app at some          |
| 01:06:39   | point. And then like another one that falls in the same category. And I think this is the full         |
| 01:06:44   | depth of nerdiness you can get with widgets is [[Scriptable]]. I mean, Scriptable, again,                  |
| 01:06:49   | we had the developer on the show, it's a [[JavaScript]] programming environment for the iPhone,            |
| 01:06:54   | I don't know how else to put it. But, you know, [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]] added widgets.                                   |
| 01:07:01   | Yeah, he didn't just add widgets, he added widgets, people went crazy over widgets in a good way.      |
| 01:07:07   | And there is an entire thread in our forum of people creating widgets, which is both the               |
| 01:07:14   | nerdiest thing I've seen in a while, but also one of the things that made me the happiest of being     |
| 01:07:19   | in a while because I was just there and it's like people are posting [[JavaScript]] code to make widgets.  |
| 01:07:23   | I have stolen so many of these widgets. It's great. I was playing with one a couple of days ago,       |
| 01:07:29   | the sticky note widget, where you could just have it showed like one specific sticky note.             |
| 01:07:34   | And I love that idea. It's great because you just have a sticky note and it's on your home screen.     |
| 01:07:41   | And then once it's done, you leave it and you can change it and make a different one.                  |
| 01:07:48   | And that's been really helpful for getting some things done.                                           |
| 01:07:51   | Yeah. And, you know, anything you can do with JavaScript, you can turn into a widget. Like,            |
| 01:07:55   | I think at one point, I saw [[Jason Snell]] had written a [[JavaScript]] accessing the home weather data       |
| 01:08:02   | from his home weather station in California. We're dealing with a lot of poor air quality              |
| 01:08:07   | as the fires kind of go off and on. So he wanted to get his backyard air quality                       |
| 01:08:12   | in a widget and he did that with the Scriptable, just pulling the data off of his backyard weather     |
| 01:08:17   | station. I mean, this is the kind of stuff you can do with this. And it's not that inaccessible        |
| 01:08:25   | if you go into it. Even if you're not a professional programmer like me, you can,                      |
| 01:08:29   | this JavaScript feels to me a lot like [[AppleScript]]. You just need to find an example and start         |
| 01:08:34   | hacking at it and you can make it work. Yes. The other thing that I like is a lot of people have       |
| 01:08:39   | gone to great lengths to try and share their scripts with you. So there are scripts in the             |
| 01:08:46   | forum, but there is one particular person and his name is Andy. And he's created a widget              |
| 01:08:54   | in Scriptable and it's called conversable. And there's an entire GitHub repo, again,                    |
| 01:08:58   | I've linked it in the show notes, where you can add specific context to your home screen.              |
| 01:09:05   | And it has their name underneath and then a tiny little icon adjacent to the name                      |
| 01:09:10   | for messaging or calling somebody or [[WhatsApp]]. And I love the fact that you can do this because        |
| 01:09:17   | then you have specific people on your home screen, you just tap it and it does that action.            |
| 01:09:21   | And that to me is, it looks so nice as well. And I downloaded this one and give it a try.              |
| 01:09:30   | That's actually how I messaged you earlier today, David. And it's great.                               |
| 01:09:35   | Yeah. And I saw this one and I was thinking, how come Apple didn't do a context widget?                |
| 01:09:42   | I mean, they also didn't add a phone trigger to shortcuts when they added message and email            |
| 01:09:46   | triggers. So I'm guessing they don't think that the iPhone is used for calling anymore,                |
| 01:09:50   | which is kind of funny because it's still called a phone, but anyway.                                  |
| 01:09:54   | Yeah, I know. It is crazy though. And it's like, as we record this, it's very exciting because         |
| 01:10:01   | this is early days and like these apps are updating. It's like every time I turn my phone on,          |
| 01:10:06   | these apps we're talking about have updates out and a lot of them have open public betas.              |
| 01:10:11   | But even the shipping version is feels like a beta because they're pushing updates out so often.       |
| 01:10:17   | And this gives you so much power to, like I said at the beginning of the show,                         |
| 01:10:23   | make your phone your phone. Make it your own.                                                          |
| 01:10:26   | Yeah. And that's one of the things that everybody really needs from their devices.                     |
| 01:10:31   | Their devices need to be theirs so that they can actually do the things that they want to do on it     |
| 01:10:35   | and see the information they want to see. And I'm really pleased to say that with widgets,             |
| 01:10:40   | I am both having a huge amount of fun getting super nerdy writing scripts, creating shortcuts, but     |
| 01:10:47   | I'm also getting that information I need. So I pick up my phone and I see that information             |
| 01:10:53   | right there. And that's it. And I don't need to do anything else. I just pick up my phone.             |
| 01:10:57   | I see the information on the lock screen. I look at my phone and it unlocks and                        |
| 01:11:01   | reveals the information in the notifications. I swipe up. Oh, yep. I've got a podcast tomorrow         |
| 01:11:06   | at 3pm. Perfect. And this is becoming the new hobby land for me. Shortcuts are a hobby for me.         |
| 01:11:16   | I have downtime. I don't want to work. I'll think about a problem I want to solve with a shortcut.     |
| 01:11:20   | And now my mind is spinning with, well, what kind of data can I put on my home screen now?             |
| 01:11:26   | And the answer is all the data, David. All the data.                                                   |
| 01:11:29   | Yes, I agree. For me, one that I really want to dig in harder is Charty,                              |
| 01:11:33   | because I love the way it displays data. And I just, I'm just going to find something relevant.        |
| 01:11:41   | It's like, it's like I have this shiny tool. Now I want to use it on something.                        |
| 01:11:45   | Like you get a new hammer. You want to go hit something with it. And I, I'm not sure what I            |
| 01:11:48   | want to do with it. But I, you know, I'm looking at like days coming up. And I'm like thinking,        |
| 01:11:55   | I've never really been sold on giving me like feedback data on my OmniFocus data.                      |
| 01:12:00   | Because I just, you know, I just think at some point it becomes silly. But at the same time,           |
| 01:12:05   | I just want something on my home screen now. So I don't know what it will be. But,                     |
| 01:12:09   | but I think this will be an ongoing saga for the two of us as we continue on our automators journey.   |
| 01:12:14   | I'm hoping to see a whole load of home related widgets, because I would really like to be able         |
| 01:12:21   | to just see like a quick status. Like I have favourites in the control centre. And that's fine.         |
| 01:12:27   | But I would really like to just be able to like see like, hey, all your blinds are open and the        |
| 01:12:32   | windows are open and the heaters are off. You know, just something like that as a quick thing.         |
| 01:12:37   | Or, you know, it's something that could give me a warning of, hey, your windows open in the            |
| 01:12:42   | office, but the heater is also on. And I think I'm going to have to program that if I'm being          |
| 01:12:47   | honest. But I'm hoping there, there's a couple of great developers out there who are doing home        |
| 01:12:52   | related apps and home kit type controls. So it'd be pretty cool to see that.                           |
| 01:12:58   | Yeah. I'm really thinking kind of what, you know, I talked earlier about the status board on my iPad.  |
| 01:13:04   | I'm thinking about maybe just adding another screen of widgets between my home screen and the          |
| 01:13:09   | app centre and making that a status board. And like, what would that mean to me? You know,             |
| 01:13:14   | what kind of data would I want to see on that? And I'm not sure what it is yet, but                    |
| 01:13:19   | you, dear listener, will probably hear about it. Oh yeah, pair this way. If, if you don't volunteer    |
| 01:13:25   | the information, David, I will, well, I wouldn't actually abduct your dog, but I would threaten        |
| 01:13:30   | to abduct your dog because she's adorable and who wouldn't want to steal. I'm just going to threaten   |
| 01:13:33   | to do it. And then you'll tell us and then everybody's happy. And I might get to borrow                |
| 01:13:36   | your dog for an hour because she's cute. Okay, that does it for today. We want to thank our            |

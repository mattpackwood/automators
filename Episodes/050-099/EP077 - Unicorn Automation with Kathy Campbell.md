| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the podcast where we talk about making your technology                  |
| 00:06      | do all of the hard, grunt work for you. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and as always, I'm                   |
| 00:11      | joined by my fellow co-host, David Sparks. Hey, David, how are you today?                                 |
| 00:14      | I'm great, Rose. I'm looking forward to talking to you and our guest today.                               |
| 00:18      | Yes, and our guest is the one, the only, the unicorn, Kathy Campbell. Welcome to the show,                |
| 00:25      | Kathy.                                                                                                    |
| 00:26      | Hi, I'm so excited to be here.                                                                            |
| 00:28      | All right, quick question before we get started. Are you wearing your headphones with the unicorn         |
| 00:33      | horn?                                                                                                     |
| 00:34      | Duh, of course.                                                                                           |
| 00:36      | They are my, when I wear headphones at my computer, they are, of course, my unicorn                       |
| 00:42      | headphones because that is the only way to work.                                                          |
| 00:46      | Okay, I need a picture of these unicorn headphones.                                                       |
| 00:50      | All right, I will send them over. They are the Brookstone cat ear headphones that I have                  |
| 00:57      | placed a unicorn horn on top.                                                                             |
| 01:00      | Good for you.                                                                                             |
| 01:01      | Well, the reason for this, for people who don't know, Kathy, about your background is                     |
| 01:05      | you are the magical unicorn sidekick. So would you like to give people a little summary of                |
| 01:11      | who you are and why you're a unicorn, aside from obviously having a unicorn horn on your                  |
| 01:15      | headphones?                                                                                               |
| 01:16      | Absolutely. So I am the unicorn sidekick, which means that I love to help companies                       |
| 01:25      | and businesses kind of get their stuff together. So it's a little bit more than just like a               |
| 01:31      | virtual assistant. I call myself an online business manager, but it's really more customised              |
| 01:38      | than that. I help businesses with what they need, whether that's discovering what help                    |
| 01:46      | they need, taking things off of their plate, helping kind of guide their plans and their                  |
| 01:53      | purpose and basically just kind of be that support person to let them be more successful                  |
| 02:01      | with what they're doing so they can concentrate on what they love or are really passionate                |
| 02:07      | about and not have to worry about the little things.                                                      |
| 02:11      | That is an excellent summary. But of course, you don't just do unicorn things. You're                     |
| 02:14      | also a co-host of [[Roboism]] here on [[Relay FM]] with [[Alex Cox]], which is a great podcast.                      |
| 02:20      | So people haven't listened to that one. And after today's show, you think, oh my God,                     |
| 02:23      | I need more Kathy in my life. That's just one of the many ways you can get it.                            |
| 02:28      | And I know that your mascot is the unicorn and you've got it. You're even dressed up                      |
| 02:33      | in the suit on the website. But I honestly think that you could also use a bull terrier                   |
| 02:40      | as your mascot because the times I've interacted with Kathy is when she's working on behalf               |
| 02:46      | of one of her clients and she is like a bull terrier. She gets her teeth into something                   |
| 02:51      | and she doesn't let go until it's done right. And I really appreciate that about you, Kathy.              |
| 02:56      | Oh, thank you so much. That's such a kind way to say that I'm really like needy and                       |
| 03:03      | bossy.                                                                                                    |
| 03:04      | Oh, that's not it at all. It is very much the good kind of bossy. So for people who                       |
| 03:11      | remember the leaf incident at WWDC where I ended up breaking my ankle, Kathy is one                       |
| 03:16      | of the wonderful people who really looked after me all week. And so she's the good kind                   |
| 03:22      | of bossy, making sure that I wasn't overdoing things on what I thought was a sprained ankle.              |
| 03:27      | We both thought it was a sprained ankle and then I got home and I found out it was a very                 |
| 03:30      | broken ankle. But I hadn't damaged it further and that is mostly down to Kathy and her wonderful          |
| 03:36      | unicorn stubbornness of not letting me overdo things.                                                     |
| 03:39      | Well, and like I told you so many times, it was really a pure joy for me as well to have                  |
| 03:48      | a purpose because this was the first WWDC I'd ever been to. I really had no idea what                     |
| 03:58      | I was doing with my time, effort and energy. And so getting to have a goal and a purpose                  |
| 04:05      | and help Rose made my anxiety calmed down a lot. And so really, and this is something                     |
| 04:18      | I've discovered with my therAPIst is that my need to help people is a deep innate trait.                  |
| 04:27      | And I just really lucked out in that I got to make my business do that. It makes everything               |
| 04:33      | so much easier for me because really in the very base part of my soul, I want to help                     |
| 04:39      | everybody and I can't do that. So I do what I can to help the people that I can.                          |
| 04:47      | Well, I think that's an excellent approach and I'm sure that by listening to today's                      |
| 04:52      | podcast, a lot of people are going to be helped by some of the magic that you've got lined                |
| 04:56      | up for us because I've had a sneak peek and I may have pre-interrogated Kathy people.                     |
| 05:01      | It was okay. It was good interrogation, not bad interrogation. So I know that there's                     |
| 05:07      | plenty of magic in the pipeline, if you will.                                                             |
| 05:10      | And the reason really, Kathy, I like having you on this show today is because you are                     |
| 05:14      | not a programmer. You're not coming on the show of someone who writes software for a                      |
| 05:19      | living, but someone who spends your time helping people and helping companies, especially in              |
| 05:24      | the small company clients of yours, get to the next level. And you are always so on top                   |
| 05:31      | of it. And I know there's a lot of automation in there that doesn't really involve writing                |
| 05:35      | Perl code. And I think that could be really helpful to a lot of our listeners today.                      |
| 05:40      | So thank you for coming on.                                                                               |
| 05:42      | Thank you for letting me be a part of this because I will admit I was very concerned                      |
| 05:47      | because I don't know what Perl code is. And so I was worried that you would be able to                    |
| 05:58      | find anything enjoyable to talk about with me. So I'm very happy that I'm here.                           |
| 06:02      | I'll tell you a secret. I don't really know what it is either.                                            |
| 06:06      | I do know Perl and it's not something we're going to talk about on the show because there's               |
| 06:11      | plenty of regular expressions involved there. And let's just say that there are many things               |
| 06:17      | we can communicate through a podcast. Regular expressions are best done. Well, regex101.com               |
| 06:23      | and just have at it, I think is the best way to talk about that. We've talked about it                    |
| 06:28      | before on the surface level. And yeah, I think that's plenty for the time being.                          |
| 06:34      | But my point is there's a lot of people, Kathy, that want to automate that don't have very                |
| 06:38      | particularized technical knowledge about programming their computers. And I do think that you're          |
| 06:46      | doing a lot of automation, whether you acknowledge it or not. And I think that can be of help.            |
| 06:51      | So I guess we should just get started. What platforms are you working on, Kathy?                          |
| 06:57      | Yeah, the majority of my time is on macOS. I have an iMac Pro running Big Sur. And that's                 |
| 07:09      | where I get a lot of my work done, partially because my iPad, I don't know, committed suicide.            |
| 07:17      | I died. But only sometimes like the screen will just turn off and nobody knows what's                     |
| 07:23      | wrong. But so we're recording this show on May 17. And as of Friday, my new iPad will                     |
| 07:32      | be here and I'm very excited to be able to be a little bit more transient with my work                    |
| 07:38      | days, especially since hammock weather is coming. And that makes me very happy. But                       |
| 07:45      | most of my work is on macOS.                                                                              |
| 07:50      | And I think that that is, I'm guessing at least some of that is because of the kind                       |
| 07:54      | of work that you're doing. Some things translate very well to an iPad in a hammock lifestyle              |
| 07:59      | and some things maybe don't translate so well to an iPad in a hammock lifestyle. So how                   |
| 08:05      | do you decide what work you do on what platform? Or is it just what you feel like you're in               |
| 08:09      | the mood to do? Or do you have specific applications that you need that are only available on one         |
| 08:13      | or the other? Yeah, there's a lot of random things that I do that do work pretty much                     |
| 08:21      | only on the computer. But a lot of times, it's a, like, it's a mental statement. It's                     |
| 08:29      | a mental setup in that when I'm working, I'm working. This is my work mode. I sit in my                   |
| 08:36      | office, I'm in my chair, I'm at my computer, and I'm working. And it lets me kind of focus                |
| 08:42      | in that mental status. But also, I don't do, like, a lot of random writing. I don't do                    |
| 08:50      | a ton of stuff that isn't compartmentalised. So a lot of my client work, I try and keep                   |
| 08:58      | it separated out. So one of my main clients, I only work in Google Chrome for them. So,                   |
| 09:06      | and that's a specific hourly project-based, like, payment structure. And so when I'm in                   |
| 09:14      | Chrome, I'm working with this client in particular. And then I have specific windows and styles           |
| 09:21      | of windows for other clients. And there's some, some clients where I shut everything                      |
| 09:28      | else down and I'm only working on this one project. And because of that, it's, yes, the                   |
| 09:35      | iPad is very good at being able to focus on only one thing. But my brain still is like,                   |
| 09:43      | oh, I'm on an iPad, which means I'm watching Netflix, or I'm playing with XYZ. So it,                     |
| 09:53      | it helps my mental brain for the separation of work and play to do my work on the computer.               |
| 10:01      | And then I play on the iPad. Yeah, I think setting context with technology                                |
| 10:06      | is a, is a great idea. I'm going to be really curious to see once you get that new iPad,                  |
| 10:12      | because they are like screamers in terms of speed. You may find you can do some of your                   |
| 10:17      | work on it too. But I guess we'll have to check back on that once you get it.                             |
| 10:22      | Yeah, absolutely. And that's kind of the goal. That's kind of why I actually did go for the               |
| 10:27      | iPad 12.9. I had been the smaller size for, since the first iPad pro, that was my size,                   |
| 10:36      | because it's like, I don't need anything bigger. I have a laptop. Obviously, I don't use it               |
| 10:43      | a whole lot because it's my travel device and haven't been traveling a whole lot. But                     |
| 10:51      | I, I'm very interested to see if I will be able to have the iPad be my travel device for                  |
| 10:58      | the future when I am able to travel again at some point. And so I'm looking forward to                    |
| 11:04      | seeing what I will be able to do because of that whole reason that I have the keyboard                    |
| 11:10      | and a bigger sleeve to stick it in to be able to move around with. So yeah, it'll be really               |
| 11:17      | interesting to see what the future brings.                                                                |
| 11:18      | Yeah, that was one of my lessons of the pandemic was that I really like the big iPad. You know,           |
| 11:24      | I had, I was fortunate to have both of them. I had a used one and I am during the dependent               |
| 11:32      | pandemic, I just never use the smaller one so much so that I ended up giving to my daughter               |
| 11:36      | when she went off to start grad school.                                                                   |
| 11:38      | I am also upgrading to the larger iPad. So we're going to be three 12.9 inch iPads in                     |
| 11:43      | a row there. I am very disappointed that they are not doing pretty colours on this. It's                   |
| 11:50      | just such a shame. So I've gone with silver because, you know, it's fine. And I'm going                   |
| 11:58      | to get a black case because even though I'm sure I could ask you very nicely for a unicorn                |
| 12:03      | sticker, and we could probably manage to sort something out there, I don't trust myself                   |
| 12:08      | with a white iPad case, and especially keyboard where I'm typing on it all the time, actually             |
| 12:12      | have an Apple Magic keyboard here in front of me at the moment. I've just been trying                     |
| 12:17      | it out while podcasting because I already had it and I was not using it and I realised                    |
| 12:21      | it's quite quiet. And oh my gosh, I have to clean this thing like every single day because                |
| 12:25      | it just looks grumpy. And I swear, I'm washing my hands regularly. I guess it's just my hand              |
| 12:29      | cream. So yeah, that's an interesting trial that we have with the iPad Pro, the lack of                   |
| 12:37      | pretty colours, but I'm sure you'll be able to jazz yours up.                                              |
| 12:41      | Somebody tells me I'll make it work. Yeah, I ordered the silver one as well with the                      |
| 12:46      | white keyboard, but I just haven't had the guts to tell Steven Hackett yet because I                      |
| 12:49      | know he's going to give me such a hard time. Well, the good news is, is a Kathy mentioned                 |
| 12:55      | when we're recording earlier, we are recording this a little bit in advance. I'm starting                 |
| 13:00      | a new jobby job just before this show airs. And so I wanted to make sure that we've got                   |
| 13:05      | a little bit of buffer room just in case life goes completely crazy for me. So by the time                |
| 13:10      | this podcast airs, hopefully all three of us will actually have our iPad pros in hand.                    |
| 13:15      | And David will have broken the news to Steven already. So you won't be in too much trouble                |
| 13:19      | there, Sparky.                                                                                            |
| 13:20      | Well, I don't know. I mean, that guy, he's a rough guy. I don't want to make him mad                      |
| 13:24      | at me.                                                                                                    |
| 13:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 13:26      | It's true. It's true.                                                                                     |
| 13:27      | We can call ourselves the lunch tray club, the big iPad owners.                                           |
| 13:31      | Done.                                                                                                     |
| 13:32      | Well, I mean, they're useful for a lot more than that. And Kathy, I know as well as the                   |
| 13:41      | various different clients you work for, you do more than that. So obviously, we mentioned                 |
| 13:47      | your podcasting and you don't just host podcasts here. You also host podcasts over on the incomparable    |
| 13:53      | network, which are more great podcasts that people should be checking out. But you do                     |
| 13:58      | things besides that. I mean, you have a family. They exist. So you also have to do things                 |
| 14:04      | for them. And you also are a photographer and you have cameras and you do stuff with                      |
| 14:11      | that. How do you find integrating all of that? Do you have a special setup to make sure                   |
| 14:18      | that you can do all of these different things? Do you have 80,000 hats on the wall and you                |
| 14:22      | literally put on the unicorn horns when you're being a unicorn and the camera hat when you're             |
| 14:26      | being a photographer? I did actually used to have a spreadsheet, Tiara, that I would                      |
| 14:34      | wear when I was working in spreadsheets because it was way more fun. But no, I don't have                 |
| 14:43      | a camera hat. So I've been a photographer for 13 years now. A professionally paid one                     |
| 14:55      | for about 11 or 12. And my goal with photography is to get a lot of it correct and right in               |
| 15:08      | camera. So I don't have to do a lot of editing outside of it. And over the past decade plus,              |
| 15:15      | I have my process down pretty quickly. Now, the biggest thing that I photograph is my                     |
| 15:25      | daughter's dance studio. I have a great deal with them in that I do the photography and                   |
| 15:34      | videography for them as well as a variety of other things in exchange for my kid to                       |
| 15:40      | dance there, which I think I clearly have the better deal because obvious dancing all                     |
| 15:46      | the time. But that being said, I will take upwards for any competitions that we're at.                    |
| 15:55      | I'm taking a lot of action shots. I'm taking between two and 4,000 photos for each competition.           |
| 16:03      | I don't have the energy in my life to sit and touch every one of them to make them quote                  |
| 16:12      | unquote perfect. So I use a lot of automation to get them to be a level and quality that                  |
| 16:22      | allows them to be sent out and get done within 24 hours. So they're not sitting on my hard                |
| 16:29      | drive. Oh, I'll get to them later. I like to get in, get them done, send them out and                     |
| 16:35      | then check it off my list.                                                                                |
| 16:38      | That is something you do appear to be very good at doing, checking things off your list.                  |
| 16:42      | Whenever I send you something, you get back to me incredibly quickly. And that's always                   |
| 16:47      | a fun thing. Whether or not I'm sending cute cat pictures or something more important like,               |
| 16:53      | hey, can you come on automators? You are very much on top of things, it seems so. I'm fascinated          |
| 16:59      | as we dive into this show to discover all of the secrets and the magic behind us that                     |
| 17:04      | makes it work.                                                                                            |
| 17:05      | I wish my quick communication was something magical. It's more so based in anxiety and                    |
| 17:18      | that I'm always constantly afraid of forgetting or missing something. And so I like to just               |
| 17:28      | reply back quickly so that I know it's done and taken care of and I don't accidentally                    |
| 17:36      | mark something red that then has to be remembered. And so it's easier for me to say, yeah, sure,          |
| 17:44      | I'd love to. And then go back to whatever I was doing. So that mental adjustment and                      |
| 17:52      | hopping around. I know anyone that works in the productivity space has heard of deep work                 |
| 17:59      | and being able to sit and focus. And that is not how my brain works. That's not how                       |
| 18:06      | I am really able to get through life for good or bad. The anxiety that exists around it                   |
| 18:15      | allows me to be really on top of things for my clients. So if I don't reply to your text                  |
| 18:21      | right away, I might be dead or sleep. That does occasionally happen. Yes. Yes. It kind                    |
| 18:28      | of reminds me of a statement you made earlier that you want to capture the image in the                   |
| 18:33      | camera. You don't want to work on it later. The same thing comes to the communications.                   |
| 18:38      | If you don't deal with communications immediately, you need a process to manage when you respond          |
| 18:44      | to it and how to deal with it. So it's a variation of a theme for you, really. Yes. Yes. It's             |
| 18:50      | very true. One could say that I'm highly efficient, but really, I'm just lazy.                            |

| 19:41      | swapping that colon for a semicolon in the wrong place, and even sometimes just good                     |
| 19:47      | old fashioned replacing my name when I inevitably accidentally capitalised the second letter.             |
| 19:52      | It boosts my productivity by eliminating my concerns.                                                     |

| 20:11      | Okay, Kathy, you say lazy. I say smart. So tell us about your photography magic that                      |
| 20:19      | you've got going on here, because this is something I definitely struggled with back                      |
| 20:23      | when I had a DSLR. I don't have one anymore because I realised it was generating a lot                    |
| 20:27      | of work and then I was feeling bad about not doing stuff. And so I decided that I was just                |
| 20:31      | going to eliminate that from my life. But clearly, I can do that because for me, that's                   |
| 20:35      | a hobby. If you're being paid to take pictures or you're taking pictures in exchange for                  |
| 20:41      | your daughter getting dance lessons or whatever it is, then you can't just say, no, I'm not               |
| 20:46      | going to do that. So how do you combat this being lazy, which I personally think is the                   |
| 20:52      | wrong way to frame it. I think you're being fairly smart with your desire to not actually                 |
| 20:58      | have to spend time touching up every single individual photo.                                             |
| 21:02      | Yeah, so I'm really excited to walk through kind of my process for this, mainly so you                    |
| 21:10      | can tell me how to do it better. When it comes to automation, I am not extremely, I don't                 |
| 21:19      | like to just sit and tinker with things. I highly recommend episode 38 of Roboism, where                  |
| 21:27      | I kind of talk about my discovery of the Stream Deck and [[Keyboard Maestro]] and learning how                |
| 21:35      | to do things, mainly because it gave away my secret in that I utilised friends like                       |
| 21:41      | Rose to do the things for me and figure out how to make them work because I am not a tinkerer.            |
| 21:50      | I don't like to tinker or create things from scratch or even really think, hmm, how could                 |
| 21:58      | I make this do work for me so much as this is something that I'm doing often. So I will                   |
| 22:06      | Google something and this is how it's done. So then I'll just put it into work. So I'm                    |
| 22:12      | really looking forward to being able to be told how to do this better. So feel free to                    |
| 22:18      | send any suggestions to me. So after I spend multiple hours taking photos for the dancers,                |
| 22:29      | I get home and I load up the card and then I transfer all of the images over to, I have                   |
| 22:37      | a folder in my finder in my drive that's called working sessions. And this is where any images            |
| 22:46      | that I need to work on live. I don't transfer them into the like stable backup until after                |
| 22:55      | I've submitted the images and everything looks great. So in the working sessions, I clearly               |
| 23:02      | name the folder usually with very specific things because I do go back a lot of times                     |
| 23:09      | to find images for particular events because somebody is like looking for whatever. So                    |
| 23:19      | after I've transferred the files off of the card, I take the card and I put it into, you                  |
| 23:26      | know, the little case because I cycle through my SD cards so that they don't get overworked.              |
| 23:31      | So there's less chance for them to have issues in the future. And then I load those images                |
| 23:39      | up into Lightroom. Lightroom is where I do a lot of the very basic processing. So because                 |
| 23:47      | the dancers are moving really fast, and I want to make sure I have a crisp, like, crisp                   |
| 23:56      | clean image, I have to have the shutter really fast, which means a lot of times it's really               |
| 24:03      | dark. So I have to go in and make sure everything's lightened up and brighter. But because I have         |
| 24:09      | the settings the same, I fix one and then I sync the settings across everything. This                     |
| 24:17      | means that I don't have to go in and make minor adjustments unless for some reason there                  |
| 24:22      | is lighting changes. And then I go through and I very quickly will pick the images that                   |
| 24:32      | I want. I don't do anything with the images that are not useful to me because if they're                  |
| 24:39      | not useful, I don't need them. So in Lightroom, the letter P puts a flag on the image. So                 |
| 24:46      | I am sitting here and I'm just going with my gut. I'm not sitting and saying, well,                       |
| 24:53      | this I guess is better than the other one. Like, boom, like it or not, move on. So it                     |
| 25:01      | will usually take me maybe 20 to 30 minutes to review about 2000 images.                                  |
| 25:10      | So Kathy, as you go through these pictures, are you looking at them as thumbnails or full                 |
| 25:14      | screen? You know, how are you making those decisions?                                                     |
| 25:17      | Yeah, I look at it full screen for the very specific image that I'm looking at. I don't                   |
| 25:25      | care what else is around it. I'm looking to see if it's an image that is worthwhile, like                 |
| 25:33      | is it an actual good pose? Are people's faces showing? Is it a random in between pose and                 |
| 25:43      | is it in focus? And if the answer is yes to the good parts, I will flag it as a keep and                  |
| 25:50      | move on. I usually am making that decision in a split second. I'm not going to debate,                    |
| 25:59      | oh, well, maybe this one's better. It doesn't matter. Everything is going to be like, there's             |
| 26:07      | so many choices for the viewer. These are images that the parents of the dancers will                     |
| 26:16      | look at or the dancers themselves, especially like for the high school team. But I don't                  |
| 26:24      | need to find just the award winning photos because something that I might never use for                   |
| 26:32      | any sort of promotional or advertising quality will be something that will be someone's favourite          |
| 26:38      | image because their child was doing something cool. And so I keep it very minimal of, hey,                |
| 26:47      | is it in focus? Is it a dynamic-ish image? Yes, cool, move on. This allows me to just                     |
| 26:56      | process through it. I'm not overthinking it. I usually will have something running on Netflix             |
| 27:02      | or YouTube or whatever in the other screen as I'm sitting here and just going through,                    |
| 27:07      | get it done, and move on.                                                                                 |
| 27:09      | Well, yeah, you said you're looking at like 20 to 30 minutes for a couple of thousand                     |
| 27:14      | images here. That's something where I'm guessing you've probably got a lot faster at this over            |
| 27:20      | time. You're much better at judging those criteria that you set out for yourself faster                   |
| 27:26      | now than you were even probably a year ago just because you get used to it over time.                     |
| 27:32      | Though I'm guessing maybe the pandemic had a slight impact there on the amount of photography             |
| 27:36      | you were doing because I'm guessing something might have got canceled. So maybe not compared              |
| 27:40      | to a year ago, but say three years ago, you're probably being able to make these decisions                |
| 27:47      | much faster, which I think is a kind of automation in and of itself. You've hacked your brain             |
| 27:51      | basically to do this.                                                                                     |
| 27:53      | Yeah, absolutely. And I think too, I've become a better photographer. So I'm not shooting                 |
| 28:04      | and spraying like they, a lot of times they will say, you know, just clicking the thing.                  |
| 28:10      | I'm very, very like specific about the images that I'm taking. So especially towards the                  |
| 28:21      | end of the season, I've seen most of these dances. So I know the big moments that come                    |
| 28:28      | in. I know the bits of the specific dancer will do something cool. So I know that I can                   |
| 28:34      | wait and be ready to take that shot. And so that means that there's going to be less                      |
| 28:43      | awkward images before and after because I hit the leap at the right time type of a thing.                 |
| 28:50      | So over the years, I have definitely become a better photographer and in exchange that                    |
| 28:56      | has also made this process significantly easier.                                                          |
| 28:59      | I was going to say, do you get to watch rehearsals of this so that you can almost rehearse your           |
| 29:03      | photography? And obviously the answer is yes, which I think is something else, which, you                 |
| 29:08      | know, a lot of times we forget about with automation in general, being able to see how                    |
| 29:13      | an entire process goes so that you can figure out where the moment is to, in your case,                   |
| 29:18      | take the photo or, you know, for me, it might be implement a script, you know, that, you                  |
| 29:22      | know, that is a key part.                                                                                 |
| 29:24      | So can I just clarify when you go through them and you figure out a keeper, what are                      |
| 29:29      | you doing to mark it as a keeper? And what do you do with the ones that are not keepers?                  |
| 29:34      | Yeah, so in Lightroom, the keystroke P will flag it. And then when after I've done reviewing              |
| 29:43      | it, I set the filter to only show the flagged images. And so anything that's not a keeper,                |
| 29:51      | I don't touch. There's no special flag. There's no, you know, oh, I'll turn, you know, attack             |
| 29:58      | these all green. If I don't want it, I don't want to mess with it. I don't want to spend                  |
| 30:03      | any time with it. I don't need to deal with it at all. And it just lives in the raw format                |
| 30:11      | in the folder to keep for pretty much ever, eventually. So as I cycle, okay, let me take                  |
| 30:20      | a step back. Each of my images, like groups of images, each session or whatever, lives                    |
| 30:28      | in a specific folder, that folder while I'm working on it is in the working sessions.                     |
| 30:33      | And then when it's done, it moves to a year folder. So I can easily find anything from                    |
| 30:41      | the back, the past 13 years or whatever that I've been taking photos. Usually at the end                  |
| 30:48      | of the year, I will go in and compress the raw file folder of images from the year before.                |
| 31:00      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 31:01      | Because I will usually want to access stuff for the current year, but stuff that's two                    |
| 31:07      | years ago, I won't necessarily need. So I will compress the files and then delete the                     |
| 31:12      | raw. So I have just a zipped file of all of the raw files available there. So eventually                  |
| 31:19      | it will kind of get, you know, discarded in that sense, but I never really delete anything.               |
| 31:25      | Probably should, but yeah, I don't.                                                                       |
| 31:29      | So one bit of automation I would recommend there is considering [[Hazel]] as a mechanism to                   |
| 31:35      | put those folders where they belong. Like you could tag a folder is working and it would                  |
| 31:40      | hold it in a working space. And then as soon as you're done with it, you could tag it as                  |
| 31:44      | done or something like that. And it would automatically move it into a folder by year.                    |
| 31:49      | [[Hazel]] has a really cool feature where it can move it into a sub folder automatically and                  |
| 31:54      | you can do it by year.                                                                                    |
| 31:55      | Okay. That's very cool. I've heard about [[Hazel]] a couple times now. And so I think this is                 |
| 32:03      | just a sign that I need to set up some time with Rose to come and screen share with me                    |
| 32:07      | and tell me what to do. I can definitely do that.                                                         |
| 32:11      | And the other thing that [[Hazel]] can do, which might be useful for you here, because I'm                    |
| 32:14      | guessing a lot of dance competitions probably happen in the same month as well. And so you'll             |
| 32:20      | know, you know, what month something was in. If you have lots of dance competitions in                    |
| 32:24      | a year, you're going to have a lot of folders in that year. You can also use Hazel's sort                 |
| 32:29      | of into sub folders to sort it into a folder based on the year and then another folder                    |
| 32:33      | inside of that based on the month. So say then you just have, you know, May's dance competitions          |
| 32:39      | from 2021 and they all end up in one folder and that's just magically done for you, but                   |
| 32:44      | only when you finish working on it. And you've done your thing.                                           |
| 32:48      | Yeah, that sounds really great because I've been very hesitant to do a lot of automation                  |
| 32:54      | in this mainly because I don't understand it super well, but then turning around and                      |
| 33:00      | I don't want something to get moved that I'm not done with because then I have to try and                 |
| 33:05      | find it and or it messes up my to-do list because it's not in the working sessions folder                 |
| 33:10      | anymore. So I don't know that it needs to be worked on. So that's really, really wonderful.               |
| 33:17      | And I will start exploring that for sure.                                                                 |
| 33:22      | A lot of people want to use [[Hazel]] with automatic trigger. So automation usually is two steps.             |
| 33:28      | There's something that triggers it and then it does an action and [[Hazel]] will do triggers                  |
| 33:33      | based on the contents of the file. So like if you get a PDF document and it says, you                     |
| 33:39      | know, Oregon Electric in it and such your electric bill, you know, at looking at the                      |
| 33:44      | contents alone, [[Hazel]] could rename it and put it in the file or the folder where you                      |
| 33:48      | keep your electric bills. So that's cool that it works automatically. But don't underestimate             |
| 33:53      | with [[Hazel]] the ability to use a tag as a trigger because those are rock solid because you manually        |
| 33:59      | apply the tag. It just takes a moment, but then it always moves it to the exact place                     |
| 34:04      | you want. You don't accidentally drag it to the wrong place or and it can automatically                   |
| 34:09      | sort it into subfolders. And I do think a lot of people playing with [[Hazel]], they want                     |
| 34:13      | to make that first step, that trigger automation automatic. And a lot of times that's not necessary.      |
| 34:20      | Just create a simple tag based automation and it'll do everything for you. In fact, that's                |
| 34:24      | how I manage all the podcast files. Once we finish recording today, I'll tag the files                    |
| 34:29      | and it'll put it in a specific place and then everything, you know, happens for the show.                 |
| 34:35      | And there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. In my case, I actually have people at my                       |
| 34:39      | show pop up and ask me, but you know, it's the manual trigger, I think is something that,                 |
| 34:45      | you know, people don't necessarily think about. I mean, as well as adding a tag to something,             |
| 34:50      | the other option you could do is just have a folder, not a folder action, sorry, a service                |
| 34:55      | that you use either through something like drop zone, or you could do something with                      |
| 35:00      | automator to have something show up and find her under the right click menu with under                    |
| 35:05      | services that says, Hey, move it to my make magic happen folder. And I say this because                   |
| 35:11      | I have a Dropbox folder, it's not called make magic happen, it's called automated actions,                |
| 35:17      | because make magic happen gets sorted to the middle, automated actions gets sorted to the                 |
| 35:21      | top. So there you go, alphabetical pro tip there. But I put stuff in that folder and                      |
| 35:29      | that has sub folders for make this magic happen on it basically. And then, you know, sometimes            |
| 35:35      | stuff gets added via Zapier or something like something else. But other times it's me manually            |
| 35:41      | going, Yeah, I'm just going to throw this in here. And then and then [[Hazel]] does the                       |
| 35:44      | magic on it and it ends up in the right place. And that's it. Thank you very much. So, you                |
| 35:49      | know, I think manual triggers for automations or something which everybody should look at.                |
| 35:54      | And honestly, that's probably if you're, especially when you're getting started with                      |
| 35:57      | this stuff, it's where you should start because that way you can sit there and you can watch              |
| 36:01      | it do the thing. And then you can go, Okay, that did the thing, right? Or, Oh, that didn't                |
| 36:07      | do the thing, right? What happened there and figure it out. And especially if you're concerned            |
| 36:12      | about losing things, which you know, I understand you don't, you can't exactly go back and reshoot        |
| 36:16      | a dance competition. I mean, Hazel's not going to trash things without asking without you                 |
| 36:21      | explicitly setting that up. Sorry. But, you know, it's nice to know what's happening.                     |
| 36:26      | And also the preview, preview rule tip in [[Hazel]] specifically is excellent because then you                |
| 36:32      | can see exactly which parts of the trigger it matches and go through things.                              |
| 36:36      | And since we're on loading [[Hazel]], one more tip. The reason I like the tag based for someone               |
| 36:41      | is it's 100% reliable, you know, you put a tag on, that's something you do manually.                      |
| 36:47      | So it always works. But if you want to get fancy with the automatic filing stuff, you                     |
| 36:52      | can have the trigger condition be basically an or statement or what they call as any.                     |
| 36:59      | So any, if any of the following things happen, then move the, the, the folder. So one of                  |
| 37:05      | them can be a tag apply, but another one could be something automatic like it has the word                |
| 37:10      | organ electric in it. So you have the, the automatic trigger in there to hopefully triggers,              |
| 37:17      | but sometimes the OCR didn't go right. Or for whatever reason, the rule didn't fire                       |
| 37:23      | and you see it there, then all you have to do is add a tag and then it'll, it'll satisfy                  |
| 37:27      | the other condition. The point I'm making is a trigger can be one of many conditions                      |
| 37:32      | if you do it right. So that's kind of a fun trick.                                                        |
| 37:36      | That's really cool. Yeah. I would highly recommend that for people who are yet to get started.            |
| 37:43      | And of course the, the other beauty with [[Hazel]] is, you know, you apply rules to a folder.                 |
| 37:48      | So you could have a, a folder for bills, um, where you just dump all of the PDFs of your                  |
| 37:53      | bills and then stuff magically happens to them, but your photos never go into that folder                 |
| 37:57      | and the rules in that folder never apply to your photos. You know, it's, it is, don't                     |
| 38:02      | cross the streams, um, you know, but with folders. Wonderful.                                             |
| 38:06      | Kathy's like, what are these people talking about? I just came on to discuss my photos.                   |
| 38:12      | No, see, this is what I mean. I want other people to do the work for me so I don't have                   |
| 38:19      | to think or like sit and research. How do I do this? Because my time is better spent                      |
| 38:25      | on other things.                                                                                          |
| 38:27      | And that is the beauty of automation. There's always going to be somebody out there who                   |
| 38:30      | can give you a pointer in the right direction that says, Hey, like this is how, this is                   |
| 38:34      | how you should do things. Um, and, uh, you know, and that's, that's what the automation                   |
| 38:38      | community is all about. They're a bunch of very, very nice people. Um, and, uh, if you                    |
| 38:43      | ask somebody for help, you'll probably get about 10 people queuing up all with their                      |
| 38:47      | own opinion. And then you have to sit and decide which one, um, which of course, you                      |
| 38:51      | know, it takes a while, but it's nice to get a bunch of different options. And I'm sure                   |
| 38:56      | there's going to be some people in our forums going, Hey, did you know you can do this with               |
| 38:59      | Lightroom? Um, and the answer to that will be, I didn't know I could do that with Lightroom               |
| 39:04      | because I don't really use Lightroom all that much. I have it. Um, but that's because                     |
| 39:08      | I, I got it with Photoshop. Um, it's the Adobe Creative Cloud Deal. Um, but, uh, you know,                |
| 39:14      | I, I personally don't use Lightroom. So I'm definitely out of, out of, uh, my depth there,                |
| 39:19      | but [[Hazel]], [[Hazel]], I use and [[Hazel]], I can help you with.                                                   |
| 39:22      | Yeah. That's amazing.                                                                                     |
| 39:24      | And once you learn [[Hazel]], it's like that becomes the world's biggest hammer and everything                |
| 39:28      | is a nail. But, but also just to your earlier point, Kathy, where you said, Well, I don't,                |
| 39:35      | you know, get into the weeds on this stuff. I, you know, I use other people's work. A                     |
| 39:39      | lot of automators do that. I mean, myself included. I mean, almost every [[AppleScript]]                     |
| 39:44      | I've ever written started with somebody else's AppleScript. Um, very few have been written               |
| 39:48      | from scratch. So it's okay. You know, and I think that's kind of embraced in the community.               |
| 39:53      | That's why there's all these websites like, you know, automators.fm where you can go in                   |
| 39:57      | and talk to other people and say, Hey, how did you scratch that itch? You know, and somebody              |
| 40:01      | has a cool solution.                                                                                      |
| 40:05      | This episode of the automators is brought to you by Sync Up, a OneDrive podcast that takes                 |
| 40:09      | you behind the scenes of OneDrive. It's always great when you find a new podcast that can                 |
| 40:15      | teach you about something technology. And if you use OneDrive, you need to check out Sync Up,              |
| 40:20      | the OneDrive podcast. If you're looking for a new show to listen to, Sync Up takes you                     |
| 40:24      | behind the scenes of OneDrive so you can learn about how to connect files, share your documents           |
| 40:30      | and work from anywhere. And you'll get to hear about the design and development side                      |
| 40:34      | of things too. Each show covers a dedicated topic, along with guest interviews, news and                  |
| 40:40      | announcements, plus a special topic outside of the technology norm.                                       |
| 40:45      | Topics include things like external sharing with OneDrive, automation, which of course                    |
| 40:49      | is one of our favourites here on the automators podcast, and data security, which is also                  |
| 40:54      | super important. And one of the great features of OneDrive that it really takes data security             |
| 40:59      | so seriously. In the most recent episode of OneDrive, they had one of the program managers                |
| 41:05      | for OneDrive on to talk about this new feature, OneDrive Sync Admin Reports, that empower IT              |
| 41:13      | administrators with actionable insights about the adoption and health of the Sync client.                 |
| 41:18      | Sync Reports allow you to know exactly what happened with your stuff, and it's a great                    |
| 41:23      | feature that's been recently added to OneDrive. Why not get all the details from one of the               |
| 41:28      | program managers? So go and listen to it now. Just search for Sync Up wherever you get your               |
| 41:33      | podcast. That's S-Y-N-C-U-P, or just click the link in the show notes and check it out.                   |
| 41:40      | Our thanks to Sync Up and Microsoft for their support of the automators podcast and all                   |
| 41:45      | of Relay FM.                                                                                              |
| 41:46      | All right, so you've picked your favourites. You've got the best dance images there are.                   |
| 41:54      | What do you do next?                                                                                      |
| 41:55      | So after I export out of Lightroom, I then, so the images are now very, boring is the                     |
| 42:04      | wrong word, but they don't necessarily have my particular style. I have several Photoshop                 |
| 42:16      | actions that I have developed over the years, again, based off of other people's images                   |
| 42:23      | and actions that they have created. I then have gone in and tweaked everything and made                   |
| 42:28      | it exactly particular to how I like it. Instead of opening each image and applying those actions          |
| 42:37      | and then saving it into the edited file and moving on to the next one, that clearly is                    |
| 42:43      | not very doable with about 1,000 to 3,000 images because I usually will have about half                   |
| 42:54      | of the photos that I've taken are keepers. So in order to process this, I use the automation              |
| 43:03      | pieces that are built into Photoshop. So in Photoshop, there's a thing called Automate                    |
| 43:10      | and then Batch. And I created an action that runs my particular looking actions, the colouring             |
| 43:20      | and whatnot. And then it also has a resize the images so that they're not the 5,000 pixels                |
| 43:32      | because nobody needs that. And it loads and places a watermark on the smaller images.                     |
| 43:42      | This watermark is specifically customised for each event so that my dance parents will                    |
| 43:51      | know that this really cool leap was taken at the extreme dance competition on this date                   |
| 43:59      | for this year for a very particular year. Again, I don't want to sit here, file, load,                    |
| 44:06      | image, place an image, etc. So my action that I created will pull active watermark. And the               |
| 44:17      | active watermark is the watermark that I have customised and resized and saved so that it                 |
| 44:24      | has the particular competition on it. And so I have the saved version of the original                     |
| 44:32      | file and then I save it again as active watermark. So this is constantly changing. So it pulls            |
| 44:38      | the right watermark for the right competition. And then in Batch, I can choose the action                 |
| 44:47      | that I want to run. And I choose the source folder. And then I can save those files in                    |
| 44:53      | the edited folder. And the edited folder is titled a space edits so that it runs to the                   |
| 45:03      | top of the folder. And I am able to click OK. And it runs. And I go off and I do something                |
| 45:12      | else. It just runs in Photoshop in the background. It will let me know if there's any errors.             |
| 45:17      | But I have cleaned it up so much that there are no errors. So I don't actually know how                   |
| 45:23      | long it takes because I'm not paying attention to it. And it just does what it needs to do.               |
| 45:30      | That sounds like a perfect automation to me. It does what it needs to do. And you go off                  |
| 45:34      | and you get a coffee or you do whatever it is that you need to do. And then you come                      |
| 45:37      | back and your computer has magically gone through and generated this whole pile of images                 |
| 45:41      | with your custom watermark on. I love it. Yes. It's great. And it lets me get                             |
| 45:47      | the images out within 24 hours of having taken them. I think that's another kind of automation            |
| 45:53      | hack as well. You've got this deadline that you've imposed upon yourself, you know, 24                    |
| 45:57      | hours. I mean, I'm sure if something crazy came up, you know, you'd be willing to let                     |
| 46:00      | it slide a little bit. But because you've got that 24 hours, you're really optimising                     |
| 46:05      | everything of how quickly can I get this done. And that's where the automation, you know,                 |
| 46:09      | really serves you because you have other things that you also need to do during that time                 |
| 46:14      | period. And so having, you know, Photoshop go through and add all these watermarks,                       |
| 46:19      | I mean, I think I would personally go insane if I had to put the watermark                                |
| 46:23      | on five photos consecutively, let alone a thousand. So, you know, it's smart to deal                      |
| 46:30      | with that just so that you can, you know, wander off and get a coffee or do any of the                    |
| 46:36      | probably 80 bajillion other things that need doing. Yes. Yes. There's lots of things to do.               |
| 46:42      | And I would much rather have the machines working to do the work than doing it myself.                    |
| 46:49      | I think this is a good automation example in the sense that we all have our limits, right?                |
| 46:56      | If you had to take three pictures every week and apply that process to them,                              |
| 47:01      | you probably would not have automated it, right? But instead, you've got hundreds or thousands and        |
| 47:07      | multiple times. And clearly, that hits the automation threshold for just about anybody.                   |
| 47:12      | It's like, I'm not going to sit and do all these filters to 400 images every week. You know,              |
| 47:17      | that'd be like a full-time job. And that's the decision all of us automakers have to make.                |
| 47:22      | It's like, at what point do we hit that threshold? Yeah. And sometimes there's images that like,          |
| 47:31      | like I'm not perfect. So stuff is not always level. And I haven't figured out a way, well,                |
| 47:39      | the machine learning for like auto-fixing like the horizon lines is still not great.                      |
| 47:47      | And so that's something that I've just like passed on. I don't let that mess with me,                     |
| 47:56      | but I also make sure everyone knows, hey, if you want to print this out or do something with this         |
| 48:04      | other than just have it on your computer, let me know and I'll fix it. Yeah. But that's for later         |
| 48:11      | and only if somebody wants it. Because I setting those boundaries on myself and my mental sanity          |
| 48:20      | were way more important than making sure that the only images that go out are perfection.                 |
| 48:25      | Yeah. And I'm sure you'll get a bunch of people who'll probably be like, yeah, actually,                  |
| 48:29      | if you could just send me the file, then I can straighten that up myself because pretty much              |
| 48:35      | everybody has a program on their computer that can straighten images, you know,                           |
| 48:38      | where they can manually slide it around or they'd be happy with whatever machine learning there is.       |
| 48:42      | But by deferring that work until it's actually required, that's a productivity trick there.               |
| 48:50      | You know, don't do things that aren't actually needed. Yes. Because a lot of the time people              |
| 48:54      | will be just fine with it as it is, you know, they're just going to save it on their phone anyway.        |
| 48:59      | So they can show everybody else how well their precious darling is doing in dance. And I'm sure           |
| 49:04      | all of them are doing very well because, you know, they're in competitions. So that is great.             |
| 49:07      | Exactly. So they've all worked really hard. I'm very proud.                                               |
| 49:12      | I also think, though, that that is something that you could bring the Rosemary Orchard Automation         |
| 49:17      | Service to bear for you. Just like you could automate a process where like you email the full             |
| 49:24      | size image or put it in a shared folder very easily. So that that may be next level for you.              |
| 49:31      | Yeah. I will send out a request to that agency. And hopefully fingers crossed, she'll reply to me.        |
| 49:41      | Well, we'll have to see. We'll have to see. I mean, you know, we still need to make sure                  |
| 49:47      | that I get some time to sit down with you in your Stream Deck, because I know you've been                 |
| 49:50      | playing with that. And you mentioned it before, are you using the Stream Deck with your photography       |
| 49:56      | workflow at all? Or are you still using keyboard and mouse for that pretty much?                          |
| 50:01      | Yeah, I'm still using keyboard and mouse for that, mainly because, partially because, again, I haven't    |
| 50:06      | had the time slash energy to sit and think about what I could use it for. But also, it's so easy          |
| 50:16      | to just click, click, click that and making sure that things go from the right folder to the right        |
| 50:24      | folder, et cetera. I'm sure there probably is a way. But yeah, I haven't had a chance to go through       |
| 50:32      | and tinker it together. One thing you could do with the [[Keyboard Maestro]], and I know you're               |
| 50:37      | already doing this on your Mac keyboard. But this is kind of an interesting thing. I process email        |
| 50:42      | often. I'm sorry, not [[Keyboard Maestro]] on the Stream Deck. But I process email with the stream            |
| 50:48      | deck where I've set buttons to move to certain folders or archive or delete. And since I have             |
| 50:57      | three primary accounts, I've got the personal Mac sparking the legal. I've got these buttons set up.      |
| 51:02      | So I've got like a little, like quick entry board on the Stream Deck. One of the buttons I use,           |
| 51:09      | and people may not think of this, is I've just put arrow keys on the Stream Deck. And it's just           |
| 51:17      | pressing the down arrow or the up arrow. So you can navigate quickly. Like I could see you going          |
| 51:22      | through when you do your initial review of your photos with a Stream Deck, you could put the              |
| 51:28      | navigation keys, the P key, and whatever other keys you use. And you can zip through them using           |
| 51:35      | the Stream Deck. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. Or would it be possible you could combine      |
| 51:41      | the P and the arrow key as well. So that yeah, like it would take you to the next photo. And so           |
| 51:47      | then you just have two buttons. And so you press either the flag and next or next. And that's it.         |
| 51:53      | Okay. And then it does. Thank you. Next. Thank you. There we go. I'm just going to double check           |
| 52:01      | right now here live on air. Because there's so I think if you're doing this natively in the stream        |
| 52:08      | deck software, your P and next action or button is going to be a multi action. And then inside of         |
| 52:17      | that you you have two hotkeys one where you do P. And then one where you do do the the the next.          |
| 52:27      | So you just press P. Yeah. And then you add another for for right arrow. There we go. And so              |
| 52:33      | that's a multi action. And then the other one can just be a right arrow. And then you can get fancy       |
| 52:39      | because I know you're good at this stuff and make them into really pretty icons. I am very lazy. And      |
| 52:45      | I just use [[Stephen Millard\|Stephen Millard's]] excellent Stream Deck icon generation with shortcuts. So you know that        |
| 52:54      | works for me. And actually I have a back button in the bottom right hand corner of all of my              |
| 52:59      | Stream Deck profiles which takes me back to my main action. But there we go. So we've officially          |
| 53:05      | helped you live on air. Everybody can always have it. And then you can add another button that you        |
| 53:12      | know every time you press it your computer just says something like kabam. You know just to make          |
| 53:18      | you feel good. Well this was a little discussion we were having before the show. What do unicorns         |
| 53:23      | sound like? Because if you could have like it make a unicorn sound when it finishes doing your            |
| 53:29      | automation for watermarking that would be amazing. But what would the unicorn sound like?                 |
| 53:35      | Sparkles. That's a good one. Good answer. I'm going deeper down this because now as I think               |
| 53:43      | about it you could also apply a tag with a Stream Deck. So you press a button to apply the tag and        |
| 53:49      | then haze on the background auto files it. We're going to automate you Kathy. I love it. We're            |
| 53:55      | going to get this done. I am here for it. Yes. Especially because as COVID starts to recede               |
| 54:04      | we will have more competitions and I'm very excited. Yes. This is both a great thing because it means     |
| 54:10      | that Avi is going to get to participate in more things but it's also more work for you.                   |
| 54:16      | So let's temper the excitement of yay more competitions with and more automations to make                 |
| 54:22      | the more work not as much more work as it could be. As we're thinking this through Rose now let's         |
| 54:27      | think about the next step where she goes into Photoshop and applies the filter. I don't know              |
| 54:31      | that that really needs a stream back because that's you do it once manually and then you apply to all     |
| 54:36      | right. I mean there's not a whole lot to do there with a stream back. Yeah because it I am selecting      |
| 54:42      | the the folder to pull it from and selecting the folder to send it to you and then it's done. So it       |
| 54:50      | usually takes 10 seconds. Are you using default folder X at all to help with this?                        |
| 54:57      | I don't know what that is so that would be okay. So default folder X is a is a very useful tool           |
| 55:04      | for automation on macOS in that basically it allows you to set default save folders for                   |
| 55:10      | applications but one of the other things it does which is honestly pretty much what I use it for          |
| 55:16      | about 98% of the time is when you get that open file dialogue or one of these select a folder             |
| 55:23      | dialogues then you can mouse over any open finder window and click on it and it just selects that for     |
| 55:31      | you. And so both of those options might potentially be useful for you there because I'm guessing you      |
| 55:40      | probably you know have the folders open and finder anyway at some point. So if you use something like     |
| 55:46      | Moom to rearrange them on your screen and then you can just click click done and the magic happens.       |
| 55:53      | Although it will have the default in that working sessions already. Yeah so changing                      |
| 56:07      | like whatever the active window is may end up being more work than                                        |
| 56:13      | clicking through but that's something to look at for sure. Well it's a worthy application for             |
| 56:21      | automation in that it does a very small amount of things and it does them very well and as we all         |
| 56:28      | know automation tools they're the big ones like [[Keyboard Maestro]] that can do 8,000 things and             |
| 56:34      | are amazing at them and then there's little ones like Moom or default folder X which do                   |
| 56:40      | one thing but they do it really well and that's you know both all of those tools are worthy of this.      |
| 56:48      | I don't think we've ever covered default folder X on this show and additional automation things           |
| 56:54      | you can do that like Kathy you would find very useful is every time you save a file it just               |
| 57:00      | gives you additional options like you can have a list of favourite folders and the recent folders          |
| 57:05      | you've been working in and just it just takes a lot of tedium out of saving files and you can             |
| 57:10      | apply tags right there I mean I know you can also do that in the default save dialog box but              |
| 57:16      | it does a does a real good job another thing I like about default folder X is it's been around            |
| 57:22      | forever I mean the reason it's called default folder X I believe it was on Mac I was on Mac OS            |
| 57:30      | before there was Mac OS 10 and I think I mean I can't remember if it came from next or it came from       |
| 57:36      | prior I think it came from prior Mac OS and they've just done a great job of keeping it up and            |
| 57:44      | modernise it the UI looks completely current looks like an app that was designed a week ago if            |
| 57:50      | you look at the UI they have it just like stuck around and but but even just I find it very useful        |
| 57:56      | when I'm saving and working with a lot of documents and when I think about your client work for instance  |
| 58:01      | you could have a lot of your client folders saved as favourite folders so every time you want to save      |
| 58:07      | something to a client folder you could just click a favourite instead of having to drill through your      |
| 58:12      | file system to get to it yeah it also has a recent folders as an option and for people                    |
| 58:18      | looking at the show notes there's two links to default folder X there one of them is on the               |
| 58:22      | Sinclair software website the other one is in setup so if you already pay for setup you get it free       |
| 58:28      | so uh you know it's worth giving it a try if you can get it for free right                                |

| 01:00:15   | So Kathy I'm guessing while you're doing these things you're not going to be sitting in silence           |
| 01:00:19   | and I may or may not have already looked at the show notes you know preparing for the podcast             |
| 01:00:24   | and I know that you have some magic to deal with music playlists so you know other than sitting           |
| 01:00:32   | there in silence there's there's options like music you know how do you do this what what what            |
| 01:00:37   | magic do you have for music. Yeah so this is specifically for when I'm out and about or                   |
| 01:00:46   | walking the dog or taking a shower and I have my phone with me I listen to music very specifically        |
| 01:00:56   | in that I will usually make playlists out of albums so that I can not listen to if there's                |
| 01:01:03   | any songs in an album that I don't want to listen to I don't have to have it in the playlist              |
| 01:01:10   | or if I want to listen to say both of Taylor Swift's folklore and evermore albums together                |
| 01:01:18   | I have a playlist with that and I was very disappointed and still am with the the apple                   |
| 01:01:27   | music widget items I want like recent stuff to be playlist and they but they don't have that as           |
| 01:01:38   | an option you have like specific albums but not the playlist to choose from and so I was                  |
| 01:01:46   | really really angry because it would keep showing like the Christmas album I listened to                  |
| 01:01:54   | and it's February and I'm like this is not this is not what I want and so I created my very first         |
| 01:02:02   | shortcut and I'm very proud of myself and [[Matthew Cassinelli]] was very proud of me too and that's          |
| 01:02:10   | really what matters but basically I have icons on my screen that show like an image from either music     |
| 01:02:23   | video or album or something for four specific items the one that we use most often is the                 |
| 01:02:30   | Hamilton soundtrack and it is on shuffle as well because when Avi and I are in the car                    |
| 01:02:40   | that is what we're listening to and it's always entertaining and fun to see what shuffle options          |
| 01:02:46   | are around but instead of having to ask Siri to play this playlist on shuffle we can just tap             |
| 01:02:54   | the picture on the home screen and poof it's magic I love that so have you have you got                   |
| 01:03:02   | Carplay or Bluetooth or something in your car where you could connect that to an automation               |
| 01:03:07   | so that when you pop when you get in your car it will just automatically do that for you                  |
| 01:03:12   | or is that maybe not an option yet um yes I have a Bluetooth connection thing in my car                   |
| 01:03:19   | because the only Bluetooth that it has is for a phone um because it's an older vehicle um but             |
| 01:03:27   | I don't necessarily want an automation in that because it's going to be different depending               |
| 01:03:33   | on why I'm going especially because we don't go a lot of places we don't go a lot do a lot of             |
| 01:03:40   | things um so it's a 50 50 chance on whether I want to listen to a podcast that I'm playing                |
| 01:03:48   | or the music with Avi mm-hmm yeah because uh the Bluetooth automation so I'm using this in                |
| 01:03:54   | my car as well and I've got um I've got I've got a cable in my car uh for this so it's actually           |
| 01:04:00   | it plugs in it plugs into uh the the charger that I put into the cigarette lighter my car is 10           |
| 01:04:05   | years old people it's okay um and then plugs from there into the aux port um and so this this means       |
| 01:04:11   | that when I turn the car on then theoretically the Bluetooth turns on however when you turn the car       |
| 01:04:15   | on that turns on the electrics including this charger um and the or the Bluetooth adapter                 |
| 01:04:21   | and then um when I actually turn on the engine it briefly turns off the electrics and then                |
| 01:04:27   | turns everything back on again uh so I get two pop-ups on my phone for the Bluetooth um notification      |
| 01:04:33   | there um to say would you like to run your automation which drives me more than a little bit              |
| 01:04:38   | insane um but uh it means that I get two opportunities to hit the button uh and run my                    |
| 01:04:44   | my car automation and like you I might listen to different things in the car so I have it show me a       |
| 01:04:49   | menu um of things so that then I can just go yeah this one or that one um I actually also                 |
| 01:04:55   | have another one which says nothing um and then that exits the shortcut um because it does a couple       |
| 01:05:01   | of other things as well um after choosing the music and so me tapping away from the menu will then        |
| 01:05:07   | make the rest of the shortcut not run and that's the bit that automatically sends a message to            |
| 01:05:11   | my parents if I'm going to be driving there or something like that so I like to uh make sure              |
| 01:05:15   | that that actually runs because otherwise I turn up at my parents place and they go                       |
| 01:05:19   | huh we didn't know you were coming it's like thanks lovely to see you too it's always good                |
| 01:05:24   | to feel welcome no my parents always like seeing me but I like to give them a heads up just so            |
| 01:05:30   | they've got 10 minutes notice um that you know I'm turning off because having somebody turn up on         |
| 01:05:35   | your doorstep unexpectedly can be nice uh but having it happen repeatedly can be                          |
| 01:05:39   | absolutely aggravating so I make sure to uh give them a heads up there um and I do this with the          |
| 01:05:44   | automation because Bluetooth automations can from shortcuts cannot run entirely automatically when        |
| 01:05:49   | you connect to a Bluetooth device the best it can do is show you a notification on your home screen       |
| 01:05:54   | to run something um but then you know if you're going to tap your home screen anyway then you can         |
| 01:05:59   | give yourself a menu and uh tap your home screen twice love it so Kathy as someone who doesn't            |
| 01:06:05   | spend a lot of time in shortcuts how did you find the experience of creating your in shortcut             |
| 01:06:09   | did did you use somebody else's or did you you build it from scratch I actually built it from             |
| 01:06:15   | scratch um which I'm very proud of myself um but it was fairly easy because it's it doesn't do a          |
| 01:06:26   | whole lot um so being able to go in and say you know play so I picked the music to play                   |
| 01:06:34   | and then you choose the playlist and done and then the the most complicated part was adding it to the     |
| 01:06:41   | home screen because I had to pick the perfect picture for it on the home screen um but other              |
| 01:06:49   | than that pretty easy uh nice and simple um use shortcuts it's great most important automation            |
| 01:06:59   | question of this entire show all right yes what is your favourite Hamilton track oh gosh                   |
| 01:07:07   | that is so rude how dare you sir um because there's no such thing as a favourite Hamilton track um         |
| 01:07:16   | we really enjoy singing along to Aaron Burser um and also uh satisfied and then of course any of          |
| 01:07:31   | King George is of course just delightful but because we've listened to it so many times um we             |
| 01:07:40   | sing full volume to every song that's playing so all of them is my final answer I I was just              |
| 01:07:48   | listening to it over the weekend the reason I asked and man I really like Farmer Refuted I know it's     |
| 01:07:53   | just a little like side little ditty in the musical but I just love the way that song is                  |
| 01:07:58   | structured it's so fun it's just yeah that's one of the best the best ones I'm guessing now is not        |
| 01:08:05   | a good time to tell the two of you though I've still not had a chance to actually watch it on             |
| 01:08:09   | Disney plus so I think I'm probably going to be given homework now to do that I literally drug            |
| 01:08:13   | you to the live performance of you did and I loved it it was great I show it in Chicago I think with      |
| 01:08:20   | you um I say with you it was one of those things where I got a last minute seat and you also had          |
| 01:08:25   | a last minute seat um and so we were sitting in two completely different places but you know we're        |
| 01:08:29   | in the same audience it was all good that's so fun all right I want to touch you Kathy we talked          |
| 01:08:35   | earlier about the the monster unicorn that is so on it and I know one of the things you do is text        |
| 01:08:42   | automation and primarily TextExpander I believe yes that's correct and they might be a sponsor of        |
| 01:08:50   | the show I'm not really clear yet I think smile sponsoring I don't know what product they're              |
| 01:08:53   | sponsoring but this is has nothing to do with that but I would like to hear how you're using it to        |
| 01:08:59   | to get your work done yeah so this is the perfect time for it because I don't know if you know            |
| 01:09:04   | but we are in the middle of tax season here in the United States today is tax day as we're recording      |
| 01:09:11   | this and one of my clients is a CPA and so I a lot of the work that I do for them is                      |
| 01:09:21   | client facing so the client communications are a big part of what I manage I just ran my report           |
| 01:09:30   | for the last month for a TextExpander and I saved 10 hours and 15 minutes in the last                    |
| 01:09:38   | month that's crazy working day and a quarter that is yeah incredible                                      |
| 01:09:45   | and so I'm using this to populate the messages that says hey we're done with your return this is          |
| 01:09:55   | how much you owe or this is how much your refund is and these are the next steps we need from you         |
| 01:10:00   | we always have to get a signature of course from them and so this letter that gets populated              |
| 01:10:07   | is in that signature form sent through the Docusign so it tells them where they can send their           |
| 01:10:15   | money to pay or if they want us to debit it they can let us know here's what you owe for estimated        |
| 01:10:22   | taxes or not and and all of that is just automatically input years ago I used to copy it from I had       |
| 01:10:32   | Evernote documents that I would click over command a command s or not command s command c then go         |
| 01:10:43   | back over command v and like copy and paste it from there and it's so much easier to just type            |
| 01:10:50   | the letters that I need to do it for but this also I am like the files that I'm sending get               |
| 01:11:01   | downloaded from the software that we use and the naming is very generic so I have to                      |
| 01:11:08   | change the name so that it's very specific to what this particular document is                            |
| 01:11:15   | is I also utilise it for any time somebody says hey I want yeah I'm interested in your                    |
| 01:11:24   | tax services I have a TextExpander that tells them what we're all about and where to sign up             |
| 01:11:32   | for an intro call etc so it's so helpful for every piece of this that I could not live without            |
| 01:11:44   | my tax expander snippets how are you renaming files sorry that that was the little bit that caught        |
| 01:11:50   | my attention there you know you said you know the software gets that you very generic file names and      |
| 01:11:55   | I have to admit generic file names are the bane of my existence especially for documents where            |
| 01:12:00   | for whatever reason the content just doesn't get you know parsed by spotlight and so therefore            |
| 01:12:05   | it's not searchable so how are you renaming documents right now yeah so when the file the                 |
| 01:12:12   | file comes down and it's just saved with their name right so it's you know smith comma john               |
| 01:12:19   | dot pdf so I have a TextExpander snippet that adds a space line space and then 2020 return               |
| 01:12:28   | so I click into the file name and hit the TextExpander so it fills it out fully and then we              |
| 01:12:35   | have the signature page that's also saved and so I copy the name that I just text expanded                |
| 01:12:42   | that has the full name and 2020 return and I save it into the other file and then I have a second         |
| 01:12:50   | TextExpander snippet that just says signatures and so I highlight the word return and do the        |
| 01:12:59   | TextExpander snippet so that it changes return to signatures and so I now have two files that                 |
| 01:13:07   | are named exactly what I needed to name it so that I can upload it to the client vault                    |
| 01:13:13   | not to bash on TextExpander here because that that's not what I'm doing but I wonder if maybe            |
| 01:13:19   | you might be slightly more efficient with any an automated droplet for this because then you              |
| 01:13:24   | could just drag and drop the file onto a thing and it would say hey so this is now called 2020            |
| 01:13:31   | returns or 2021 returns or whatever it is and then you drag the next file onto the next one               |
| 01:13:38   | and it takes maybe what's on your clipboard and then replaces the text and then renames the file          |
| 01:13:46   | to that just wondering I'm thinking out loud here of course you know I may I may be going totally         |
| 01:13:53   | off-piste but I'm just thinking how how can I potentially optimise the unicorn's workflow                 |
| 01:13:59   | and that is one of the things that I would be exploring for that for sure of course [[Hazel]]                 |
| 01:14:05   | could definitely do this as well it could say hey you know any file that was downloaded from              |
| 01:14:10   | this website you know rename it like this maybe you would want to use the tag trick again which           |
| 01:14:17   | says you know maybe just have a tag which says [[Hazel]] make magic happen or something and then              |
| 01:14:23   | you can tag files that appear in in whatever folder with that and then it looks for specific              |
| 01:14:27   | folders and then looks for anything with that tag so that it knows what to do because of course it        |
| 01:14:31   | can look at the contents of the file and this is all done locally on your machine so you don't need       |
| 01:14:35   | to worry about you know data being leaked across the internet which is you know related to client         |
| 01:14:40   | files right right the one concerning thing I have with that is the difference of like volume              |
| 01:14:50   | because um uh there's some days that I'll be doing you know 30 returns                                    |
| 01:14:58   | and how I don't know how that would interact with [[Hazel]] and like if I'm sitting and I'm doing you         |
| 01:15:08   | know a period of time for like multiple I would I have no doubt that it would work yeah it just           |
| 01:15:18   | is very concerning yes it's one of those things where if you automate it incorrectly you're going         |
| 01:15:24   | to be worried about you know it stuff is going to go wrong and it could go potentially very wrong         |
| 01:15:28   | and you could have um you know John Smith's information attached to Jane Doe's signature                  |
| 01:15:33   | form or something like that exactly and um I don't know if you know this but sending somebody             |
| 01:15:38   | the wrong tax documents I'm going to assume it's a bad thing uh you don't want to yeah yeah exactly       |
| 01:15:44   | yes yeah I mean yeah that is always the thing which is why I would probably personally be                 |
| 01:15:50   | looking at something like the automated droplet uh for this because then you drag you know your           |
| 01:15:55   | files onto that and it looks at that information and you know and and then it does those two files        |
| 01:16:01   | so it does John Smith's files um and you've seen them before you did the dragging so you know that        |
| 01:16:05   | they're John Smith's files and then you do Jane Doe's files and repeat and so on so you know you're       |
| 01:16:10   | still potentially going to be handling say 15 people um but then you just throw two files at it           |
| 01:16:16   | and it goes boom and and here here's the renamed files for you yes which would be I will uh add that      |
| 01:16:22   | to the list of uh things to discuss with the Rose agency well it's okay you're giving me homework         |
| 01:16:30   | too I have to watch Hamilton on Disney Plus now oh you poor thing I know it's so tragic I'm very          |
| 01:16:36   | upset one thing you talked about Kathy that struck my um that made me curious is the idea of copying      |
| 01:16:45   | and pasting and this removes that are are you using the um the paste buffer field in Texas                |
| 01:16:51   | Spender using a clipboard that's a no because I don't know what that is sure like one of the              |
| 01:16:58   | things you can do with Texas Spender and I think this might be helpful for you is um you can take         |
| 01:17:04   | the contents of the clipboard and paste them into a snippet as an example like I have um                  |
| 01:17:12   | one of my clients deals with a lot of government contracts and I have to send out these um legal          |
| 01:17:17   | documents related to those and the numbers are really long and I don't ever want to get one of            |
| 01:17:23   | them wrong so um what I did is I made a Texas Spender snippet and it as part of the Texas                 |
| 01:17:29   | Spender snippet if you look up in the toolbar in Texas Spender you can paste the contents of the          |
| 01:17:34   | clipboard so then before I use the snippet I just go to the source document and I copy the contract       |
| 01:17:41   | number and then I go ahead and put this put the snippet in my document and it paste the content           |
| 01:17:47   | so I don't have to copy and paste into the snippet if that makes sense kind of make sense um make a       |
| 01:17:58   | note of that Rose to review absolutely absolutely all I'm saying is that the snippet can automatically    |
| 01:18:05   | hit command v for you it's really good so like you can have you know in my case it's a government         |
| 01:18:12   | contract number and then I put a little token in the snippet that the Texas Spender has that hits         |
| 01:18:20   | command v and paste whatever is in the buffer and then finishes the snippet and I find that very          |
| 01:18:25   | useful another one another one that I use with Texas Spender for sending emails out to clients            |
| 01:18:31   | it sounds like you're doing that is you can hard code the tab key into the snippet so you could           |
| 01:18:38   | make a snippet that you trigger in the subject line so it could fill in the subject line of the           |
| 01:18:45   | email and then hit the tab key and then every email client what does the tab key do goes to the next      |
| 01:18:51   | field jumps to the body jumps to the body so if you trigger the snippet in the subject line               |
| 01:18:57   | it fills in the subject line and hits the tab key and then does the rest of the email for you so          |
| 01:19:02   | you don't have to do two snippets that's very cool the other thing that you could do I'm guessing         |
| 01:19:07   | you've written 2020 or 2021 the correct year in in your snippets the other thing you can do of course     |
| 01:19:15   | is Texas Spender has date snippets where you can just have it input the year either the current           |
| 01:19:21   | year or you could calculate back to the previous year which means that you know next year your            |
| 01:19:26   | snippets will be exactly the same you don't need to go in and change them but it'll just you know         |
| 01:19:31   | have the right year in magically and I have to say date snippets are one of the things I do love          |
| 01:19:37   | using the Texas Spender it works incredibly well for them I love uh specifically the the current dates um |
| 01:19:45   | a few other projects I I do I have like if I'm sending money to somebody and I have a spreadsheet         |
| 01:19:54   | that has the the the amount that I have to do and then there's the date sent field being able to just     |
| 01:20:01   | put in you know the snippet that I have for the number date and then I have for another spreadsheet       |
| 01:20:09   | like when I'm sending out invoices um it's the longer version so it has the word date in it um            |
| 01:20:18   | and so I just mentally those little snippets so I don't even have to think about the date anymore         |
| 01:20:23   | which is really great because what is time nobody knows what time is anymore no especially                |
| 01:20:27   | isn't it like March sometime I don't even know anymore I'm so used yeah it's always March yeah            |
| 01:20:33   | it's always been March for well over a year now and I'm I'm fine with that mostly yes                     |
| 01:20:40   | it's been March so long that it was March again and now it's March no longer                              |
| 01:20:45   | yeah that's it's heartbreaking is what that is yes but the good news is is the world is improving         |
| 01:20:52   | and our automations are improving along with it so uh I'm hoping that uh I've certainly stolen a          |
| 01:20:58   | couple of ideas from you so far Kathy I've got quite a few things um and I've also got many ideas         |
| 01:21:04   | running around to my brain I mean it's there is kind of like a cheerleading squad they're all             |
| 01:21:08   | competing to get to the top of the pyramid um so uh I'm hoping that uh at least one of those              |
| 01:21:13   | is going to make it and then I can get that's what Kathy needs and I can send it to you                   |
| 01:21:17   | I love it I'm so excited so excited I do feel like Kathy though you you know you've you figured           |
| 01:21:25   | out TextExpander and I think that's kind of the gateway drug of all this and then the next step          |
| 01:21:31   | after that is [[Hazel]] I feel like with all the file work you do if you spend a couple hours learning        |
| 01:21:38   | how [[Hazel]] works um it will change your game it will change your game yeah I'm I'm really I'm              |
| 01:21:44   | really excited uh to see how it can make me even more magical there you go there unicorns all use         |
| 01:21:52   | [[Hazel]] so you need to get on that train I'm on it I'm on it I uh clearly I'm not going to search           |
| 01:21:59   | for it now because I have a clicky keyboard that will make poor jam have to edit things out and I         |
| 01:22:07   | don't want to do that but it's on the list as soon as I tackle the seven [[Slack]] messages the 21 emails     |
| 01:22:14   | the four uh text messages and the three Facebook messenger messages too all right so Kathy where          |

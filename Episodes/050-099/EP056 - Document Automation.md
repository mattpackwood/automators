| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators. I'm David Sparks, and I'm joined by my co-host, or Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 00:07      | Hey, Rosemary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:08      | Hey, David. How are you today?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:10      | I am very pleased to be speaking with you because of our podcast recording schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:15      | It's been a few weeks, and I missed you, and I missed talking about automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:20      | Yeah, we should do that more. Wait, we have a podcast. Let's do it on the podcast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:24      | Yeah. Well, I've been, you and I have been talking, and we've been trading [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:28      | and other kind of nerdy stuff, but we haven't been on the mic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:31      | And this is an episode we had written down on our list early in the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:34      | We just never got to it till today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:36      | But yes, today we're going to talk about document, automation, and document templates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:41      | Aren't you excited?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:42      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:43      | Aren't you excited?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:44      | I'm so excited. This is such a theoretically boring and nerdy topic,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:47      | and we're going to have so much fun with it because there are just so many ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:51      | where you can get really automation crazy and nerdy and create great results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:57      | Yeah, I have a bit of an announcement before we get started though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01      | On August 27, I'm doing a webinar, first time I've ever done this, on [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:08      | Lately, I've been really changing my workflows for [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:12      | I've been working in context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:14      | So like when I want to work on MacSparky, [[Keyboard Maestro]] gives me those tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:18      | And when I want to work on the Mac, [[Keyboard Maestro]] gives us tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:21      | or want to work on the legal stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:23      | It's just kind of an extension of the way I've been doing shortcuts on my iPhone and iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:28      | And I'm really pleased with the way it's been working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:30      | I also wanted to share it with the folks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:32      | It's not just for field guide customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 01:41      | It's on August 27 at 10 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:43      | We're going to have a couple of special guests, at least one, one of which is Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:49      | I'm going to have to pull out a pillow, wrap it out of my hat and show off something fancy with [[Keyboard Maestro]] for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:55      | Yeah, it's going to be fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:56      | So I'm going to kind of talk through what I'm doing with context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:58      | Rose is going to do a little something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:00      | It will be added content to the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide when it's all done,                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:03      | but you can go in and watch it for free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:05      | So just go and do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:06      | Sign up for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:07      | Like I said, August 27 at 10 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 02:10      | In the past, I've done some of these things where we were limited to 100 people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:14      | That is no longer the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02:16      | I've written checks and now I can accommodate everybody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:19      | So go sign up, please, and we'll see you on the 27th.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 02:23      | But that's not why we're here today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:25      | We're here today to talk about documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:27      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:28      | And I mean, what kind of documents can we do this with?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:32      | Because I know most of the time when I do this, it's actually plain text, which sounds very strange,                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:38      | but it works for me and it works great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:41      | But what kind of stuff do you do, document, you know, template automation with David?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 02:45      | Yeah, I mean, the underlying problem is a lot of us use similar but not identical documents,                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 02:51      | whether you're in sales or I'm in law or whatever you do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:54      | You've got, you know, documents you use repeatedly, but things change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 02:59      | And as good automators, the question to us is how can we change them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 03:03      | And the problem gets more complex with the complexity of the document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 03:08      | Like plain text is the easy one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 03:10      | We're going to talk about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:11      | There's some really cool stuff you can do with templates and plain text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:14      | That's, I think, one of the reasons why Markdown is so good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 03:16      | And by the way, if you don't listen to Mac Power Users, we did a whole episode on Markdown recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 03:20      | You might want to go check that out if you're an automator fan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:23      | But so plain text is one solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:26      | Another document automation trick is the web, you know, doing stuff on the web.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:32      | And we got some ideas for that today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 03:34      | And I think the hardest one is formatted documents like Microsoft Word and pages and rich text documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 03:40      | Those are a little harder to automate, but we got some, we got some solutions for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 03:45      | We're going to drop some knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 03:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 03:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 03:48      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:49      | So let's start with the easier one, the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 03:52      | What are the problems you have with text and document automation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 03:56      | How are you solving them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 03:57      | Well, I mean, the most common use case, and I'm just going to say here, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:01      | my templates tend to be, you know, this thing has, you know, say, for example,                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 04:06      | we are doing an episode of automators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 04:10      | Now, of course, it doesn't mean that we scripted it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 04:12      | You know, we, we, we just have an outline, but we have certain stuff that has to go in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 04:16      | You know, if we have a guest on the show, we want to make sure the link is in there for them to upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:20      | But that means that I basically have to fill in the gaps, basically variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 04:26      | And so for me, most of the time, my biggest problem is getting those variables into whatever system it is that I'm using to automate.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:35      | Because sometimes I want to just type everything in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 04:38      | And other times I don't want to just type everything in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 04:41      | I want it to come from somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 04:43      | You know, maybe it's been parsed out of air table or maybe it's been sent via Zapier to push cut.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:48      | And then Pushcut, putting that into shortcuts for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:51      | And that can be a bit tricky to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:54      | Why don't we take on this show outline problem?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:57      | So that's a plain text to web doc, you know, document automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:02      | But when you and I decide to make a new episode of automators, we, you know, we get on the phone, we talk about potential guests and topics.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 05:10      | And then you have, I believe it's a Zapier automation that spits out an outline for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:17      | And that spits out an outline is a formatted Google doc just to give you a picture of the end goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 05:22      | So what we do, you know, aside from the talking, we also put all the data into air table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:27      | Because air table lets us go ahead and make sure that we've got all of the necessary fields filled in.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:33      | It's very easy to go through and see that there's a column missing here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:37      | And that would be something that then either we just need for reference purposes or it gets put into the document.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:43      | And then when we have enough fields filled in, in that particular row, it shows up in a view in air table and Zapier is watching this view.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:54      | And it looks at it and goes, oh, hey, there's something in this view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:57      | That means I need to go ahead and create an outline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:00      | And so that's how that Zapier automation works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:03      | And then it goes through and it pulls out data and it pulls out all of these different columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:08      | And inside of Zapier, I have a text action, which is just it's plain text, but it's marked down formatted.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:15      | And then I drop in in a lot of different places, these air table columns as variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 06:22      | And so this then produces a much more complex text, which has actually got everything in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:28      | So instead of it saying, hello, guest, it might say hello, David or hello, sell or hello, Tim, depending on who we're having on the show.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:35      | Yeah. So you're using variable fill in from an air table field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:40      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:41      | And I did go ahead and I'm using the scripting action to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:45      | I'm sure there's a much better way, but I'm using the scripting action with [[JavaScript]] to determine whether or not there's a guest.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 06:51      | And to set another variable based on whether or not we have a guest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:56      | And basically what this does is it sets the body of the document, the primary body of the document to one thing if we have a guest and something else if we don't have a guest.                                                                                                                            |
| 07:06      | So it means that then, you know, if we do have a guest, it has, you know, like a quick hello and a summary of how it's going to work and things that they need to bear in mind and where to upload the audio to.                                                                                           |
| 07:17      | And then if we don't have a guest, it gives us different text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:21      | Yeah, if we've got a guest, it gives them our cell phone numbers if they get, you know, stuck in traffic or whatever.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:26      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:27      | Important information like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 07:28      | What we'd call the content episodes where we don't have guests, the outline is a lot simpler.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:33      | Now, this isn't generating the actual text, the outline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:35      | For instance, today's episode when, when the script got done running, it didn't have all the points we're going to talk about.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:41      | But as, you know, the beginning, the ending and the point headings, you know, that we can start working from.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:48      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:49      | It's great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:51      | Now you also do some clever automation on this just to dive right into the deep end based on the episode number.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 07:58      | Because another trick of the automators is generally I do the intro and publish the even ones and Rose does the intro and publishes the odd ones.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:08      | Well, see, you think it's done on the episode number and I've managed to hoodwink you there.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:14      | So inside of our air table, originally I had it based on the episode number, but every so often for whatever reason, we do have to trade episodes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:22      | And we still try and keep, you know, the recording, you know, for as, as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:27      | But I have a responsible column in air table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:31      | And this links to a host overview page where we have helpful information about us, which also means that we know who, for example, who is the primary person who has talked to a specific guest or something.                                                                                              |
| 08:43      | And then that links to itself and it has a field called cohost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:48      | And so what it does is when, when it creates the new episode, it'll have something at the beginning like, hello, I'm David Sparks.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:54      | And it looks at that and then it checks the cohost field and goes, and I'm talking to Rosemary Orchard and that's all filled in through another table.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:02      | I did have it based on the episode number originally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:05      | Again, that was in [[JavaScript]], but it meant that when we traded off something, then one of us would have to manually go in and modify the outline, which will manual things turn out to happen or don't happen as expected.                                                                                |
| 09:17      | So I decided that I would much rather go ahead and just add an extra column here. You know, I didn't, you didn't notice it.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 09:25      | So I've been keeping on top of my work there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:28      | That's great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:31      | So, so Rose is using [[JavaScript]], [[Zapier]] and [[Google Docs]] to create an online automated document.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:37      | And we switched to [[Google Docs]] and it is there's think good, good and bad about that, but it does work very well with online automation tools.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 09:46      | Yeah, we were using [[Quip]] before and this worked really well with [[Quip]] too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 09:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:51      | So, but what I've done is when we switched from Quip to Google Docs, I only actually had to add one action inside of Zapier, which was to, to convert the Markdown HTML because Google Docs in Zapier cannot create a document from Markdown.                                                              |
| 10:10      | It can do it from plain text or can do it from HTML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10:12      | And so I said, well, if I convert the Markdown into HTML and then create the document with HTML, then we get a formatted document.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 10:19      | It's not as pretty as I would like. I've seen the Mac Power users outlines. They're lovely. They're beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10:24      | Steven Hackett has probably, you know, written sonnets about how lovely they are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:29      | This is just using the standard Google Docs templating, but it works pretty well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:33      | And I'm quite pleased with it because it means that our outlines magically appear in Google Docs where we can both see them.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 10:39      | And it gets added a link to it gets added back to the air table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10:43      | And I have been doing a little playing recently, David, of creating an email from air table with shortcuts that I can then send to our guests.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10:53      | Yeah, that'd be nice. An automated email to go out with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10:56      | So we kind of dove into the deep end there with web automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:00      | I want to back up and talk just about plain text automation for a little bit because that's something that is probably the most frequent use for document automation.                                                                                                                                      |
| 11:10      | And it's the easiest one, honestly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11:13      | If you want to do plain text, there's so many ways to do it. I thought we'd talk about platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11:19      | For me, the go to text automation tool is TextExpander on the Mac because TextExpander has the ability to do fill in fields, which are in essence variables.                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:32      | So you can very easily, if you write some text that you know you're going to be using repeatedly, you just create a new TextExpander snippet on that.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:41      | And then from there, once you're in the snippet, you can, you know, create the fill in fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:48      | And one of the things you can do with TextExpander that I think a lot of people don't realise is you can duplicate those variables.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11:54      | So like when you say variable is like name of client, you can then copy and paste that variable multiple times inside that TextExpander snippet.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:04      | So you don't have to create, if you have the client's name four times, you just put the variable in four places, you don't create four separate variables.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:13      | And you only have to type it once and as you type it the first time it fills in all four places.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:18      | I think that's a little bit of a power tip. I think people don't realise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12:22      | But, you know, text expansion with fill in fields is really great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12:28      | The other thing you can do with TextExpander that a lot of people I think don't take advantage of is you can also put in the date and the clipboard.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12:36      | So document automation gets really easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12:39      | A good example for me is as a lawyer, sometimes I have to send out what they call interrogatories.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12:46      | You know, there are fancy questions when we're, you know, fighting about something in court.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:51      | And often I'll have multiple questions about the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:56      | Like I get the example that always comes to my mind is recently I had a case involving a federal.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:03      | It was a fancy thing, but there was a long number string that was attached to a federal document that we needed to get details on.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:10      | So I just caught and I had nine of those documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 13:13      | So I just copied the long string number and then I had made a TextExpander snippet that had all nine questions and use the clipboard to fill in the number.                                                                                                                                               |
| 13:24      | So I would copy to the clipboard, then run the snippet once, then I'd copy it to the clipboard and run the snippet again.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13:31      | And at the end, I had like 81 questions and they all had the exact right number in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 13:37      | You know, the big thing of automation we talked about is not just speed, but accuracy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:41      | And so, you know, between the clipboard, the date snippet and the ability to do fill ins, TextExpander can do just about any kind of text automation you want.                                                                                                                                            |
| 13:53      | And it works on the Mac and iOS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:56      | If you're going to do it on iOS and you're going to use fill ins, you've got to run it from the TextExpander app.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:00      | You can't run it from the keyboard, but, you know, you just run it from the app and then you block and copy that text wherever you want to put it.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:07      | Yeah, TextExpander is great for things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:09      | I found because I use iOS so much that, you know, because you have to switch out to the app, I would forget and then I would type something and sit there for a couple of seconds and be like, what's happening here?                                                                                      |
| 14:20      | And then remember, but let's flip screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 14:23      | It works really well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 14:24      | And as you said, you know, the accuracy of these things, especially with what you were doing is really important.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 14:30      | And I find that for so many things, you know, if I need to ask questions about seven or eight different, you know, items, then it's much easier to copy that list of seven or eight items and have something just go through it and spit out those questions for me because then I know they're all right. |
| 14:46      | And I'm sure, especially with legal things, you know, if you make a mistake there, that other law is going to be all over it.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 14:51      | So you need to watch out for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:53      | They have, I mean, you hire somebody in the office to check a remember if the guy makes one mistake on the number, you say, no, we don't have any documents on that because that's not the document we're talking about.                                                                                   |
| 15:03      | You know, lawyers are horrible, but you can also do some of this on iOS and Mac now with [[Drafts]].                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:09      | And I find templating documents and [[Drafts]] to be really, it's really useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15:17      | Oh, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15:18      | I actually have quite a few templates and [[Drafts]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:20      | Now, I will note that most of mine are sort of project templates for OmniFocus, but I also have other things.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:27      | So for example, when I create screencast online shows, then I have a lot of templates that I insert into various documents.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:34      | So we have specific formats for things like show links and stuff like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:39      | And just being able to tap one button and have it pop up with the three fields that I need to fill in.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:44      | And then it spits it out in the exact right format every single time is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15:48      | Or another mini template that I use when I'm writing my my monthly magazine article for screencast online is I tap that and it inserts, you know, the exclamation mark, the square brackets,                                                                                                               |
| 16:02      | and then the open bracket and then the start of the link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16:05      | And I just have to paste the file name of the image and it and the cursor is already in the right place.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:11      | And then it has the closing bracket after that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:13      | And that's great for inserting images because they always start with the same URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 16:18      | And it was really great a couple of weeks ago when I was flying back from Austria on a plane writing the article because I hadn't actually uploaded the images yet.                                                                                                                                        |
| 16:25      | But I knew I was going to upload them and what they were going to be called.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:28      | So I could insert all of these links without having uploaded them and I landed uploaded the images, checked my preview and, you know, I was good to go.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:36      | And so I went from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16:37      | But it's very easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 16:39      | You know, you mentioned this on the last show, the insert text action is a great way to get started with that as an as, you know, an action step inside multiple actions,                                                                                                                                  |
| 16:49      | because then you can just insert tons of stuff and it really gets the ball rolling on templates.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16:54      | Now, are you doing the, you know, the proper where it prompts you for a variable name and you type it in, then it fills it into the template for you or are you just doing that manually?                                                                                                                  |
| 17:04      | I am doing that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 17:06      | So I have a couple of different actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17:09      | The one I'll put a link to in the show notes in my OmniFocus template Taskpaper action group.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17:16      | That one will go through and it finds every single variable that's surrounded with French quotation marks.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:21      | Of course, if you speak French and you usually write with French quotation marks, this would be logical for most French people.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17:27      | Then this may be less useful to you if you're writing prose with speech and quotations, but it goes through and finds them.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 17:34      | And I've modified that and I actually have different variables in some cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 17:39      | So sometimes I surround up with the double slashes just because that's very easy to type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:44      | And so I have a few different ones, but they all operate on exactly the same script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 17:48      | I want to talk about later characters to surround variables because that's something that I am rethinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:56      | But let's put a pin in that for later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17:59      | Now, I have never got to the point with [[Drafts]] where I'm doing the, it queries me to fill in a field.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:05      | I know there's scripts out there I could use to build one on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:08      | I just never got around to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:09      | The stuff I do in [[Drafts]] doesn't really need that amount of effort in it, but how are you doing that?                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:14      | I mean, is it a [[JavaScript]] action?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:16      | What is it that puts the query on the screen for people to fill in?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18:21      | So I'm using a custom [[JavaScript]] action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:24      | And I'm talking from memory at this precise moment in time and opening my action to try it and make sure I say everything right.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 18:32      | But basically what I do is it finds all of the variables first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 18:37      | So the script goes through and it looks using a regular expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18:40      | We did a show on regular expressions a while ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:42      | And it looks for all of the variables which are surrounded in these quotation marks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 18:48      | And it pops up some other stuff before this and it asks me, you know, if I'm going to put this here or there.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:53      | But that, you know, that's not what we're after here today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18:56      | And then it adds this to a list of placeholders for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:00      | And then it actually creates a prompt for every single one of these placeholders or variables as we're calling them today.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 19:08      | And pops up and says, hey, what is your and then shows me the name of the thing inside of the the quotation marks.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19:16      | And that works really well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:19      | What I'm also experimenting with at the moment is another one where it just pops up the one single prompt, which has all of the variables in this has benefits and disadvantages.                                                                                                                          |
| 19:33      | So sometimes it's really useful to be able to see things, you know, like due date and defer date would be a classic example for me in one of my templates of, you know, two things I need to fill out because when I'm filling them out, I can look at the same time.                                      |
| 19:46      | But sometimes it's also more useful to see that to have things update in the background as I do things.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:54      | Now it depends on which script I'm using as to whether or not the whole template will update in the background as I go through and fill in the variables.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 20:02      | But it works quite well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 20:05      | Yeah, I think the problem you're describing is something I deal with the keyboard master all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20:10      | Like sometimes you'll have an issue where one variable gets repeated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:15      | A good example for me is when I'm working on corporate documents often the primary shareholder is also the company president.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:22      | I represent a lot of small companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:24      | So if I do the variable entry all at once, I have to type that person's name twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:29      | If I have it first query, who's the primary shareholder and then later it'll say who's the president.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:34      | It can say, do you want to be Joe Smith, you know, the person you just wrote down?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:38      | You know, I can do that through a [[Keyboard Maestro]], but you can do the same thing through [[JavaScript]].                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:43      | Now, is this [[JavaScript]] for people who like me are barely competent in [[JavaScript]] or people who are listening who don't even know how to do [[JavaScript]]?                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:53      | Is this something they could modify on their own or is this something where you get to have a pretty high level of expertise with [[JavaScript]] to change?                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:01      | Well, the example that's in my OmniFocus Taskpaper action group is a bit more complex because it's got some extra things running around.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:12      | But what I'm going to try and do by the time the show releases is have another [[Drafts]] action in the show notes for everybody where there is a simplified version                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:21      | that will just create a new draft from the draft that you're currently in with all of the variables filled out                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21:26      | and open that for you because that will be easier to see and understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:31      | So I will put that note in my OmniFocus and make sure that it's done by the time the show goes out if I can.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 21:38      | Great. I think that'll be helpful for folks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 21:41      | I do think document automation in [[Drafts]] is something to look at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:45      | Now, the way I do it isn't as fancy as Rose, but I don't have any templates in [[Drafts]] at this point that justify it.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:51      | I do all that stuff in TextExpander.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:54      | Even I will activate the TextExpander in [[Drafts]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:58      | But to be honest, almost all of my heavy duty writing takes place on a Mac anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:03      | So it's just not a problem I bumped into yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:06      | But there we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:09      | So we'll cover that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 22:21      | If you haven't checked out PDFpen lately, it's time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:24      | Version 12 is a major upgrade from the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:27      | You can now add page labels and multiple formats for documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22:30      | Take advantage of new stationery and customise your page designs and zoom up to 2000% with the new magnifier window.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:38      | So you can really get in there and get the details exactly right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 22:42      | And even optimise your PDF file size as much or as little as needed with options for colour, grayscale, or monochrome images.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:50      | And the ability to remove third party metadata to compress documents for sharing, storing or archiving, all while retaining quality.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:59      | And all that comes standard in PDFpen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:02      | PDFpen Pro takes it even further to allow you to seamlessly use DocuSign to sign or send documents easily and securely.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 23:21      | I was just using PDFpen on my Mac the other day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:24      | I had a long document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:26      | It was something I was using on the legal side and I had put a bunch of bookmarks in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:30      | So the whole thing was indexed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 23:32      | Later, I was on my iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:33      | I opened up PDFpen and all my bookmarks were there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:36      | It was just magic, you know, came right over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 23:38      | So I was able to take advantage of all that work I did on the Mac right over on the iPhone and iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:43      | It's a great app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 23:44      | I use it all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:45      | Now, if you do any work with PDFs, you need PDFpen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:48      | Go to smilesoftware.com/podcast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:52      | That's once again, that smilesoftware.com/podcast, P-O-D-C-A-S-T and let them know you heard about it on the automators.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 23:59      | Our thanks to PDFpen for their support of this show and RelayFM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:03      | So we've talked about the plain text side of things, which of course is a great place to start because it's nice and simple.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 24:10      | And even if you add markdown, you know, there's not a huge amount that can go wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 24:15      | But where I like to have a little bit more fun and, you know, make sure that more things can go wrong,                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 24:19      | as is always the benefit of any automation, is with word processing type documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 24:25      | So that's the sort of thing that you'd have like in pages or maybe even word or something afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 24:31      | And I don't do so much of this, but I know, David, you do a lot of this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:37      | And I was wondering how you do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:39      | Yeah, I work in, you know, one half of my career is in the business where we still use word processors all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 24:46      | So this is an issue I'm always looking to automate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 24:49      | It goes back a long way for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:51      | I used to write automations for Microsoft Word and word basic, which was like a basic programming language                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 24:57      | Microsoft made for Word ages ago and doesn't support anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:01      | And actually I had some pretty good forms in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:03      | But I've been looking for ways to automate Word and pages now for several years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:09      | I've tried it with AppleScripts and just lots of like scripting tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:14      | And I've finally kind of got myself to a happy place with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:18      | But I thought what I would do is kind of talk this through an order of complexity,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:23      | because you don't have to go all the way down the rabbit hole like I have to still get some good automation in your documents.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 25:30      | And the easiest way to start with that is just what we call a template document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:35      | In fact, Microsoft Word and pages have templates built right in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:38      | So you could make the perfect letter, perfect sales proposal and save that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:44      | And then you could come back and fill it in later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:48      | And the way a lot of people do this, and I think this is kind of the most basic is,                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:52      | I call it kind of like underline templates where they have a template that says deer and they have an underline.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:57      | Or, you know, they have a slot for the date and they have an underline for the date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:02      | And the idea is that you go through it and you just look for each instance of that kind of that underline                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:10      | or asterisks or whatever character you use to recognise something that needs to be filled in.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 26:14      | And you just manually type it in from top to bottom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:17      | And when you get to the end, you've got the document prepared off a template.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 26:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:21      | And that's what I do a lot of as well, because it works very nicely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:25      | It's quite simple to get started with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:27      | Yeah, it's super easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:29      | Anybody can do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:30      | And it's a nice upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 26:31      | So if you have template documents, why not put some character string?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:35      | Like, I would recommend something that is unique like for asterisks or for dollar signs or, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:43      | just pick some oddball character and then you can do a search in the document for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:48      | I would not recommend underlines because they're a pain to remove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:52      | And if you have a shorter character strings, you know, three, you know, I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:58      | It's easy to oversee things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 27:03      | And so you go and you select those three and you can just overwrite them with whatever it is that you need to fill in.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:09      | And then at the end, you do one last search for three pound signs together and make sure you found them all.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 27:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 27:15      | That's good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 27:16      | And that's kind of the first level of this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 27:19      | And a lot of people, that's enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 27:21      | And there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:22      | Word processing automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 27:24      | The next level up to that, however, is to create variables instead of having just the three pound signs.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 27:32      | You have two pound signs or four pound signs with two on each side and a word in the middle like date or client name or, you know,                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:42      | widget description or whatever it is that you need to fill in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27:45      | So rather than having the same, you know, wildcard throughout the document, you have separate wildcards for each of what I'll call for lack of a better term of variable that you want to replace in the document.                                                                                         |
| 27:59      | This is, you know, the next level up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:01      | A lot of people do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 28:03      | And it's really useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:05      | I think this is, you know, for your money, much more useful than the first version I talked about, you know, the simple template without variables.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 28:15      | The way I would recommend you do this is once you start creating the variables, you either go to the top or the bottom of the document and you create that list of variables.                                                                                                                              |
| 28:25      | So if you're going to have one for date and you put it, you know, it's, let's say it's in the letter and you've got the date variable at the top of the letter and maybe inside the letter somewhere that you can use the date.                                                                            |
| 28:36      | You go to the very top of the document or the very bottom and you also put the variable for date there too.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 28:41      | And the idea is you collect these variables in a single place because it's easy to miss them if you don't have them in a single place.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 28:49      | So let's say at the top of the document, you've got one that says, you know, pound, pound, date, pound, pound, then the next line says pound, pound, client, pound, pound.                                                                                                                                 |
| 28:57      | And so let's say you got 10 of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:59      | They're all at the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:00      | When you open the template document, you can just do a search and replace for each one of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 29:06      | And to get even fancier, you select the line, copy the variable, then you paste it in the find and then type in the replace.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:14      | And then you say replace all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:16      | That is a great way of doing it. And I personally am all in favor of adding that extra context.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:23      | So as you said, like pound, pound, date, pound, pound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:25      | Now, when you say pound, I assume that you mean the Great British pound symbol rather than the hash symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:30      | Right, David?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:31      | I meant the hash symbol, but you know, whatever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 29:33      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:34      | You've let down the side there, but that's okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 29:36      | I'll let you redeem yourself later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:38      | But yeah, but doing this really helps because then when you have that list of variables, then you know what that is for.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:46      | Now, of course, you could do pound, pound, one, pound, pound, two and put it in a table and then you, you know, add in the next column what it's for.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:54      | But you're actually creating a lot of extra work for yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:57      | And especially if at some point you started out and things were numerical orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30:01      | So the very first variable was the first in your list was the first one to appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:05      | And then you rearrange things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30:08      | It's much more difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:09      | And also just when you're looking at the document as a whole and you're trying to find a mistake, it's a lot more difficult to see if you've got something that's contextless in there.                                                                                                                    |
| 30:18      | Whereas if you've got, you know, pound, pound, you know, attorney, pound, pound, then you would know that, okay, this probably needs to be filled with the name David Sparks.                                                                                                                              |
| 30:27      | If you're looking at it as a manual thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30:30      | So let's talk about what symbols we use on either side of those variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:34      | So when I started doing this, like maybe 30 years ago, I am, I use the asterisk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:42      | And so I've got hundreds of things I've created over the years with asterisks in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:47      | But, you know, in the meantime, I became a Markdown fanatic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30:50      | And anytime I want to go and edit any of this stuff in plain text, the formatting goes, you know, it goes kablooey because it Markdown is looking for bold everywhere.                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:59      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:00      | Yeah, yeah, that's the Markdown symbol for pulled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:04      | So I really wish I didn't use pound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:07      | Recently, I thought, well, I'll use caret, you know, I don't know what you call it in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:11      | Is the caret the shift six? Is that a caret or is that the up the arrow?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31:14      | Yeah, that's a carrot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:16      | A good, good day, sir, carrot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:17      | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:18      | Maybe you guys have something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:19      | It's actually a French accent, but okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:21      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:22      | So I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:23      | Anyway, however, to my chagrin, I discovered that Microsoft Word does not like two carrots together.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:29      | It actually breaks Microsoft Word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:31      | It just doesn't do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:33      | So, so don't use carrots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31:35      | Well, the other thing is the carrot appears in regular expressions, which is something else you might want to take into account.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:41      | Now you've been using the example of using two of these and I am all in favor of two or three symbols before you do one of this kind of variable because it's much more difficult to accidentally type two or three.                                                                                       |
| 31:54      | And if you pick something like for example, the dollar sign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 31:59      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 32:00      | If you have two dollar signs together, that is not going to be a dollar plus something else that is going to be a variable.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:06      | But if you have one dollar sign, then that might be the something that was $13.99.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:10      | And if you have dollar one is a variable name and you're sending out a pre-prepared document template that is an invoice and something in there is $199.99.                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:19      | And you replace dollar one with David Sparks, then you're sending out an invoice for David Sparks $199.99.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:25      | And as far as I'm aware, David, you're not yet your own currency or has it changed recently?                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:30      | No, I don't think I ever will be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:32      | I think that that ship has sailed for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:36      | Well, you know, there's always tomorrow, you know, never say never.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 32:40      | So I really like the idea of French quotes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:43      | I mean, I like them too, but they're a bit difficult to type on iOS and that's something that I always like to keep in mind.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:49      | What character can I really easily type without thinking?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:53      | And so for me, the Ford and the backslash symbols are definitely where it's at because I can type those without the shift key when I've got a physical keyboard.                                                                                                                                           |
| 33:03      | It is a bit trickier on iOS when I'm using a software keyboard, but [[Drafts]] actions to the rescue when I'm on iOS again.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:10      | I have a custom keyboard row, the row that appears or it's an action group that I use above the keyboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 33:18      | And it lets me easily insert things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:21      | And the other advantage for me is the double slash in code languages is generally considered the start of a comment line.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 33:31      | So for me, that's automatically like note to self.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 33:34      | So I like double forward slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:37      | But sometimes depending on the document, I have been known to do double forward slash start variable and double backslash at the end of a variable.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 33:44      | Now, see, I don't see why you need to do backslash at the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:47      | You could do two forward slashes on either end and then you can avoid that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:52      | Well, the reason why I like to enclose a variable so that would mean having something at the start and something at the end is because what, for example, if so say, for example, I have attorney as a variable and attorney at law as a variable.                                                         |
| 34:06      | Now, I'm just picking out two completely random things based on stuff that I've been dealing with today.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:10      | In case you can't tell, I'm attempting to buy a house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34:14      | But these, you know, these two things pop up, but I need to fill them with different information.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:18      | If I just have slash slash attorney, then attorney at law is going to not is going to be replaced with whatever slash slash attorney is.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:26      | And that might not be the same information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:29      | All right, but you could do so the way I would do that is I would have slash slash attorney slash slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:36      | And then I would have slash slash attorney at law slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:38      | But if it's a pain in the neck to get the backslash, I would use the forward slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 34:42      | I don't like backslash and forward slash are both, you know, the one key on the keyboard, no shift key required, at least American layout.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:49      | If memory serves the same British layout, I don't have a British keyboard at hand at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34:53      | It's somewhere in the back of a wardrobe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34:55      | But I like using different symbols, because then I know that it's not the start of another variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:03      | Now, it's unlikely that I will be using two variables adjacent to each other, except where I've got maybe got something like due date and due time in say an OmniFocus task project template,                                                                                                              |
| 35:15      | which is maybe it's not a document template, but I consider a document template because it's one of my most frequently used ones or my most frequently used type of document template.                                                                                                                     |
| 35:24      | But it works well for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35:27      | And that's kind of the programmer and you coming out too, honestly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 35:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 35:31      | Well, the other thing is with regular expressions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35:34      | I mentioned this briefly before, but if in a regular expression you look for something that starts and then continuing on, you need a continuing on until, because otherwise you're going to go to the end of your document.                                                                               |
| 35:46      | And so for me, I very much like to have an explicit end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:50      | This is the end of my thing so that I know where I'm starting and where I'm stopping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 35:54      | I was thinking about this before we recorded it, and I was thinking I might just start using the pipe, you know, the straight up and down.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:01      | That's easy to access on the iOS keyboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:04      | It requires a shift on the Mac keyboard, but it's not that big of a deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:08      | And I kind of like the way it looks, because I think when you look at a document, those pipes will really stand out for the variables as you look across the document.                                                                                                                                     |
| 36:16      | So that may be the way I go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:18      | The only thing I'm going to say there, David, you like Markdown, pipes are used in Markdown tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36:22      | That's true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:24      | I'm not trying to scupper all of your otherwise brilliantly laid plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:28      | I'm just pointing out the pitfall for our listeners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:32      | One of the problems for me is that, you know, the stuff I'm doing right now breaks in Markdown, so I don't want any Markdown.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:38      | I rarely make Markdown tables, but you're right, that does show up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36:42      | I mean, it's forward slash, okay, and I like that because it's the comment thing, but unlike you, Rose, I think I'm just going to use forward slash on both ends.                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:49      | So I'm glad we were able to work that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:52      | Well, I'm glad too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36:53      | I mean, it really depends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:55      | I've got a couple of different things running around, and at some point, I really ought to just consolidate what I'm doing and be consistent everywhere,                                                                                                                                                   |
| 37:02      | but at the same time, there's no fun in that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 37:04      | So, you know, let's be inconsistent and continue to have automation literary fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:08      | Yeah, and the fact is all the scripts I've already written with the asterisks, I'm not going to go back and change them unless I have a really good reason to.                                                                                                                                             |
| 37:15      | So that's still going to be my life for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 37:19      | But anyway, so that's the second really way of doing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 37:22      | This is also simple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:24      | It gets better accuracy because you're typing the variable once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:28      | I think for very low investment, just taking the time to write those variable names in, I think that is totally worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37:37      | And and you're going to be happy with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37:40      | The downside to that is it's still a lot of work at the end, you know, when you have to run it and manually type them in.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37:46      | And it's a very easy to overwrite the template with these problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:50      | You know, I mean, I recommend you generate them as template documents within Word and pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 37:57      | If you if you just have a folder and you open it, you are eventually going to forget and then you're going to overwrite the template with variables and then you've got to go                                                                                                                              |
| 38:05      | unwind it all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:07      | Definitely. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:08      | That is going to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:09      | And I say that as the voice of somebody who has done this exact thing many, many times to herself.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 38:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:15      | Not that I've ever done this, but if I had done it, what I would do is immediately duplicate the one that I filled in and then go back to the original and hit command Z like 100 times and that would restore the template.                                                                               |
| 38:28      | But not that I've ever done it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 38:30      | That is exactly what I would do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:32      | Or time machine backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 38:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:35      | And then we get to and that's where I should have stopped Rose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 38:39      | I mean, that's a great way to automate documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:41      | It's not super nerdy, but it's fast and easy, but I wanted something better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:46      | And so over the years, this is where I ran into the AppleScripts and the various methods I've been trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 38:52      | And I've always been really doing these on Mac.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 38:54      | And the solution I've come up with is [[Keyboard Maestro]] automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:00      | I've got full videos on these in the [[Keyboard Maestro]] field guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:04      | I'll figure out something I can share when the show publishes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:07      | But the way you do it is your UI scripting [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 39:13      | And I, what I do is I open a template version of the document and then I have [[Keyboard Maestro]] pause.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:21      | There's so many pauses in these scripts because search and replace is a time intensive thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39:26      | And if you run these scripts without pauses, they won't work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39:30      | It will just, it'll crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 39:32      | But you pause and then you hit the keyboard combination for save as.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:37      | And fortunately with pages and word, when you save as it puts the cursor in the save field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:43      | So then you grab the variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:46      | I guess I got ahead of myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:47      | So the first thing that script does is it prompts you to insert variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 39:51      | What's the name?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:52      | What's the company name?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 39:53      | What's the date?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:54      | And, and with [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can automate a bunch of that stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 39:57      | Like you can put the date in automatically, you know, use today's date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 40:00      | And if you run the variable input script a couple of times, you can, you can use a previously entered variable like I was talking about earlier in the show.                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:09      | But once you've collected those, then you run the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:13      | First thing you do is you open the template, then you make a copy of the template and insert the name using the variables.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:19      | So if it's the ACME company shareholder meeting, I will type in the ACME company name from the variable and the shareholder meeting name will already be there.                                                                                                                                            |
| 40:28      | So it just saves a copy of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 40:31      | And then it just follows in the application, the keyboard strokes you would use to search and replace, you know, in pages, it's command F.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:42      | So you just hit command F and then you, you literally hit the tabs and type in the variable name that you hit a tab key and you type in the, the actual variable text.                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:54      | So the variable name may be slash slash company slash slash and the company name will be the ACME company.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:02      | And then it goes through and does a search and replace for those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:06      | And, you know, that's, it's not rocket science, but it works and you've just got to put plenty of pauses in and let it kind of do its thing and get through the document.                                                                                                                                  |
| 41:16      | And one of the, the tricks to this is once you've done it for one document, you can do it for 10 documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 41:23      | So like if I'm doing a company thing as a lawyer and there's five documents related to a shareholder meeting, I only have to type in the variables once.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:31      | And then once it finishes, you know, all the search and replace it hits command S, which is save and it pauses for like two seconds.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 41:39      | Then it goes and opens another template and it does the same thing using the variables I've already typed in.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 41:45      | And it's not immediate, but the whole thing happens within a few minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 41:50      | It's kind of fun to watch your computer just go off and generate documents for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:55      | And I find it really useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 41:57      | So one of the things you can run into trouble with this because your UI scripting, the UI has to be what the automation expects with the pages document, the state of the find box.                                                                                                                        |
| 42:09      | It remembers that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:10      | So it could either be find and replace or there's like a disclosure error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 42:14      | If you click that, it's just find.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:16      | But the last time you did it, you just left it on find.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:18      | You didn't turn it to find and replace the script will break because it doesn't have a replace field to find, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:24      | So there's all sorts of ways things can break, you know, but if you just kind of, you know, learn the ropes and you build these grips, it's pretty impressive to sit here and watch it generate a bunch of documents for you.                                                                              |
| 42:36      | I mean, you can always add an if to say if it finds the disclosure arrow in the up position on the screen, then it should click it and pause for a second and then continue.                                                                                                                               |
| 42:46      | But yeah, I see where that could break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:49      | There's another thing that we haven't actually talked about yet, which is under at least in pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:54      | I know it exists in Word as well, but under the format advanced menu, you can define text or a media as placeholders, which means that when you open a template, then you just sort of you click at whatever the field is and then you type and it fills it out.                                           |
| 43:08      | Now this, you know, doesn't have the amazingness of the cable maestro where you can fill out multiple documents, but especially if you're preparing templates that you're going to be using or giving to other people.                                                                                     |
| 43:18      | It's a very end user friendly way of doing things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 43:21      | And I'm all for end user friendly ways of doing things because every so often I have actually quite a few templates with that sort of thing in it because I don't use them very often.                                                                                                                     |
| 43:31      | But when I need to fill things out and send them, you know, it's great to just open it up and it's like, okay, blue field, blue field, blue field, blue field, blue field, no more blue fields, save done.                                                                                                       |
| 43:40      | And that works great for things like that. Now where that really doesn't work very well is if you need to input the same data in multiple places.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:48      | That is where something with the find or replace is going to be much nicer because it's, you know, it's designed to really, you know, the find and replace solution will find every single instance of this and replace it.                                                                                |
| 44:00      | Instead of you having to type Una Semper eight thousand and one 8001 times because Una Semper's name appears in the document 8001 times.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:07      | Yeah. And that is, that's the reason why I rarely use that feature because I most always have multiple instances of the same variable.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 44:15      | And yeah, and it just drives me crazy. And then then you lose the accuracy element of automation because you're typing the same name 10 times, you may have got it wrong once.                                                                                                                             |
| 44:25      | Yes. And then you send something to Una Semper instead of Una.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:30      | And, you know, then, you know, everything falls apart and there's no legal case anymore because there's no person of that name at this address.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:37      | Now with Word, it's even more tricky. I think shift command H is the find search and replace command to open find and replace.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 44:45      | But Word does not, the replace all doesn't work the same in Word.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:51      | So you have to literally run the command as many times as you want to do search and replace.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:56      | However, I've found that if you run it more than the minimum number of times, it doesn't cause a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:01      | So you just have it run 100 times for every single variable?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 45:04      | Like 20 times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 45:05      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:06      | Yeah. And if it's one that I know, there's only a few instances, I'll cut it down to three or four, but I will run it multiple times.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:14      | And it's just like all of these are hacks, but they work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:17      | Yeah. I mean, that's the thing, right? If it works, then it's not really a hack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:22      | It's just, you know, something that gets the job done. And there's no shame in having a bit of duct tape in your life as long as it gets the job done.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:29      | But for what I find, you know, that very useful is transactions involving multiple documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 45:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:37      | And I don't know that a lot of people listening to this are even going to need that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:40      | But if you want to, that's where you go with it to [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:43      | And I can tell you, I've tried everything else and none of them really worked very well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 45:47      | If it's just a one off document, it's literally just as fast to have a template document and do that and not even bother with making the [[Keyboard Maestro]] script,                                                                                                                                          |
| 45:55      | because you're just going to type the name and insert and search and replace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 46:00      | So maybe a few less mouse clicks with [[Keyboard Maestro]], but for one document, the payoff isn't worth the investment.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:07      | Makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 46:08      | You could also throw money at the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:10      | There's a great app called Hot Docs. Lawyers love that and it creates, generates documents with search and replace for you and has many, many tools and goes much deeper.                                                                                                                                  |
| 46:20      | And DocuSign is another one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 46:22      | There's several online document signing services, but DocuSign has a fill in format too as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:28      | If you've got stuff you want other people to sign for you, I would recommend doing that automation from inside DocuSign.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 46:35      | Some strange problems with search and replace that you may run into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46:39      | His and her, you know, what is the, you know, what is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 46:44      | And if you have a long document and you have, you know, his versus her, you can create variables for that, but it's also got to be he versus she and, you know, every iteration of that.                                                                                                                   |
| 46:57      | But you can do that in a variable and search and replace it to fix it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 47:02      | You know, verb tenses, singular and plural, stuff like that can often run into a problem if you get too fancy with your document.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:10      | And I've made very complex templates that try to solve all those problems and they never really work.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 47:16      | My advice is get the basic template made and then read the document and fix what you need to fix, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 47:23      | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:25      | If you're having an assistant comes in handy because you can hand something that you've already done off to an assistant and have them double check and say, hey, it looks like you've mixed this up here or something over there and it doesn't quite work.                                               |
| 47:38      | Or you can go ahead and just have Siri or whichever voice assistant you're preferring today, read the whole thing out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 47:45      | I find that's often a good way of catching these things, but it's not as automated as I would love.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:50      | Except my pages are, my documents are like 30 pages long. I don't have the pages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:54      | You're gonna do that. You could take a great nap while listening to your documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:57      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 47:58      | It's like my dad, he watches TV with his eyes closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 48:02      | This episode of Automated is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 48:05      | ExpressVPN lets you access the internet as if you're from a different country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:08      | Netflix has different shows and movies available depending on where you are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 48:12      | And with ExpressVPN, you can unlock thousands of new shows and movies from streaming libraries around the world.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 48:18      | There are hundreds of VPNs out there, but ExpressVPN is ridiculously fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 48:22      | You can stream everything in HD quality with zero buffering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 48:25      | And ExpressVPN is available on every device, phones, laptops, tablets, even your TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 48:31      | ExpressVPN works with many streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, BBC iPlayer, YouTube, and many more.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:38      | And you can choose from almost 100 different countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 48:41      | It's so simple to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 48:42      | Just fire up the ExpressVPN app, change your location, hit connect, and then refresh the page and the show or movie you want to watch will magically appear.                                                                                                                                               |
| 48:51      | Personally, I've been using ExpressVPN a lot recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 48:54      | Having recently moved countries, there's stuff that I can't get at in one country that I need to be able to access.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 48:59      | So for example, my Austrian bank for some reason wouldn't let me access their web page from the UK for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49:04      | I contacted their support and they said, it's a security problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 49:07      | You shouldn't be outside of Austria when you need to check your own bank account information.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 49:11      | To which I said, okay, I'll ExpressVPN it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 49:14      | And I've also used ExpressVPN to make sure that I stayed up on top of my Netflix watching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 49:19      | Glee for some reason didn't show up as available over here on Netflix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 49:23      | And now it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49:24      | But to start with, I had to ExpressVPN that too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 49:44      | All right, Rose, we've had a couple questions from listeners about problems they're trying to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 49:52      | We have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 49:53      | And one of them is something that I've also personally been struggling with, but I've been struggling with it for a different reason,                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 49:59      | which is stacking shortcuts widgets on iOS 14.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 50:03      | Now, I should start this by saying iOS 14 is in beta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 50:07      | Betas can be unstable, some less stable than others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 50:11      | I've had some interesting missing keyboard issues this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 50:15      | So if it's not working for you or you can't stack the really large widget on iOS 14, it's not you, it's iOS 14.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 50:24      | But stacking iOS 14 shortcuts widgets is something that is an amazing thing to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 50:30      | And have you done it, David?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 50:32      | How many shortcuts widgets do you have stacked right now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:34      | Yeah, I feel like now it's the challenge, like how many, how few shortcuts can you get away with?                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 50:41      | Historically, I have, like I've done videos on, you know, a whole home screen full of shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:46      | And I'm not doing that with a new thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:50      | And iOS 14's not out yet, but you and I are both on the beta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 50:53      | I will second your keyboard problem, by the way, my keyboard disappears during beta 4 right now,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:59      | which is kind of fun, like you're in the middle of typing like a [[Day One]] entry in the keyboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51:03      | It's always a share sheet and like notification responses for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 51:07      | So I can type like 15 characters and then it goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 51:11      | I should know I've submitted beta feedback on this and everybody who experiences this, please also submit feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 51:17      | The more feedback they get, the higher they prioritise these things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 51:20      | So the more likely it is, it's going to get fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 51:22      | I'm sure [[Apple]] are going to fix it, but please follow your feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 51:25      | I'm pretty sure the fact that the keyboard drops off the screen is something that they're going to take some time to figure that out.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 51:32      | I really hope so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 51:35      | Beta 4 has been the roughest of the betas in this year, but I'm sure they'll get it sorted out.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51:41      | But this is an interesting question though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 51:44      | Like for me, what I'm going to right now, what I've been doing with my home screen with the beta is I've got one large component that shows today's calendar.                                                                                                                                              |
| 51:56      | We talked about on this show last year when they had the potential of making a shortcut to show a screenshot.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:03      | If you change the screenshot, what if we designed a shortcut that put your calendar into a large view, turn that into a screenshot every morning,                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:13      | and then put it on the background of your desktop or your home screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:18      | So the idea being, let's build a home screen that shows my daily calendar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:22      | Well, now you can do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:24      | If you're not a shortcut, it's actually just a calendar element that you put.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:27      | If you put the large one in, it looks great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 52:29      | It shows your daily calendar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:30      | I really love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:32      | And I'm sure that like when Fantastic Ale gets their version of which it's out, it's going to be even better.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:37      | So that's cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 52:39      | And then I just kind of for completion, I also put a large photos element on that same one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:47      | And I don't have it automatically choose for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 52:50      | It shows the calendar, but if I'm in the mood, I'll just flip it and see a picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 52:54      | And every time it's a different picture and it delights me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:56      | But then I have the bottom third of the screen where a normal person would put apps, but I have the smaller element down there.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 53:03      | And I'm sorry, the medium element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:05      | So it's like two by four set of icons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:08      | And I have that with two things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:10      | It's either shortcuts with four buttons or [[Drafts]], which the [[Drafts]] for those of you that love [[Drafts]], just wait until you kid.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 53:18      | That's 14 anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:20      | So good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:21      | So I only have four buttons and that was the problem I was facing is how do I get my shortcuts library into four buttons?                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 53:26      | Well, it really wasn't that hard for me because there's three shortcuts that I use all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:32      | And, you know, going back to the top of the show when I talked about I'm doing this [[Keyboard Maestro]] contextual thing, I do the same thing with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:40      | So I like to think in terms of context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 53:42      | So like I'm going to do MacSparky now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 53:45      | I press the MacSparky shortcut, it's a choose from menu list that has all of the shortcuts that relate to MacSparky.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:52      | You know, one of them may be set a toggle timer for planning and open the MacSparky planning page or view in OmniFocus.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 54:02      | Or it'll be like check my email and it will set a toggle timer for checking email for MacSparky and then go into this MacSparky email inbox in mail.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 54:13      | It won't go into the Spark's law or the personal one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:16      | So I love the idea of staying in my lane in terms of when I want to work on one area of my life, I just go there and I can use shortcuts to force me down those lanes.                                                                                                                                     |
| 54:27      | In addition, I've got a bunch of MacSparky related shortcuts, you know, all the steps it goes through to prepare a new blog post from setting up the draft to setting down me focus task and, you know, stacking things exactly what shortcuts is really good at.                                         |
| 54:41      | So I have those three and so those are the first three buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:45      | One is personal, you know, one is MacSparky, one is legal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:49      | So I had one button left and then just one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:53      | Yeah, so then what I did was I have created a bunch of choose from menu shortcuts on different areas of my life like photography or system that's got all the various, you know, system apps and settings I do to one's called music.                                                                      |
| 55:07      | And it opens like it's got access to the tuner app that I use when I play my sax and the, you know, the app I use to reach sheet music.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:15      | So I've got these various other like choose from menu groups and historically I had all those on the home screen.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 55:23      | But then what I did now is I just made one called groups and that's got all of those groups under it.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 55:29      | So it's a choose from menu to choose from menu, if that makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 55:33      | And so it adds one extra step, but in trade off for that, I get to have a full size calendar on my home screen, which to me is like a total worth it.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 55:43      | You know, I can look at my phone at any time and know what my next three events are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 55:47      | And if you block schedule like me, that is really nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:51      | Yes, I'm really looking forward to seeing what other widgets app developers come up with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:57      | So I'm on quite a few betas, so I've seen things, many things I'm not allowed to talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:03      | So in order to make sure that I don't break anybody's rules, I'm just not going to say anything except for [[Dark Noise]] has got one and I actually like that.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:08      | And I love having a stack of widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 56:10      | So at the moment I have, I've been, I've been trying the MacSparky method because, you know, we've been talking about this off the air as well as on the air, David.                                                                                                                                      |
| 56:19      | And so I've been trying that with where I've got four shortcuts for the four different areas of my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:23      | So I've got my day job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 56:25      | I've got automators, I've got nested folders and I've got screencasts online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 56:29      | I think I'm going to have to do some consolidation there because like the suite setup is not on my home screen.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:34      | And I would really like to have everything that I'm doing, you know, available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:38      | So I might have to have Rosemary Orchard nerd and then moving house is another one because that appears to be taking over my life right now.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:44      | He knew that was so complicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 56:46      | If we got robots to automate that yet, David, or something, I really need something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:50      | Yeah, that would help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 56:52      | Let me know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:54      | Yeah, if anybody has automations for moving house, then please let me know because I would really love that.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:59      | But yeah, so I've got that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 57:01      | But then I realised that there are a couple of shortcuts that I access quite frequently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 57:05      | And sometimes I need access to with just a few tabs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:09      | So for example, I was driving the other day and I realised actually I didn't need to go where my map had told me where I was going,                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 57:16      | or where I'd originally set my map to where I was going, I needed to go somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 57:20      | So I pulled over to the side of the road and, you know, reprogram my map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 57:24      | But I had to take my phone out of the holder on my dashboard and do everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 57:29      | And I was pulled off the road and I saved parking lots, so it was safe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 57:32      | But I was there going, there's got to be a better way to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:35      | And of course, I do have, you know, a shortcut for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 57:39      | I have my driving shortcut, which I use every time I drive where I touch my phone to an NFC tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:44      | But that would restart my music and stuff like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:46      | And I realised I can break this down and just take the destinations part out of it and run that in the main shortcut.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 57:52      | But then I can also have the destinations in like a quick access area on my home screen where I can just swipe to get to it and tap it.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:01      | And then it will go, hey, where do you want to go?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 58:04      | And I decided to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:06      | And so I've now started adding a few shortcuts, like anything, anytime that I think of something I need to buy from my new place,                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:12      | a shortcut pops up and is like, hey, what do you need to buy? I type in a list of stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 58:16      | And then it asks me for each one, you know, like, is this something that you need to buy here or there or just anywhere and adds it to my OmniFocus.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 58:24      | So I've got multiple shortcuts, folders stacked as widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 58:30      | And one of them is called quick access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:33      | And the other one is called home screen because I'm very creative with naming and each of these just contains four shortcuts for the time being.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 58:40      | But I am considering potentially switching this to one big shortcut, one big widget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 58:46      | But at the moment, I am unable to stack big widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 58:49      | So I think this is a problem because of my screen size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:54      | But I've not tried, I've not put my old 10s max that I use for testing things that don't work on iOS 14 on iOS 14 yet.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 59:03      | So I can't be 100% sure there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 59:06      | Yeah, I tested like stacking these medium size widgets with, you know, multiple shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 59:12      | But I found that the time it was taking me to get to the right set of shortcuts was more frustrating to me than the time it takes me to just get to it to a choose from menu.                                                                                                                              |
| 59:23      | One of the nice things they did with these widgets is the way display shortcuts is really clean.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 59:28      | It comes from the top down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 59:30      | It only fills up as much screen as it needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 59:32      | So it really almost feels like a built in app if you run it from a widget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 59:37      | So I think a lot of people are going to want to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 59:39      | And I had to think along and hard about putting, and I guess I'm maybe I'm not supposed to talk about [[Drafts]].                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 59:44      | Sorry, Greg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 59:46      | I think [[Drafts]] is okay to talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 59:48      | Greg's pretty open about what he does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 59:50      | But the, but that one I thought long and hard about, but I like [[Drafts]] so much that that is the one I'm willing to toggle with the shortcuts widget.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 59:59      | Like, okay, go to [[Drafts]] and then go to my my MacSparky cooking view, which is my filter that shows me the posts.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00:08   | I'm the process of writing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:00:10   | So it's just like some of this stuff is just so fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:00:12   | But yeah, it really is interesting to me that very quickly I've got to a point where the only apps on my home screen are in my dock.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:20   | And it's just not been a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:23   | And even at least right now, I don't even have any apps on the second screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:28   | It goes to the, what's that view called the app library on the second page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:00:32   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:00:33   | So my second page is actually widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:00:35   | And then I have the app library after that because I have some more things I want to be able to quickly see, but I'm not so keen on necessarily having immediately under my thumb.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00:44   | So for example, the [[Dark Noise]] widget is stacked with a couple of other things on the second page.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00:50   | Because I like to be able to get it that quickly, but I don't necessarily need to be able to, you know, get it that so quickly.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:00:59   | It's not, you know, urgent information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:02   | So I put those on the today view screen, you know, the historical today view screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:01:06   | So I've got a bunch of I swiped to the two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:01:09   | I've abandoned that screen because at one point I couldn't edit it and I kind of then forgot about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:15   | So I should go back and revisit that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:17   | Yeah, it's nice. And I will let you know that I now have a clock on my today view screen very clearly shows me what time it is in London.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:24   | So I will no longer be clueless when I talk to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:27   | I should note that at like 7pm here, Dave has been asking, like, are you in bed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:01:33   | And I'm like, no, it's 7pm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:01:35   | I've just had dinner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:36   | I don't know what the block is there for me, but for some reason I always think I'm calling you at like 2am.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:01:41   | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:01:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:43   | You've never called me at 2am, David, so we're good. And also I have dinner disturbed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:47   | So even if you did call me, it wouldn't go through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:49   | I have faith in D&D. I'm good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:01:51   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:52   | But anyway, so there's the answer. I feel like it's going to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:56   | To me, the answer is use choose from menu and consolidate down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:03   | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:04   | And because I do these contextual based shortcuts, it really isn't that big of a stretch for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:02:08   | Because when I press the max parking button, there's a button there that says RSS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:14   | All it does is open my RSS app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:16   | But then there's a button there that says, write a new blog post and it's like a 20 step shortcut that does a whole bunch of things.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:02:21   | And I, you know, mixing them together under one menu is not a problem for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:02:26   | So I think that's a nice way to solve the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:30   | Or you could also just go back to the old way and make separate shortcut icons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:34   | You don't have to use these widgets at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:36   | The advantage of the widgets over the separate shortcut icons is then you do get it running like it's running through Siri.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:42   | So that means like menus pop down from the dock and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:45   | Whereas if you add the shortcut directly to your home screen, it will open the shortcuts app and run it.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:50   | Now it doesn't do what it used to do a very long time ago, which is that dance to [[Safari]] leaving you with an empty [[Safari]] tab and then to shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:02:58   | It does just go straight to shortcuts, but that's still something that people may want to take into account when they're doing this.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:05   | Oh, I'm totally sold on the widget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:07   | I am not going back to the home screen icons on my desktop or my home screen more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:03:12   | It's just not going to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:13   | And it's driving me nuts that I can't put more widgets on the iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:17   | That's probably discussion for another day, but [[Apple]], if you're listening, please more widgets on the iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:23   | I have a big screen and want to fill it with widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:25   | Yeah, I mean, so like on the iPad, it's worse than the iPhone because basically on the iPhone, you have six medium units.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:34   | You could have, you know, three medium, I'm sorry, you have three medium units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:37   | You can have three medium size widgets or you could have, you know, one big one and one medium size.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:43   | But the default on the iPad is two medium size widgets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:03:46   | You've got to actually scroll to see any more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:49   | So it's actually harder on the iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:50   | You have less room for widgets on the iPad as it boots up than you do on the iPhone, which is crazy to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:56   | But like I said, I think I'm wanting, I've submitted tickets on this and I don't think it's going to change.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:03   | Send feedback to [[Apple]] people, send feedback to [[Apple]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:06   | Maybe it's a low hanging fruit for 14.3 or whenever they have more features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:12   | I hope so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:13   | But the, so on the iPad, even with less space, I still give one medium slot to shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:20   | I mean, it's got to be there for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:22   | And it's the same shortcuts on your iPad as on your iPad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:24   | Yeah, yeah, exact same ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:26   | Yeah, at the moment on the iPad, I'm still using home screen icons and just opening the shortcuts app and searching.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:32   | But it's probably going to change as my usage evolves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:05:16   | I was just doing this the other day and DEVONthink, I have a document I want to send off to a client.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:21   | It's a PDF, but it's a draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:05:23   | I have an imprint built into DEVONthink that just puts a big draft stamp on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:05:28   | So I press one button in DEVONthink that I can share to the client with a draft stamp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:05:54   | You want to name a file, you can do it, you want to put it in a specific location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:57   | You can do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:05:58   | You can even automate copying it out to an external folder outside of DEVONthink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:02   | So let's say you've got a [[Dropbox]] folder you share with somebody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:06   | You can do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:07   | So you can delegate the boring repeating tasks to DEVONthink and get back to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 01:06:57   | And I've seen a lot of things coming from you recently where you've been showing off what you've been doing.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:01   | So do you want to tell us about some of that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 01:07:05   | I'm actually looking for you to punch holes in it for me because you're one of my favourite automators.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:09   | Well, I do that sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:10   | But, you know, I try and be nice as well because, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:07:13   | just punching holes in things all the time is not necessarily productive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07:17   | Well, there's a problem I've been trying to solve recently with automation in terms of email automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:23   | And this is for the legal job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:25   | A lot of times I get emails that are a substance that I want to keep, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:31   | and I have been using different ways to solve this problem over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:35   | But like creating a link to an email, I don't think really is a good solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:07:39   | because then it's got to like link to my email app to get a copy of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:43   | And ultimately I decided the problem is something that I just need to print them off as PDFs.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:07:49   | There's some emails I need to keep like a historical record of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:52   | So, you know, the I went through the various phases with this, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:57   | the first thing I did was use [[Apple Mail\|Apple Mail's]] built in export as PDF feature,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:04   | which I have discovered recently is terrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:08:07   | It doesn't work 100% of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:09   | So for a little while I was doing it and I had assigned its own keyboard shortcut,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:13   | I was using option command P and it would use the export as PDF in [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:20   | And I went back and looked at some of them and they were blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:22   | And I'm like, huh, you know, that's not what I want when I press export as PDF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:27   | I don't want you to make a blank PDF for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:08:29   | I'd actually like you to make a PDF of the email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:32   | So I went looking through the forums and sure enough,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:08:36   | there's other people experiencing the same behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:39   | So there's something broken in export as PDF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:08:42   | It's not just a Big Sur thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:44   | I think it's been going on now for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:08:46   | But the good news is [[Apple Mail\|Apple Mail's]] still has the command P print                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:51   | and then command P print as PDF feature, which you can do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:08:55   | So I was putting a delay and I'd hit command P to print and it gives you a print preview                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:00   | and it would show me that it had actually rendered a PDF of the email                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:09:04   | and then I hit command P again with another little keyboard automation to save as PDF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:09   | So I was doing that and that's what kind of got me down the automation path,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:09:13   | realising, oh, I'm doing this repeatedly many times a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:17   | This is something I should automate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:09:18   | Why should I hit command P pause for two seconds and then hit command P again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:23   | So that was the first script I wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:09:25   | It's just a simple keyboard master script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:27   | But then I got thinking, well, if I'm going to do this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:09:30   | if I'm going to go through the trouble of automating hitting command P twice,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:09:34   | and I do put a two second delay just to give myself a chance to see                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:09:37   | that it's rendered properly because I don't trust it at this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:09:40   | Well, why don't I just name it too, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:42   | And because that's opening a save dialog box,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:09:46   | I can tab into that with [[Keyboard Maestro]] and type in a name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:09:50   | And initially, I did that as an inquiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:54   | I would put up an inquiry to the user to say, what's the date?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:59   | Who's the sender? Who's the recipient?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:01   | What's the subject of this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:10:02   | And I could type in some variables and it would fill it in for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:10:06   | I could have alternatively done that as a TextExpander script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:10:10   | But I quickly realised, well, that's okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:13   | But that's not perfect because the date,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:16   | in order to get the date and time of the email,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:10:18   | I have to look at the email separately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:20   | Or if I just pull the automatic date in,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:22   | it's going to have the date that I'm running the script,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:24   | which is not the time the email was sent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:27   | So then I started thinking, well,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:28   | why don't I query [[Apple Mail]] to give me the date and time of the original email?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:10:35   | Which ultimately led me down the AppleScript.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:39   | You know, rabbit hole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:41   | And AppleScript and [[Apple Mail]] work together pretty well,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:46   | but they are also kind of goofy, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:48   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:10:49   | There's like whoever did the original dictionary for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:52   | I don't think they were, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:10:54   | it's like just to give you an example,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:10:58   | and I'm going to share the script when the show publishes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:01   | But the sender and the recipient,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:04   | so I wanted to ultimately do is grab the date and time of the email,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:08   | then I wanted to put the name of the sender and the name of the recipient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:12   | in the name of the email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:14   | So I can look in the file and see,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:16   | sorted by date that I put in the name of the recipient dash name,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:22   | I'm sorry, name of the sender dash name of recipient,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:25   | and then another dash with the subject line from the email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:11:28   | So getting those, all those pieces together was what I wanted to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:34   | It was harder than you think because sender is a term in the [[Apple Mail]] dictionary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:11:40   | So like get sender of this email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:43   | So I figured that out relatively quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:45   | So if I wanted to add the recipient,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:47   | what do you think the term is you would use?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:50   | Don't tell, if you already know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:11:52   | No, I don't actually know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:54   | I'm just guessing getter or something crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:56   | Get what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:57   | Getter is in like get the get person getting this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12:01   | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:02   | Getter, that's a good thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:04   | Well, the verb you use in AppleScript is get from the mail entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:12:08   | So you get sender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12:10   | So you would think the other one would be get recipient, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:13   | Sender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:12:14   | Logically, that would be very logical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:16   | So I spent a bunch of time like banging my head against the wall and recipient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:21   | And what I didn't do, and if Sal is listening, he's laughing at me,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:12:25   | because him and I actually talked after I solved the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:27   | And he told me, yeah, you did this in the wrong order, Dave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:31   | All I had to do is go to the dictionary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:33   | If you go in the scripting app, there's a dictionary for every app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:12:36   | But the answer was an [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:12:39   | It's two recipients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:12:42   | So get two recipients with an S on the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:12:45   | And the thing that really drives me crazy, Rose,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:12:47   | is for like 30 minutes, I was trying to recipient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12:51   | It never occurred to me to put an S on the end, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:56   | Oh, poor David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:59   | But anyway, I eventually got there and I came up with a script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:13:02   | that yanks out the date and the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:06   | And then there's a whole bunch of AppleScripting I had to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:13:09   | to turn that into the ISO format where it's day, month,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:13   | dash year and numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:15   | But I don't need to bore you with the details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:13:17   | You guys can download it and play with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:19   | And then it dashes with the name of the sender,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:22   | dash name of recipient, then it dashes and gives me the subject line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:26   | And with all of those bits together,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:13:29   | now I have a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script that will hit the print twice,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:35   | save it, let me check it, pull all that data out, name the file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:39   | And then the last thing is it tabs and adds the email tag to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:43   | And it leaves the cursor in the tag field with the email tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:47   | and I just type the client name as a tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:50   | And then, so all I have to do is hit the,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:53   | which by the way, the [[Keyboard Maestro]] script I use is option command P,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:59   | which is what I used to use to do the print, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:02   | but now it just does a whole bunch more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:04   | And at the end, all I do is type in the client name as a tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:07   | and it saves it to a folder on iCloud and [[Hazel]] says,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:11   | oh, hey, there's an email tag                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:14:14   | and it's got the, you know, Wiley Coyote client tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:14:18   | So put this into the email file folder with the Wiley Coyote email folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:24   | And all this happens very quickly and it's great,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:26   | but it did, I spent like two hours writing the script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:29   | and honestly, it took me a half hour to write the script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:33   | and it took me an hour and a half to figure out the two recipient                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:36   | because I was too stupid to go into the dictionary at the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:14:39   | Well, I mean, it happens to everybody, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:43   | I had a thing earlier today where I was trying to figure out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:45   | why a script at work wasn't working, turned out I was running it from the wrong folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:14:49   | Stuff doesn't work if it doesn't have access to the right data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:52   | So, you know, it happens to us all, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:56   | But I've been playing with things as well because, I mean,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:59   | you've been inspiring me because you've been sending me a lot of things recently,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:15:02   | a lot of which we're going to see in the next couple of weeks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:05   | and months coming out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:07   | But I realised this morning, so as I've mentioned several times,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:11   | I'm moving house, there is no automation for this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:15:13   | but there are a heck of a lot of tasks in OmniFocus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:16   | And I've got projects left, right and centre,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:19   | I've got tags, I've got all sorts of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:15:22   | One of the things I realised I needed earlier today was a way to assign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:26   | a whole group of tasks to different rooms of my new place                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:31   | so that I would know, you know, like this goes to this room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:15:33   | and that goes in that room and that needs to be done in this room and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:15:36   | So if I'm looking and my dad says, hey, like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:39   | do you need me to do anything for you in the living room?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:41   | I can be like, yes, actually,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:43   | I need you to remove the electric fire and stuff like that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:46   | because I have an electric fire in the living room of my new place                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:15:49   | and I don't need it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:51   | So I decided that I was going to solve this with Omni Automation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:56   | and it's a great little script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:59   | What I have is I have a tag called home that starts with a house emoji                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:03   | and then space in the word home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:05   | And under this, I have every single room in my house                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:16:08   | and I select, say, for example, 10 tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:12   | and I run my script and it pops up a single prompt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:16:16   | with every single one of my tasks as a line                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:16:19   | and then a select item on the right-hand side of it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:24   | with each of the rooms in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:26   | And I go through and I assign a room to each task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:29   | and the room is a tag and then I hit OK and it's done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:32   | And it just goes through and it assigns every single one of them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:36   | to the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:16:38   | Now, it's a dumb script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:40   | It doesn't check whether or not things have already got rooms assigned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:42   | because I realised I could solve that with perspectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:45   | and I didn't want to spend very long on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:47   | But it is great because it means that I've gone through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:49   | and I've assigned things and then I realised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:16:51   | that I have a whole list of things to buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:53   | And I was like, well, it would be great to know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:16:55   | where these things are going to go when I'm buying them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:57   | so that if I'm buying two blue items for the bedroom,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:00   | I can check that the blues actually coordinate with each other                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:02   | and stuff like that, fun things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:05   | So, I decided to go through and do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:17:07   | And so, I had a very unproductive afternoon                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:17:10   | sitting in the garden where it was 95 degrees Fahrenheit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:17:14   | and we don't have air conditioning in this country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:16   | So, it was hot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:17:18   | And so, I went and sat in the garden for a while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:20   | and assigned all of these different things to rooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:22   | And it's great. I now know where everything goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:17:25   | Yeah, don't get me started on air conditioning in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:28   | Hey, just go to Stonehenge. It's nice and cold there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:30   | I don't even plan about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:17:32   | Yeah, that's right. I was there in the summer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:34   | I wanted to, because I love woodworking,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:17:36   | and the Victorian Albert has this amazing woodworking display.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:40   | And it's on the top floor of the Victoria Albert.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:17:43   | It's like a greenhouse up there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:47   | Yeah, it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:49   | There's like 800-year-old wood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:17:51   | I should point out Queen Victoria was on the throne in the 1800s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:17:55   | Air conditioning didn't exist in America back then either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:58   | Yeah, but I feel like if you're going to put this beautiful ancient,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:18:01   | some of this Egyptian furniture up there, why not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:04   | Oh, the actual exhibits are climate controlled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18:07   | They just don't waste it on the guests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:08   | No, no, they are not. The furniture is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:18:11   | Really? It is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:12   | What? I thought it was all behind glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:18:14   | Nope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:15   | I know all of the costumes that they have there are climate controlled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:18   | because fabric has to be well looked after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:18:20   | Otherwise, it just disintegrates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:18:22   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:23   | Well, anyway, I went off on a tangent there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:25   | But I love that you're moving rows because I can't,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:18:27   | I just love all the automation that's coming out of rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:18:29   | Oh, as soon as I get in there, I mean, okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:32   | This is the kind of nerdy I've got to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:35   | I've ordered a new controller for my desk, which is smarter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:38   | So I have a nice fancy sit-stand desk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:40   | It's the IKEA Bekant for anybody who's curious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:18:43   | But the controller that comes in it is kind of dumb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:18:46   | So you press and hold the up button until it's at the right height                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:49   | and you press and hold the down button until it's at the right height.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:51   | And it doesn't remember heights, like at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:18:54   | It's very dumb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18:55   | But I found somebody on the internet and they have an open source project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:58   | Where you can make a new controller, which will remember things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:19:02   | And I was there going, this is wonderful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:19:04   | But I don't own a soldering iron and with the current list of 291 items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:19:08   | that I need to purchase from my new place,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:19:10   | I don't really want to add a soldering iron is number 292.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:19:14   | And then I would have to buy all the different components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:19:17   | And then I noticed that they have a link where they sell the controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:19:20   | So I ordered a new controller for my desk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:19:22   | So when I reassemble it, I'll be able to press and hold the up button                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:19:26   | and it will remember and then I can just press the up button say twice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:19:29   | and it will go to position two, which is going to be great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:19:32   | Because right now I'm currently sitting mostly inside of a wardrobe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:19:36   | in my parents place and I am literally melting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:19:39   | I have items of clothing stuck to me because it's very hot in here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:19:43   | and there's no airflow because of noise while recording.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:19:46   | Well, you were living the dream because when you're alone in your new house,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:19:50   | you know, you don't have other people living with you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:19:52   | So you can go completely bananas with the home kid automation stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:19:56   | Like if I do certain things with my house, my family will rebel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:20:01   | and probably lock me out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:20:03   | But when you're on your own, look out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:20:05   | That said, I am planning on making things guest friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:20:08   | So instead of putting hue lights in the overhead lights,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:11   | I think I'm going to get, we don't have [[Lutron]] Caseta over here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:20:15   | But there is, I think it's called Lightwave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:17   | They're available for sale in the [[Apple Store]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:20:19   | Now these switches are not cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:20:21   | They're like 60 pounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:23   | So maybe 70, $75 each, which is kind of pricey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:20:27   | But if I put those in, then I'm still going to be able to control everything with my phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:20:31   | And I, okay, I wouldn't have fancy coloured lights in the overheads,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:20:34   | but I can live without that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:36   | And I'll just have coloured lights as accent everywhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:38   | Oh yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:39   | I'm so happy I did that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:40   | It took me like a year and a half to slowly,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:42   | I didn't like just spend all the money at once,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:20:44   | but you know, I'd buy myself a present once in a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:47   | It would be a [[Lutron]] switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:48   | And now it's all throughout the house and it's just great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:20:51   | That's exactly what I'm going to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:20:53   | And I'm also probably going to get ceiling fans for the bedroom and my office slash studio,                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:20:58   | because I want air circulation in those rooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:21:02   | And it would be great to have a way of doing that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:21:04   | And if I get the one with the remote control,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:21:06   | then maybe I can get fancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:21:09   | I don't necessarily want to buy a whole extra [[Logitech Harmony]] for that though,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:21:13   | because they come with like [[IR]] remotes, like, you know, the old TV remotes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:21:17   | But, you know, I'll see what I can do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:21:19   | Worst case scenario, I have a remote control on my desk where I can turn on and off the fan.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:21:23   | So it'll be better than sitting here sweltering in my parents' house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:27   | I hadn't thought about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:21:28   | I should probably get an [[IR blaster]] that I could automate to drive our fan from,                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21:33   | because it is just an [[IR]] remote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21:35   | MacSparky, you have a homework assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:21:37   | Figure out automating [[IR Blaster\|IR blasters]] without using the[[Logitech Harmony\|Logitech Harmony Hub]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:21:41   | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:42   | And get back to me, because I'm going to need that in the future,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:21:45   | but I'm not there yet and I don't want to go too crazy just yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

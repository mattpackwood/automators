| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to the Automator's Podcast.                                     |
| 00:04      | I am David Sparks and joined by my fellow co-host.                                 |
| 00:07      | Hello, Rosemary, how are you today?                                                |
| 00:09      | I am great, David.                                                                 |
| 00:11      | How are you doing?                                                                 |
| 00:12      | I am having a great time.                                                          |
| 00:14      | We've got a good guest today.                                                      |
| 00:15      | We're gonna be talking some automation,                                            |
| 00:16      | but before we do so, I just wanted to take a minute                                |
| 00:19      | to acknowledge your new show.                                                      |
| 00:22      | You have something exciting to share with the audience.                            |
| 00:25      | Yes, yes, I do.                                                                    |
| 00:26      | I am officially joining TWIT,                                                      |
| 00:28      | not involving moving to California joining TWIT,                                   |
| 00:31      | but I am helping Micah Sargent host iOS today as of January.                       |
| 00:35      | So that's a weekly show available over at TWIT.tv.                                 |
| 00:39      | And we get to talk about all things iOS,                                           |
| 00:41      | including sometimes automation,                                                    |
| 00:43      | but mostly just iOS and our workflows.                                             |
| 00:46      | I mean, Micah is one of my favourite people in technology,                          |
| 00:49      | and honestly, he's better than me,                                                 |
| 00:52      | so you've upgraded co-hosts in my opinion.                                         |
| 00:55      | I wouldn't say it's an upgrade.                                                    |
| 00:56      | I'd say it's a lateral.                                                            |
| 00:57      | You're both amazing people,                                                        |
| 00:58      | and you both have different takes on things,                                       |
| 01:00      | which is always the interesting thing to look at.                                  |
| 01:03      | And I'm pleased I get to work with everybody I love.                               |
| 01:06      | I think that nobody,                                                               |
| 01:08      | I can't think of anybody better than you                                           |
| 01:10      | to be hosting a show called iOS today.                                             |
| 01:12      | And I've been watching it.                                                         |
| 01:13      | I love what you're doing.                                                          |
| 01:15      | And all the automators,                                                            |
| 01:16      | you need to go out there and support Rose                                          |
| 01:18      | with this big move that she's made.                                                |
| 01:20      | Watch the show, give them some feedback,                                           |
| 01:22      | and I couldn't be happier for you, Rose.                                           |
| 01:25      | I'm so excited that you're on that show now.                                       |
| 01:28      | Well, thank you very much.                                                         |
| 01:29      | I'm really looking forward to producing that weekly.                               |
| 01:32      | And of course, I'm still gonna be here                                             |
| 01:33      | on Automators and Nested Folders.                                                 |
| 01:34      | None of that's changing.                                                           |
| 01:35      | I'm just doing more podcasting,                                                    |
| 01:36      | because I love it so much.                                                         |
| 01:38      | Yeah, I'm not letting you go.                                                      |
| 01:39      | So, Rose is stuck with us.                                                         |
| 01:41      | We have a guest today, Adam Tow.                                                   |
| 01:43      | Welcome back to the Automators.                                                    |
| 01:46      | Thanks for having me.                                                              |
| 01:48      | Adam is, and I think I told the story.                                             |
| 01:50      | You were on, I think, Episode 29.                                                  |
| 01:51      | I told the story about how the first time I met you                                |
| 01:53      | was at Sal Soghoians Automation Summit.                                           |
| 01:56      | And you had this amazing photography automation.                                   |
| 01:59      | And you have really kind of come into your own                                     |
| 02:02      | the last few years, Adam,                                                          |
| 02:04      | with the various applications you've released.                                     |
| 02:07      | Adam Gang is the guy who makes shortcuts easier for you.                           |
| 02:12      | And Adam makes applications                                                        |
| 02:14      | that you can buy in the App Store                                                  |
| 02:16      | that add features and simplicity to automating shortcuts.                          |
| 02:21      | And the most recent one you have made is MFC Deck,                                 |
| 02:24      | which is kind of amazing.                                                          |
| 02:25      | Thanks.                                                                            |
| 02:26      | Yeah, the first, I think the second time we met was at [[WWDC]]                        |
| 02:30      | right after they introduced iOS 13.                                                |
| 02:33      | And I hadn't written any apps.                                                     |
| 02:34      | I hadn't written any apps then.                                                    |
| 02:35      | I had some kind of like very complicated shortcuts.                                |
| 02:38      | But then shortly after that, I started writing apps.                               |
| 02:41      | Yeah, I remember,                                                                  |
| 02:42      | because you were showing me this,                                                  |
| 02:44      | a build your own adventure story that you'd written,                               |
| 02:46      | which even used the translation feature.                                           |
| 02:48      | So I was actually playing with it in French.                                       |
| 02:50      | And that was just amazing.                                                         |
| 02:51      | And it's amazing what you're able to do with shortcuts,                            |
| 02:54      | because of course shortcuts,                                                       |
| 02:56      | if you've got the right brain,                                                     |
| 02:57      | you can turn it to all sorts of complicated things.                                |
| 02:59      | But I'm really glad that you're using that brain                                   |
| 03:02      | to create apps so that other people                                                |
| 03:04      | can do this kind of thing as well.                                                 |
| 03:06      | Definitely.                                                                        |
| 03:07      | Like I kind of look at kind of the features                                        |
| 03:10      | that shortcuts lacks,                                                              |
| 03:11      | and I try to implement them in an app.                                             |
| 03:13      | And then a year later,                                                             |
| 03:15      | [[Apple]] goes in and implements those features themselves                             |
| 03:18      | into the main app.                                                                 |
| 03:20      | I mean, they implemented some other features of launch cuts,                       |
| 03:22      | but they certainly didn't implement smart folders,                                 |
| 03:24      | which is the feature I'm still using launch cuts for.                              |
| 03:26      | That's pretty much what I live for,                                                |
| 03:28      | just use it for smart folders.                                                     |
| 03:30      | And I don't really use folders and shortcuts,                                      |
| 03:31      | a huge amount because of that.                                                     |
| 03:33      | Yeah, I mean, and you know,                                                        |
| 03:35      | they also didn't give nested folders,                                              |
| 03:37      | which is another thing that you've done.                                           |
| 03:39      | And I feel like you are in safe space there.                                       |
| 03:42      | You make apps that kind of go beyond                                               |
| 03:45      | the most basic features,                                                           |
| 03:46      | because [[Apple]] can't do real complicated things                                     |
| 03:50      | along these features,                                                              |
| 03:51      | because they want their users not to get confused,                                 |
| 03:54      | and they want to make it easy for everyone.                                        |
| 03:56      | But you're there for the power users                                               |
| 03:58      | with the stuff you make.                                                           |
| 03:59      | And honestly, I really have to give a shout out to [[Apple]].                          |
| 04:03      | When you first started building these apps,                                        |
| 04:05      | I was a little worried                                                             |
| 04:06      | that it wasn't going to get through the app store,                                 |
| 04:08      | that they would say,                                                               |
| 04:09      | because there are apps out there                                                   |
| 04:11      | that add actions to shortcuts,                                                     |
| 04:13      | but your app really adds features to shortcuts.                                    |
| 04:17      | And I didn't know how that was going to go down,                                   |
| 04:19      | but they approved it,                                                              |
| 04:20      | and you've got a successful business out of it.                                    |
| 04:23      | Yeah, there was a little precedent in that                                         |
| 04:25      | there were some apps like Launch Center Pro and Push Cut,                          |
| 04:28      | which did the sync of shortcuts.                                                   |
| 04:30      | So you could select a shortcut within those apps,                                  |
| 04:33      | but they just got like a list of names of the shortcuts,                           |
| 04:36      | and then they would just call the shortcuts app to run them.                       |
| 04:39      | But what I was doing was I was actually like                                       |
| 04:41      | sucking down kind of information about the shortcut                                |
| 04:43      | from like the icons to action lists and things like that.                          |
| 04:48      | And I was able to create, you know, launch cuts out of that,                       |
| 04:50      | and then eventually MFC Deck.                                                        |
| 04:53      | All right, so let's,                                                               |
| 04:54      | we didn't really talk about launch cuts                                            |
| 04:55      | because you came here before that came out.                                        |
| 04:58      | So, but Rose and I have mentioned it on the show                                   |
| 05:00      | in the interim,                                                                    |
| 05:01      | but just take a minute to explain the launch cuts,                                 |
| 05:04      | but I want to focus on the MFC Deck.                                                 |
| 05:06      | So explain what launch cuts does.                                                  |
| 05:08      | Sure, so launch cuts came out during the iOS 13 operating system,                  |
| 05:13      | and it basically brought folders to shortcuts.                                     |
| 05:16      | Now, with iOS 14, we all have folders on our shortcuts,                            |
| 05:19      | and I know a lot of people have been using them                                    |
| 05:21      | to organise their galleries.                                                       |
| 05:24      | But there's still a few features in launch cuts                                    |
| 05:26      | that doesn't exist in the shortcuts app on iOS 14,                                 |
| 05:29      | such as, as you mentioned before,                                                  |
| 05:30      | nested folders and tags.                                                           |
| 05:32      | Yeah, those are the two features                                                   |
| 05:34      | that I have been primarily using                                                   |
| 05:36      | because of course, for most people,                                                |
| 05:38      | folders themselves are great,                                                      |
| 05:40      | and that's what they need.                                                         |
| 05:41      | But for the shortcuts pro people,                                                  |
| 05:44      | having the ability to nest all of this                                             |
| 05:46      | and really go in deep is just wonderful.                                           |
| 05:49      | I think it really comes down to how many shortcuts you have.                       |
| 05:51      | I mean, if you've got 30 shortcuts,                                                |
| 05:53      | [[Apple|Apple's]] folder system is fine.                                                     |
| 05:55      | If you have 400, it probably isn't.                                                |
| 05:58      | So, and that's where you want to upgrade                                           |
| 06:01      | to something like launch cuts.                                                     |
| 06:02      | And it's a great app,                                                              |
| 06:04      | and I would argue it has not been Sherlock,                                        |
| 06:07      | although some of its features                                                      |
| 06:09      | have been incorporated into shortcuts.                                             |
| 06:10      | And I think that's almost the best of both worlds.                                 |
| 06:13      | I mean, if you're using the built-in folders                                       |
| 06:16      | with shortcuts and that's good enough for you,                                     |
| 06:18      | then don't worry about it, you're good.                                            |
| 06:20      | But if you're using the built-in folders                                           |
| 06:22      | and you're like, man, I really wish I could nest these                             |
| 06:24      | or just have more control over them,                                               |
| 06:27      | then there is an upgrade for you                                                   |
| 06:28      | that Adam has created with launch cuts.                                            |
| 06:31      | But the new app you came out with following iOS 14                                 |
| 06:36      | is the one that I am fascinated by.                                                |
| 06:39      | And we're gonna talk about that today.                                             |
| 06:41      | So, tell us a little bit about this new app,                                       |
| 06:44      | MFC, MFC Deck.                                                                     |
| 06:47      | I'm sorry, I was gonna say MFC cuts.                                               |
| 06:49      | I don't know what's wrong with my brain.                                           |
| 06:51      | Yeah, so MFC Deck is an application                                                |
| 06:53      | that I would say it takes shortcuts to the next level.                             |
| 06:57      | So it allows you to run shortcuts like launch cuts,                                |
| 07:01      | but you can actually send parameters to the shortcuts                              |
| 07:04      | and receive information back from the shortcut after it runs.                      |
| 07:07      | And with that, you can kind of create                                              |
| 07:09      | a visual representation of your shortcut after it's run.                           |
| 07:14      | So I developed this before iOS 14                                                  |
| 07:17      | home screen widgets were announced by [[Apple]].                                       |
| 07:20      | And so the original kind of tagline                                                |
| 07:22      | was widget ties your shortcuts.                                                    |
| 07:24      | And then iOS 14 came out and everyone's been, you know,                            |
| 07:27      | going hog wild with widgets on their home screen.                                  |
| 07:32      | But what this app does is it allows you                                            |
| 07:34      | to turn your shortcuts into widgets                                                |
| 07:36      | and put them into a control panel,                                                 |
| 07:39      | or what I'm calling a deck within the MFC Deck app.                                |
| 07:42      | So you can kind of visually see your shortcuts as widgets.                         |
| 07:47      | Yeah, and, you know, [[Apple]] does give widget support                                |
| 07:50      | for shortcuts once again, but it's under their terms                               |
| 07:54      | and under very kind of restrictive terms                                           |
| 07:57      | about the way it works, where MFC Deck kind of gives                               |
| 08:01      | the user more power.                                                               |
| 08:02      | Can you explain that a little bit?                                                 |
| 08:04      | Yeah, so right now with widgets and shortcuts,                                     |
| 08:07      | you on the home screen, you just basically tap it                                  |
| 08:09      | and it'll run the shortcut.                                                        |
| 08:11      | And that's it.                                                                     |
| 08:13      | You know, if the shortcut happens to display a menu,                               |
| 08:15      | it'll display a menu or maybe speak some text out to,                              |
| 08:19      | but that's it.                                                                     |
| 08:20      | What MFC Deck allows you to do is you can run the shortcut                         |
| 08:23      | and then the shortcut can return back a visual representation                      |
| 08:27      | of its results.                                                                    |
| 08:28      | So for instance, you have a weather shortcut.                                      |
| 08:31      | You can tap on it and then the widget will transform                               |
| 08:35      | to they show the weather information to you                                        |
| 08:39      | in a visual manner.                                                                |
| 08:41      | And some other apps do this also today.                                            |
| 08:44      | So there's like widget pack, which lets you create widgets                         |
| 08:46      | out of your shortcuts and [[Scriptable]] from [[Simon Støvring]],                          |
| 08:49      | let you do that using [[JavaScript]].                                                  |
| 08:51      | And so MFC Deck is another way that you can use to do that.                        |
| 08:55      | Now, there's other features about MFC Deck                                         |
| 08:57      | that I like to talk about.                                                         |
| 08:59      | So for instance, you can create a control deck.                                    |
| 09:02      | So for instance, let's say you have a bunch of widgets                             |
| 09:05      | or sorry, a bunch of shortcuts that control a Mac OS                               |
| 09:08      | application.                                                                       |
| 09:09      | You could have a deck that's like, say, mail or Zoom or X code.                    |
| 09:14      | And you can have all these buttons                                                 |
| 09:16      | that when you tap on them, they'll control your Mac app.                           |
| 09:19      | Or maybe you have a deck that's controlling your clipboard                         |
| 09:22      | contents.                                                                          |
| 09:23      | So you can have something that says make a piece of text                           |
| 09:26      | that's in the clipboard into a slug or uppercase all the text                      |
| 09:29      | or title case all the text.                                                        |
| 09:30      | So you can have basically a control deck.                                          |
| 09:34      | Think of it like a virtual [[Stream Deck]]                                             |
| 09:37      | if you're familiar with those devices on your iOS device.                          |
| 09:41      | And that really is where [[MFC Deck]] clicked for me.                                  |
| 09:45      | Because I have a [[Stream Deck]] on my desk.                                           |
| 09:47      | I have the 15 button [[Stream Deck]].                                                  |
| 09:49      | And it's great.                                                                    |
| 09:49      | And with the folders and the profiles and everything,                              |
| 09:51      | I can do a bunch of things I want with that.                                       |
| 09:54      | But what I really wanted was the interactive, much more                            |
| 09:59      | interactive deck where I can have a display information                            |
| 10:02      | and pull things out of stuff without having to figure out                          |
| 10:06      | a bunch of different APIs and things like that.                                    |
| 10:08      | And how do I connect to them with [[Keyboard Maestro]]                                 |
| 10:11      | and is [[Keyboard Maestro]] the best tool for this?                                    |
| 10:12      | Maybe I should do it in [[AppleScript]] and all this stuff.                           |
| 10:14      | When I've already programmed pretty much everything                                |
| 10:16      | I need in shortcuts, or there's apps out there                                     |
| 10:19      | to help me with that.                                                              |
| 10:20      | And that's where I've got MFC decks.                                               |
| 10:23      | So I have a couple of different decks.                                             |
| 10:24      | And I've got one on my desk.                                                       |
| 10:25      | It's displaying right now on my sadly otherwise barely used                        |
| 10:30      | iPad mini right now.                                                               |
| 10:32      | And it's for podcasting.                                                           |
| 10:34      | And it allows it shows me how long have I been podcasting                          |
| 10:37      | and what podcast am I currently doing                                              |
| 10:39      | and what's my upcoming podcast schedule and things like that.                      |
| 10:43      | And I'm really loving that because as well                                         |
| 10:46      | as showing me this information,                                                    |
| 10:47      | which I'm pulling out for resources,                                               |
| 10:49      | it also allows me to control things on my screen.                                  |
| 10:52      | So it's allowing me to push over information                                       |
| 10:56      | that I need as I need it.                                                          |
| 10:57      | And that's where it really clicked for me.                                         |
| 11:00      | Yeah, like I use these app palettes                                                |
| 11:03      | with [[Keyboard Maestro]] on the Mac                                                   |
| 11:05      | where I can pull up a list of commands                                             |
| 11:07      | related to a specific app.                                                         |
| 11:10      | This is what it felt like to me                                                    |
| 11:11      | as I was starting to play with these decks.                                        |
| 11:14      | The differences, the decks can actually feed you back                              |
| 11:17      | information as well, which is kind of exciting.                                    |
| 11:21      | But it is really a different way to automate on iOS                                |
| 11:25      | that goes a little bit beyond what you can do as shortcuts.                        |
| 11:28      | And congratulations on figuring this out.                                          |
| 11:32      | Yeah, another feature of MSC Deck                                                  |
| 11:33      | is its powerful automation feature.                                                |
| 11:36      | So I have a series of decks that I run automatically.                              |
| 11:41      | So basically there's, MSC Deck is comprised of decks and cards.                    |
| 11:44      | So think of decks like folders and cards are actions                               |
| 11:47      | that could do things like run a shortcut,                                          |
| 11:49      | display information, or get the contents of a URL.                                 |
| 11:53      | And I've set up these automations that run basically                               |
| 11:56      | every 15 minutes during the day, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.                             |
| 12:01      | And anytime I open up a deck,                                                      |
| 12:04      | I can see all that information's automatically been updated                        |
| 12:08      | after every 15 minutes.                                                            |
| 12:09      | And you can configure the actions so that they run                                 |
| 12:13      | on a schedule or they have a rate limit.                                           |
| 12:16      | So for instance, just say you have an action                                       |
| 12:19      | that runs a shortcut and you only want it to run once an hour.                     |
| 12:21      | You can configure that card so that it only runs once an hour                      |
| 12:25      | or only run on the weekdays or on the weekends.                                    |
| 12:28      | So it's a powerful way to kind of craft your shortcuts                             |
| 12:33      | around kind of the automated tasks                                                 |
| 12:35      | that you want to run throughout the day.                                           |
| 12:37      | Yeah, I'd never really thought of rate limiting automation tasks                   |
| 12:41      | but like one of the examples you gave me was                                       |
| 12:44      | that you rate limit your automation                                                |
| 12:47      | that backs up your shortcut files and you do it once a day.                        |
| 12:50      | I think you said it was like on a 14 hour timer.                                   |
| 12:53      | But so once a day, it'll hit that                                                  |
| 12:56      | and once it runs the action that backs up your shortcuts,                          |
| 13:00      | it's done because it's rate limited.                                               |
| 13:02      | But if you bump into that card 15 minutes later,                                   |
| 13:05      | it's going to say, well, I can't do that                                           |
| 13:07      | because I just did it 15 minutes ago.                                              |
| 13:09      | We haven't hit the 14 hour deadline yet.                                           |
| 13:11      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 13:12      | Yeah, and also because the shortcut can return a response back                     |
| 13:16      | to MFC deck, it can show you the last time                                         |
| 13:18      | it actually backed up your shortcut.                                               |
| 13:20      | Very clever.                                                                       |
| 13:22      | And it's like those are features that just don't exist                             |
| 13:25      | in shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 13:26      | I don't know that they ever will.                                                  |
| 13:28      | I'm sure the shortcuts team is playing with this app                               |
| 13:30      | and thinking about it.                                                             |
| 13:32      | But I have to feel like this is the kind of stuff                                  |
| 13:34      | that power users are going to want, but standard users.                            |
| 13:37      | I mean, you use the word rate limit to normal users,                               |
| 13:40      | they're just going to get cross-eyed and shut the app.                             |
| 13:43      | But I think this is something that can be really useful                            |
| 13:46      | for people who are serious about automating.                                       |
| 13:48      | Yeah, so there's another feature, I think.                                         |
| 13:52      | I mean, we look at iOS 14.                                                         |
| 13:54      | They release in 14.3 that the ability to have a shortcut                           |
| 13:58      | that's on the home screen, it just runs automatically.                             |
| 14:00      | It doesn't pop up the shortcuts app                                                |
| 14:02      | and then do its thing and then stop, right?                                        |
| 14:06      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 14:07      | I could easily see the shortcuts team adding something like                        |
| 14:11      | in the add to home screen section when you're creating                             |
| 14:14      | that shortcut, it says input, right?                                               |
| 14:17      | And then you could pass a certain input to that shortcut                           |
| 14:20      | that then is saved to the home screen.                                             |
| 14:22      | So one of the features that MSU deck has,                                          |
| 14:24      | and you can see this in the clipboard text editing examples                        |
| 14:27      | that I have on my website, is I have one shortcut                                  |
| 14:31      | that is duplicated like six or seven times in this clipboard deck.                 |
| 14:36      | And I just pass a different command to that shortcut                               |
| 14:40      | to say, you know, uppercase the text, lowercase the text,                          |
| 14:42      | slug the text.                                                                     |
| 14:44      | If you had to create those shortcuts in the shortcuts app today,                   |
| 14:47      | you'd have to have six or seven basically duplicate shortcuts,                     |
| 14:50      | right?                                                                             |
| 14:51      | But I can easily see the iOS team at [[Apple]] just adding just                        |
| 14:56      | that little text input field so that you can have one shortcut                     |
| 15:00      | but then you can duplicate it on the home screen to kind of                        |
| 15:04      | create this kind of control deck.                                                  |
| 15:06      | And I want to talk about how we're using this,                                     |
| 15:08      | but I want to get through some of the main features first.                         |
| 15:10      | And another one that stands out to me is just kind of the power                    |
| 15:14      | use of NFC tags.                                                                   |
| 15:16      | And we use those a lot, Rose,                                                      |
| 15:18      | and I just talked about it in the last episode of Automators.                      |
| 15:22      | But you have kind of come up with a solution to multi-purpose                      |
| 15:25      | NFC tags with this app.                                                            |
| 15:27      | Could you explain that?                                                            |
| 15:29      | So NFC deck actually used to be called NFC deck because the                        |
| 15:32      | original focus of the app was the supercharger use of NFC tags                     |
| 15:36      | and shortcuts.                                                                     |
| 15:38      | So what I'm able to do is you can create decks that basically                      |
| 15:42      | talk to the same NFC tags.                                                         |
| 15:44      | So depending on what deck is the current deck or the default                       |
| 15:47      | deck, a single NFC tag can have multiple actions associated                        |
| 15:51      | with it.                                                                           |
| 15:52      | So to give an example, I have a physical kind of booklet that                      |
| 15:57      | I've placed a five by four grid of NFC tags.                                       |
| 16:00      | So there's 20 NFC tags on it.                                                      |
| 16:02      | And I've created multiple decks that look identical to this                        |
| 16:05      | physical deck, except it's in virtual form.                                        |
| 16:08      | So the grid is like A1 to A5 all the way to D1, D5.                                |
| 16:13      | So the D5 tag, which is in the bottom right corner of this                         |
| 16:16      | physical deck, I could tap it in the morning and it will turn on                   |
| 16:20      | my lights in the office.                                                           |
| 16:22      | And if I tap it in the evening, it will turn off my lights.                        |
| 16:26      | So the same tag can be used to call different shortcuts depending                  |
| 16:32      | on which deck is currently active.                                                 |
| 16:35      | And I have automations that run throughout the day, which change                   |
| 16:38      | which deck is the current deck.                                                    |
| 16:41      | Right.                                                                             |
| 16:42      | And you're using the set default deck action for that in NFC,                      |
| 16:45      | in shortcuts, right?                                                               |
| 16:46      | That's how that changes.                                                           |
| 16:48      | That's correct.                                                                    |
| 16:49      | And time-based automation.                                                         |
| 16:50      | So you'll say after three o'clock switch to the night deck,                        |
| 16:54      | something like that.                                                               |
| 16:55      | Right.                                                                             |
| 16:56      | So it's similar to like setting your Apple watch face, right?                      |
| 16:59      | I have a morning action that changes my watch face to this                         |
| 17:02      | and then evening it switches to that.                                              |
| 17:03      | So it's the same thing, same concept.                                              |
| 17:06      | Right.                                                                             |
| 17:07      | And that makes a lot of sense because I know that I need                           |
| 17:10      | different things throughout the day and even different things                      |
| 17:12      | on different devices throughout the day, which is something                        |
| 17:14      | I'm experimenting with because one of the things I have is I have                  |
| 17:17      | a series of morning shortcuts run through a personal                               |
| 17:20      | automation when I'm using the sleep tracking built into iOS as                     |
| 17:25      | a trigger.                                                                         |
| 17:26      | And so it's, you know, once I've woken up and that alarm is                        |
| 17:29      | turned off, then I run an automation.                                              |
| 17:31      | And one of the things it does is it then at the end, it's                          |
| 17:33      | popping open my daily overview deck.                                               |
| 17:36      | I've not got a better name for it yet.                                             |
| 17:38      | I'll work on that at some point, but the important thing is inside                 |
| 17:41      | of that, it's showing me a bunch of content.                                       |
| 17:44      | Now previously I was experimenting with show result or having                      |
| 17:48      | Siri speak to me, but I have to say I'm not the most talkative                     |
| 17:51      | of people in the morning.                                                          |
| 17:53      | And I don't necessarily like having my device going and the                        |
| 17:56      | weather today is blah, blah, blah.                                                 |
| 17:58      | And so it's quite nice to just have, you know, a nice overview                     |
| 18:02      | of all of this information displayed, which I can then pop                         |
| 18:05      | back to you regularly during the day.                                              |
| 18:07      | So I've been experimenting with some of these other things,                        |
| 18:09      | you know, like widget pack and all of these other ones to get                      |
| 18:11      | data onto my home screen so that when I, you know, unlock my                       |
| 18:14      | phone, I see it.                                                                   |
| 18:15      | But what I like is having my own custom landing page.                              |
| 18:19      | And these were a big thing, you know, 10, 15 years ago, everybody                  |
| 18:22      | was creating their own custom, you know, dashboard or landing                      |
| 18:25      | page in their browser.                                                             |
| 18:27      | Well, I love having this in MFC deck because I'm having it update                  |
| 18:30      | with the information that I want based on, you know, different                     |
| 18:32      | things that I'm pulling at different times of day.                                 |
| 18:34      | So when I'm not at home, I'm just having it not show me home                       |
| 18:37      | related information, which is perfect for me.                                      |
| 18:41      | Yeah, what's your take on doing it within a home screen widget?                    |
| 18:45      | So if you have like a page, which is like your overview page                       |
| 18:49      | versus having doing it within MFC deck.                                            |
| 18:52      | Well, that is something that I am still very much experimenting                    |
| 18:55      | with because I have to say I have been super focused on just                       |
| 18:59      | playing with MFC deck itself rather than actually putting                          |
| 19:02      | things in the view.                                                                |
| 19:04      | Now I like having, you know, different specific cards because                      |
| 19:07      | that is great.                                                                     |
| 19:08      | I've stolen.                                                                       |
| 19:09      | I have to say I love the way that you've got the sample                            |
| 19:12      | weather deck.                                                                      |
| 19:13      | And I love the way that that card specifically looks.                              |
| 19:16      | And so that's why the ones I've got on my home screen.                             |
| 19:19      | And I do like that, but I also like just having the ability                        |
| 19:22      | to pop into an entire deck and just see all of my stuff there                      |
| 19:26      | because I don't, I'm not looking for one specific card.                            |
| 19:30      | I don't necessarily care about the weather information, but I                      |
| 19:34      | like just, you know, absorbing the information that, oh yeah,                      |
| 19:37      | and it's raining outside.                                                          |
| 19:39      | You know, as I go about my day when I'm looking to see, okay,                      |
| 19:42      | well, my calendar says this and my task management system says                     |
| 19:45      | this.                                                                              |
| 19:46      | And also, you know, in my shopping list, I have all these                          |
| 19:48      | things that I need to buy.                                                         |
| 19:49      | Oh, and it is this date today, which means that, you know,                         |
| 19:52      | this is coming up and stuff like that.                                             |
| 19:54      | So, you know, I am enjoying the widgets, but that's not                            |
| 19:59      | necessarily my primary use case, but I can see for a lot of                        |
| 20:02      | people, it would be, for example, your, your office                                |
| 20:05      | shortcut where you display the different lights in your office                     |
| 20:07      | and what's on and what's off.                                                      |
| 20:09      | That is something I desperately need to steal and figure out                       |
| 20:11      | how that works.                                                                    |
| 20:12      | And so that I can set it up because I also have a lot of                           |
| 20:15      | lights here in my office and I would love to know what's on                        |
| 20:18      | and off, you know, when I'm in here.                                               |
| 20:20      | And that would be great on my home screen.                                         |
| 20:22      | Okay, so let's talk about that for a minute.                                       |
| 20:24      | You've got this cool widget you made that spatially displays                       |
| 20:28      | the light bulbs for the lights in your office and you can                          |
| 20:32      | turn them off individually, as I understand it, within the                         |
| 20:36      | widget.                                                                            |
| 20:37      | How did you do that?                                                               |
| 20:38      | So this is based on MSDX kind of hard result JSON object.                          |
| 20:42      | So it's a way for shortcut developers to specify how the                           |
| 20:46      | widget looks.                                                                      |
| 20:47      | So in the case of the office status widget, I'm getting the                        |
| 20:50      | home kit status of six of the lights in my office.                                 |
| 20:54      | Actually, let me see.                                                              |
| 20:55      | One, two, three, four, five, six, yeah, six lights.                                |
| 20:58      | And I give it up an FS symbol, which is like either the light                      |
| 21:02      | on or the light, a light bulb with a slash through it.                             |
| 21:05      | And then I can define a link to each of those little                               |
| 21:09      | graphics.                                                                          |
| 21:10      | And then when I tap on the link, I can send a command to                           |
| 21:13      | another shortcut, which would do something like turn on the                        |
| 21:15      | light or toggle the light.                                                         |
| 21:18      | Yeah, so the widget's really about status more than it's                           |
| 21:20      | actually controlling the light.                                                    |
| 21:22      | Then you're using a link to a traditional shortcut to toggle                       |
| 21:26      | the light.                                                                         |
| 21:27      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 21:28      | But I think that's where the brilliance of all of this is                          |
| 21:30      | because you don't need to learn how to program in a different                      |
| 21:34      | way.                                                                               |
| 21:35      | Do you?                                                                            |
| 21:36      | You're using the programming that we're all already familiar                       |
| 21:39      | with, which is shortcuts, and just giving us a couple of                           |
| 21:43      | different ways to display that.                                                    |
| 21:45      | And I have to say, it took me a little while to wrap my head                       |
| 21:47      | around displaying some of the information through the JSON                         |
| 21:50      | format because I needed examples.                                                  |
| 21:54      | And the one that I stole as my base for a lot of shortcuts is                      |
| 21:59      | the weather one, because I really like how you've got the                          |
| 22:02      | gradient background there.                                                         |
| 22:04      | You've got the name of the place at the top, and then you've                       |
| 22:06      | got the temperature in large letters.                                              |
| 22:08      | You've got an SF symbol in there and then some more                                |
| 22:10      | information.                                                                       |
| 22:11      | And that, to me, I looked at that and went, OK, I can see                          |
| 22:14      | from this widget what I could do to create a whole bunch of                        |
| 22:18      | others in MFC Deck.                                                                |
| 22:20      | And I've been playing from there.                                                  |
| 22:21      | And some of my results have been less successful than others.                      |
| 22:24      | It turns out that I'm not great at remembering different                           |
| 22:26      | colours for hex codes off the top of my head.                                       |
| 22:28      | So at one point I had a very unreadable bright green or                            |
| 22:31      | bright yellow widget.                                                              |
| 22:33      | That was not at all what I was intending because I was                             |
| 22:36      | playing with that.                                                                 |
| 22:38      | But now I am getting somewhere and I managed to go back to                         |
| 22:42      | black on yellow, which was what I was originally intending to                      |
| 22:45      | do.                                                                                |
| 22:46      | Don't ask me how I ended up with green because black                               |
| 22:48      | is the easiest colour to remember, but there we go.                                 |
| 22:51      | It's OK, Rose, it happens.                                                         |
| 22:53      | Well, I'm a web developer.                                                         |
| 22:55      | I'm supposed to remember some of these things, but apparently                      |
| 22:57      | I was having a very off day because I don't know what.                             |
| 22:59      | Maybe I was just thinking that I would change the background                       |
| 23:02      | colour to green and I just put it in the wrong thing.                               |
| 23:04      | I don't know what happened there.                                                  |
| 23:06      | It looked terrible.                                                                |
| 23:07      | It was not readable.                                                               |
| 23:08      | And I've got great eyesight when I'm wearing my glasses or                         |
| 23:10      | contact lenses, but at least it was me that screwed that up.                       |
| 23:14      | Adam, so now that this is in the wild, you can download and                        |
| 23:17      | install MFC deck right now as you're listening to the show.                        |
| 23:21      | What are some of the interesting uses you've seen some of your                     |
| 23:24      | users doing with MFC deck?                                                         |
| 23:28      | That's a good question.                                                            |
| 23:30      | So honestly, I haven't heard too much from the outside people                      |
| 23:34      | how they're using it.                                                              |
| 23:36      | So I've been trying to get more people to talk about it.                           |
| 23:40      | So I know, Rosemary, you mentioned it with [[Matthew Cassinelli]]                      |
| 23:43      | the other day.                                                                     |
| 23:44      | Yep.                                                                               |
| 23:45      | Thank you for doing that.                                                          |
| 23:46      | I'd actually like to see people kind of posting screenshots of                     |
| 23:49      | their decks and their cards and the types of things that                           |
| 23:52      | they're doing.                                                                     |
| 23:53      | Honestly, there's like a lot of talk right now with widget pack                    |
| 23:56      | and Scriptable widgets.                                                            |
| 23:58      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 23:59      | And those are fantastic products too.                                              |
| 24:02      | I think the problem with MFC deck is that it does so many                          |
| 24:05      | different things that it's hard for people to kind of wrap                         |
| 24:08      | their heads around what can it do for me.                                          |
| 24:11      | And so I think part of what I've done with the MFC deck                            |
| 24:14      | shortcut gallery is to kind of show all the different ways you                     |
| 24:18      | can use it.                                                                        |
| 24:19      | And I started also posting to my YouTube channel,                                  |
| 24:22      | tutorial videos on how you can use the app and show you                            |
| 24:26      | step-by-step how I'm doing certain things within MFC deck.                         |
| 24:29      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 24:30      | I do think that like there's this little nugget of gold here                       |
| 24:33      | for automators that has not been, just a lot of people haven't                     |
| 24:37      | got it.                                                                            |
| 24:38      | And honestly, one of the reasons I wanted to book you on the                       |
| 24:40      | show is because I wanted to force myself to dig in with the                        |
| 24:43      | app because I didn't really understand it either until we                          |
| 24:46      | started really kind of prepping for the show.                                      |
| 24:48      | And there's just a lot here for people.                                            |
| 24:50      | And, you know, it's very reasonably priced and it adds a                           |
| 24:54      | bunch of power features to shortcuts.                                              |
| 24:56      | So why wouldn't you want that?                                                     |
| 24:58      | And I think one of the things you've done recently that is                         |
| 25:01      | really great.                                                                      |
| 25:02      | Like you said, you've got this YouTube channel and you're putting                  |
| 25:04      | all this content.                                                                  |
| 25:05      | You have a crack marketing executive that makes an appearance                      |
| 25:08      | and so on.                                                                         |
| 25:09      | I love that guy.                                                                   |
| 25:10      | But you're making these great videos and we're going to link                       |
| 25:13      | a bunch of them in the show notes.                                                 |
| 25:14      | So if you're listening and you have any interest, I recommend                      |
| 25:17      | you watch those videos because they kind of walk you through                       |
| 25:20      | how Adam has created some of these.                                                |
| 25:22      | Well, let me rephrase the earlier question.                                        |
| 25:24      | So tell me some of the ways that you're using MFC deck to do                       |
| 25:28      | interesting things.                                                                |
| 25:29      | Sure.                                                                              |
| 25:30      | So let me pull up my device right here.                                            |
| 25:33      | I have dirt.                                                                       |
| 25:35      | So in the morning, when I wake up, I have the weather deck set                     |
| 25:39      | as the current deck.                                                               |
| 25:41      | So when I wake up and I open up MFC deck, it shows me weather                      |
| 25:44      | conditions for all areas around the world that I'm interested in.                  |
| 25:48      | One of the things that I'm most interested in is the air quality                   |
| 25:50      | index.                                                                             |
| 25:51      | So as you know, David, we were, we live in California and there's                  |
| 25:54      | a lot of wildfires earlier this year.                                              |
| 25:56      | So I had the AQI as one of the things that I displayed in my                       |
| 26:00      | weather, my weather cards.                                                         |
| 26:02      | So I knew that if, if it was really bad, it was like over 100,                     |
| 26:05      | it's probably not a good idea to go out for a walk or go out                       |
| 26:08      | for a run.                                                                         |
| 26:10      | The primary deck that I have also shows other information that I                   |
| 26:14      | use throughout the day, such as I make a lot of screenshots                        |
| 26:18      | naturally when I'm developing apps.                                                |
| 26:20      | So I have a, a car that just runs this shortcut that basically                     |
| 26:25      | takes an iOS screenshot and turns, puts the iPhone frame around                    |
| 26:29      | it.                                                                                |
| 26:30      | I have a clipboard deck, which I use.                                              |
| 26:33      | So I make the deck, the clipboard deck, the default deck, and                      |
| 26:37      | then I just set it down on my, on my table.                                        |
| 26:41      | And then if I'm writing documentation, I frequently have to                        |
| 26:44      | make a kind of like a markdown header into a slug.                                 |
| 26:48      | So I can have a link to it.                                                        |
| 26:50      | So all I have to do is tap the slug card and it will go take the                   |
| 26:54      | contents of the clipboard, convert it into a slug and then paste                   |
| 26:58      | it back into the clipboard.                                                        |
| 27:00      | And then on my Mac, where I'm using to actually type my                            |
| 27:02      | documentation, all I have to do is hit command V to paste that                     |
| 27:05      | slug back into my document.                                                        |
| 27:07      | Is it using handoff to share the contents of the clipboard?                        |
| 27:11      | We already talked about [[NFC]] tags.                                                  |
| 27:13      | And so I have a whole bunch of NFC tags around the house.                          |
| 27:17      | And so I can program them through and through [[MFC deck]] instead of                  |
| 27:22      | having to go through the automation tab within [[Shortcuts]],                          |
| 27:25      | which is very busy and complicated.                                                |
| 27:28      | And I can control what NFC tag, what shortcut is run whenever I                    |
| 27:34      | want an NFC tag, depending on what deck that I'm currently in.                     |
| 27:37      | I have a bunch of other decks that control Mac app.                                |
| 27:40      | So if I'm in the zoom app, which we're all in these days,                          |
| 27:43      | you know, I can quickly mute and unmute or turn on and off my                      |
| 27:47      | video from my iOS device.                                                          |
| 27:49      | Can I interrupt? How are you doing that?                                           |
| 27:51      | So there's two ways that you can do that.                                          |
| 27:53      | So I have a shortcut on the MFC deck shortcut gallery,                             |
| 27:57      | which uses the [[SSH]] command.                                                        |
| 27:59      | So it basically you give it your credentials to your Mac and then                  |
| 28:03      | sends an [[AppleScript]] to your Mac,                                                 |
| 28:05      | which then tells zoom to mute or unmute.                                           |
| 28:09      | So it sends a key command.                                                         |
| 28:11      | The other method is to use something like [[Keyboard Maestro]] and                     |
| 28:15      | to use their kind of remote web trigger,                                           |
| 28:17      | which then basically sends a URL to Keyboard Maestro's kind of                     |
| 28:21      | server, which then talks to [[Keyboard Maestro]] on your Mac to                        |
| 28:25      | mute and unmute.                                                                   |
| 28:26      | And that that method is much faster.                                               |
| 28:28      | It's pretty much instantaneous versus the SSH method takes maybe                   |
| 28:32      | a couple seconds to do the action.                                                 |
| 28:36      | So if you want kind of like instant,                                               |
| 28:40      | I am doing this just like I'm doing it on my Mac,                                  |
| 28:43      | probably the [[Keyboard Maestro]] method is the best.                                  |
| 28:46      | If you don't care as much,                                                         |
| 28:48      | then the SSH version would work for you.                                           |
| 28:52      | And this is interesting because it's like,                                         |
| 28:54      | it's almost like creating your own iOS based [[Stream Deck]] to                        |
| 28:59      | control your Mac.                                                                  |
| 29:00      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 29:01      | You could also actually,                                                           |
| 29:02      | if you have like a push cut automation server that's running                       |
| 29:05      | on a dedicated device,                                                             |
| 29:08      | you can actually have a bunch of cards that act as push cut buttons.               |
| 29:13      | So you could,                                                                      |
| 29:14      | you can set the card action to be like ping this URL and that                      |
| 29:18      | URL is the push cut action.                                                        |
| 29:20      | So then you can create a little [[Stream Deck]] for your,                              |
| 29:23      | you know, your dedicated push cut device.                                          |
| 29:25      | That's really smart because you also have the ability to grab                      |
| 29:29      | [[Data Jar]] information, don't you,                                                   |
| 29:31      | to display in a widget,                                                            |
| 29:35      | which I have been experimenting with a little bit                                  |
| 29:38      | because I thought it would be really smart if,                                     |
| 29:40      | you know, just as stuff happens.                                                   |
| 29:43      | So for example, when lights come on,                                               |
| 29:45      | they can ping my push cut server and then,                                         |
| 29:47      | you know, that will automatically log.                                             |
| 29:49      | Hey, that, you know, like this,                                                    |
| 29:51      | this thing has been on for three hours or whatever it is.                          |
| 29:54      | So I know when it turned on.                                                       |
| 29:56      | So I'm thinking specifically of my lava lamp,                                      |
| 29:58      | my lava lamp's not supposed to be on for more than eight hours.                    |
| 30:00      | So I'd like to know when it turned on so that,                                     |
| 30:02      | you know, if something goes wrong,                                                 |
| 30:03      | I still turn it off manually.                                                      |
| 30:05      | And so being able to grab that information.                                        |
| 30:08      | Ooh, you've, you've given me some more ideas there Adam.                           |
| 30:10      | I'm really glad we're having you on the show for this.                             |
| 30:13      | It's personal tech support with a heavy automation twist,                          |
| 30:16      | which I'm much appreciating.                                                       |
| 30:18      | So another thing that I've,                                                        |
| 30:19      | that I use with MSC deck is automation.                                            |
| 30:21      | So I created this shortcut that's called background automations.                   |
| 30:24      | And what it does is it creates a background event trigger on your device.          |
| 30:29      | So right now you can create time of day automations that run automatically         |
| 30:34      | or you have an open app automation.                                                |
| 30:36      | But what this one does is it lets you create an interval automation.               |
| 30:40      | So that runs anywhere between 10 and 90 seconds                                    |
| 30:43      | and it will just run shortcuts continually.                                        |
| 30:45      | So you could kick this off and then have shortcuts run every,                      |
| 30:50      | you know, 15, 30 seconds.                                                          |
| 30:52      | That's going set to 90 seconds.                                                    |
| 30:54      | And you can be in another app and then you're,                                     |
| 30:57      | whatever shortcut you want to run automatically or a deck or a card,               |
| 31:01      | it will just happen in the background.                                             |
| 31:03      | Clever, clever.                                                                    |
| 31:04      | Well, I mean, it's so MFC deck really does a lot.                                  |
| 31:08      | And I think that is the blessing in the curse of the app.                          |
| 31:11      | I think a lot of people haven't discovered it for exactly the reason you said      |
| 31:14      | they're not sure where to start.                                                   |
| 31:16      | And I'm telling you where to start.                                                |
| 31:18      | Go to Adam's YouTube channel and just watch them up as you tubes.                  |
| 31:22      | And there's so many different avenues of this app.                                 |
| 31:25      | You can go down.                                                                   |
| 31:26      | Let's say that you're really into NFC tags.                                        |
| 31:29      | Well, you can kind of repurpose NFC tags in shortcuts,                             |
| 31:34      | but it's a big pain in the neck.                                                   |
| 31:36      | But with MFC deck, it's actually really easy.                                      |
| 31:39      | So that might be your avenue or maybe you want to build your own like contextual   |
| 31:44      | cards based on time of day.                                                        |
| 31:46      | It can do that too.                                                                |
| 31:47      | Watch the videos gang and go in and do it.                                         |
| 31:51      | And when you make something cool, share with Adam,                                 |
| 31:53      | he needs to hear from people, man.                                                 |
| 31:55      | This guy's been working hard on this app.                                          |
| 31:57      | There's a set form in our forums actually for MFC deck or there should be.         |
| 32:02      | I think they're creating one.                                                      |
| 32:04      | So if you haven't yet posted about it, then you could also post about it there.    |
| 32:10      | So you can download MFC deck right now from the app store.                         |
| 32:13      | It's a free trial.                                                                 |
| 32:14      | If you want to get the premium version, it's $5.                                   |
| 32:18      | It's not that expensive to get in and get all the features out of this app.        |
| 32:22      | So go check it out.                                                                |
| 32:24      | And Rosemary and I are both using it as well.                                      |
| 32:27      | For me, the angle for it really is I'm super into the idea of contextual based     |
| 32:33      | computing, getting my devices to go where I want them to as soon as possible.      |
| 32:38      | And MFC deck is going to play a role in that I'm still kind of sorting it out,     |
| 32:42      | but it really is a nice work piece of work there.                                  |
| 32:46      | Adam, thank you for making this great.                                             |
| 32:48      | Thanks.                                                                            |
| 32:49      | All right, we're going to take a quick break, but we got a whole bunch more        |
| 32:51      | automation to talk with Adam about.                                                |
| 32:54      | This episode of the automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                    |
| 32:58      | Go to expressvpn.com/automators to get three free months of high speed,      |
| 33:03      | secure and anonymous VPN services.                                                 |
| 33:06      | So how do you choose which internet service provider to use?                       |
| 33:10      | The sad thing is most of us have very little choice because ISPs have a lot of     |
| 33:15      | control in the regions where they serve.                                           |
| 33:17      | They can use this control to take advantage of customers, data caps,               |
| 33:21      | streaming throttles, the list goes on.                                             |
| 33:23      | But worst of all, many ISPs log your internet activity and sell that data          |
| 33:29      | onto other big tech companies or advertisers.                                      |
| 33:32      | I hate that.                                                                       |
| 33:34      | So I protect all of my devices with ExpressVPN, which means ISPs can't see         |
| 33:39      | my internet activity.                                                              |
| 33:41      | So what is ExpressVPN?                                                             |
| 33:43      | It's a simple app for your computer or smartphone that encrypts all of your        |
| 33:47      | network data and tunnels it through the secure VPN server at ExpressVPN.           |
| 33:53      | So your ISP can't see your activity.                                               |
| 33:56      | Just think about how much of your life is on the internet.                         |
| 33:59      | Every site you visit, video you watch or message you send gets tracked by          |
| 34:03      | ISPs or other tech giants who can then sell your information for profit.           |
| 34:08      | That's the reason I recommend ExpressVPN is the best way to hide your              |
| 34:12      | online activity from your ISP.                                                     |
| 34:14      | You just download the app, tap one button on your device and you're protected.     |
| 34:18      | And ExpressVPN does all of that without slowing your connection.                   |
| 34:22      | That's why it's rated the number one VPN service by CNET and Wired.                |
| 34:26      | And that's why it's the one I use and personally subscribe to.                     |
| 34:29      | I've been using ExpressVPN for years.                                              |
| 34:32      | Every year when my renewal comes up, I pay it without question and I just          |
| 34:36      | keep it turned on.                                                                 |
| 34:37      | It's so easy to use, you click one button and it's on.                             |
| 34:40      | And I trust ExpressVPN to protect my privacy.                                      |
| 34:43      | So stop handing over your personal data to ISPs and other tech giants who          |
| 34:47      | mind your activity and sell your information.                                      |
| 34:50      | Protect yourself with the VPN I trust to keep me private online.                   |

| 35:15      | So Adam, I understand you're a big home automation guy and you have                |
| 35:21      | drunk from the pool of Homebridge.                                                 |
| 35:24      | I only installed Homebridge after watching your listening to your                  |
| 35:28      | episode a few weeks ago.                                                           |
| 35:30      | Okay, so you're new to how's it going?                                             |
| 35:33      | It's going very well.                                                              |
| 35:35      | So I have a bunch of [[HomeKit]] power devices, lights, and I bought some              |
| 35:39      | motion sensors and other things, but I always felt it was very lacking.            |
| 35:44      | I couldn't do some of the things until I learned about Homebridge.                 |
| 35:47      | And now I'm like going all wild on virtual switches, using the                     |
| 35:51      | CRON plugins and timer plugins to do things that I couldn't do in the              |
| 35:55      | past.                                                                              |
| 35:56      | So for instance, you can create like a virtual switch that pings                   |
| 36:01      | information from a web kind of web database, whether it's like air                 |
| 36:06      | table or [jsonbin.io](https://jsonbin.io).                                                               |
| 36:09      | And then other people can hit that air table database or that [[JSONBin]]              |
| 36:14      | object and then flip a switch in my house.                                         |
| 36:17      | Right.                                                                             |
| 36:18      | And then because I have home and [[HomeKit]] automation, I can do                      |
| 36:21      | something whenever that switch gets flipped.                                       |
| 36:24      | So I'm not using that actually right now in any kind of production                 |
| 36:28      | environment, but it's just something that's not...                                 |
| 36:31      | I was going to say, letting other people turn your lights on and off               |
| 36:34      | sounds like potentially something that might not be the best idea.                 |
| 36:37      | But I can definitely see the advantages of it.                                     |
| 36:40      | I've been experimenting with trying to get some specific weather data in           |
| 36:45      | and having if this, then that poke a HTTP switch on my Homebridge                  |
| 36:50      | server to turn on my kitchen light when it's super cloudy outside.                 |
| 36:54      | Right.                                                                             |
| 36:55      | So here's an example that I am using.                                              |
| 36:57      | One of these virtual switches for.                                                 |
| 36:58      | So in [[HomeKit]], you can have an automation run when someone leaves                  |
| 37:03      | or arrives at a house.                                                             |
| 37:04      | So I just have a very simple one that flips the switch that says                   |
| 37:08      | Adam is home or my wife is home or that there's people in the house                |
| 37:11      | whenever one of us arrives or leaves.                                              |
| 37:13      | Right.                                                                             |
| 37:14      | And so now when I'm out and about, I don't have to go in to find my                |
| 37:18      | friends and look at whether my wife is home.                                       |
| 37:21      | I can just ask using Siri is so and so home.                                       |
| 37:25      | And then it will look at the content of that, the state of that                    |
| 37:28      | virtual switch.                                                                    |
| 37:29      | If it's on the person's home, off the person's not at home.                        |
| 37:32      | That is ingenious.                                                                 |
| 37:34      | Oh my gosh, Adam.                                                                  |
| 37:35      | Wow.                                                                               |
| 37:36      | That is so cool.                                                                   |
| 37:37      | So there's another one.                                                            |
| 37:38      | There's like, there's a cron, a cron plugin for Homebridge.                        |
| 37:43      | So a cron lets you kind of run stuff on a, on a repeating basis                    |
| 37:47      | like every minute or every hour.                                                   |
| 37:49      | And so I have these hue lights.                                                    |
| 37:51      | So I want to change the colours of the lights every minute.                         |
| 37:55      | Right.                                                                             |
| 37:56      | And you can do that with some, there's some kind of add-ons to                     |
| 37:59      | the hue and hue labs, but it kind of slows down the whole                          |
| 38:02      | Homebridge I found.                                                                |
| 38:05      | So I have this cron switch that flips the switch.                                  |
| 38:10      | And then whenever that switch is flipped, it just changes the                      |
| 38:12      | colour of one of my lights.                                                         |
| 38:14      | And are you using that to, to simulate sort of the, the ambient                    |
| 38:18      | lighting or whatever it is called adaptive lighting.                               |
| 38:21      | That's what the, the new home feature is called.                                   |
| 38:23      | Are you using it to do a better version of that or just                            |
| 38:25      | different colours?                                                                  |
| 38:27      | Yeah, it's just different colours.                                                  |
| 38:28      | So I have one of these hue bloom lights, which very vibrant                        |
| 38:32      | colour.                                                                             |
| 38:33      | So I just have it set to change the lights.                                        |
| 38:35      | So when you're watching my video, you can see like the background                  |
| 38:37      | changing.                                                                          |
| 38:38      | Right.                                                                             |
| 38:39      | And I don't have to like do anything about it.                                     |
| 38:41      | That's really nice.                                                                |
| 38:42      | I like that idea.                                                                  |
| 38:43      | I have the Nanoleaf light panels on the wall in my living room.                   |
| 38:46      | And those are great.                                                               |
| 38:48      | But I'd like to automatically switch between certain scenes.                       |
| 38:52      | And now you're, you're making me think that that might be a                        |
| 38:56      | cool way of doing it because obviously I could program my                          |
| 38:59      | own scene and there's a playlist in the Nanoleaf app and so                       |
| 39:02      | on.                                                                                |
| 39:03      | But I think it would be nice just to have it automatically go                      |
| 39:05      | ping.                                                                              |
| 39:06      | Okay.                                                                              |
| 39:07      | Next one, ping.                                                                    |
| 39:08      | Next one.                                                                          |
| 39:09      | While the light is on when the lights off, then I presume I can                    |
| 39:11      | set it up to not do anything because you still got all the                         |
| 39:13      | home kit goodness while you're using Homebridge, of course.                       |
| 39:17      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 39:18      | Rose, every since we talked about Nanoleaf on the show, I'm                       |
| 39:20      | getting bombed like one email a day from people who own nano                       |
| 39:24      | leaves who think I should buy them.                                                |
| 39:26      | You should.                                                                        |
| 39:27      | You guys should stop writing me.                                                   |
| 39:29      | This is not helping.                                                               |
| 39:30      | Are you concerned about, about Daisy and the sudden appearance                     |
| 39:35      | of nano leaves in your house and her happiness level with that                     |
| 39:37      | or.                                                                                |
| 39:38      | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                |
| 39:39      | I just feel like that's, that's a kind of slippery slope I                         |
| 39:42      | would start going down and suddenly they'd show up everywhere.                     |
| 39:45      | Okay.                                                                              |
| 39:46      | I don't know if I could stop myself.                                               |
| 39:47      | Well, I mean, if you checked your messages thread recently,                        |
| 39:49      | then you'll have seen the small pile of home kit devices that                      |
| 39:51      | arrived for me the other day after I said on the show that I'm                     |
| 39:54      | done.                                                                              |
| 39:55      | It's good.                                                                         |
| 39:56      | Everything's fine.                                                                 |
| 39:57      | It's fine.                                                                         |
| 39:58      | I'm just automating, opening and closing my curtains with                          |
| 40:00      | switch bar.                                                                        |
| 40:01      | It's fine.                                                                         |
| 40:02      | Don't worry about it, people.                                                      |
| 40:03      | It's all good.                                                                     |
| 40:04      | So, so Adam, what is the, you know, what are some of your                          |
| 40:07      | favourite home automation like routines that you use?                               |
| 40:11      | Like, I know that, you know, you've got other people you live                      |
| 40:13      | with.                                                                              |
| 40:14      | So you've got to make automations that are friendly to nest,                       |
| 40:16      | not necessarily geeks, but work for the entire household.                          |
| 40:20      | But also, I know you're a very clever guy.                                         |
| 40:22      | So I'd be curious to hear what you're doing with home                              |
| 40:24      | automations.                                                                       |
| 40:25      | Most of the people in the house, they know how to turn on and                      |
| 40:27      | off the lights with, they're not, they know not to flip the                        |
| 40:31      | switches, you know, in terms of automations, I have, honestly,                     |
| 40:36      | it's basically very simple.                                                        |
| 40:38      | So I have automations that turn on and off the lights.                             |
| 40:41      | They change our outside lights to kind of like holiday lights                      |
| 40:44      | these days.                                                                        |
| 40:46      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 40:47      | We're home most of the time.                                                       |
| 40:49      | So a lot of the automations that, that are triggered, like when                    |
| 40:51      | people leave and stuff, aren't really relevant anymore.                            |
| 40:54      | A lot of automations that I have are kind of like in my                            |
| 40:56      | office.                                                                            |
| 40:57      | So again, changing lights when I'm doing, making videos.                           |
| 41:02      | It is very simple kind of my automations with home.                                |
| 41:05      | I'm still kind of experimenting.                                                   |
| 41:07      | I don't have things like automatic blinds like you have,                           |
| 41:11      | Rosemary, I wish I had automatic blinds.                                           |
| 41:13      | They are amazing.                                                                  |
| 41:15      | I have to say, I set my parents up with automatic blinds                           |
| 41:18      | recently.                                                                          |
| 41:19      | And so they've got three blinds in the three upstairs rooms.                       |
| 41:23      | The one that my mom's currently using is the office, their room                    |
| 41:25      | and the spare room, which until recently until like all my                         |
| 41:27      | place I was staying in.                                                            |
| 41:29      | And it's great.                                                                    |
| 41:31      | So I set it up.                                                                    |
| 41:32      | So they automatically close at 9 30 at night.                                      |
| 41:34      | If nobody's at home, they automatically open at eight in                           |
| 41:36      | the morning.                                                                       |
| 41:37      | And then when they open the bedroom blind, it opens the                            |
| 41:39      | other blinds because my mom said, oh, we don't really like                         |
| 41:42      | this automation stuff.                                                             |
| 41:43      | And I think that's just because I gave them an Eve energy                          |
| 41:45      | plug before and they're, and it's Bluetooth based and their                        |
| 41:48      | Apple TV was not working as a home get hub spoiler people.                         |
| 41:51      | You need to update the Apple TV if you want it to work as a                        |
| 41:54      | good home care hub.                                                                |
| 41:55      | If you don't update it, it just doesn't work.                                      |
| 41:57      | So, you know, they told me they don't really like                                  |
| 42:00      | automation.                                                                        |
| 42:01      | So under the Christmas tree, there are two smart plugs with                        |
| 42:03      | a with a with a button so they can turn on and off some lights                     |
| 42:07      | that they automatically that they usually turn on in the                           |
| 42:09      | evenings and they'll be able to home get that because those                        |
| 42:11      | were IKEA ones.                                                                    |
| 42:12      | And they also have a Sonos one and an Echo Dot because I                           |
| 42:18      | figured those are relatively easy gateway drugs for them                           |
| 42:22      | without necessarily, at least in the Echo Dot case, the                            |
| 42:25      | overhead of the HomePod mini.                                                      |
| 42:27      | And in my case, the Sonos one is actually from my bedroom.                         |
| 42:30      | They're aware it's it was originally mine.                                         |
| 42:32      | But I'm hoping that the good speaker will get them                                 |
| 42:36      | interested in this stuff a little bit more.                                        |
| 42:38      | So one thing that I don't know where you live and how good                         |
| 42:41      | your Internet is, but where I live in the Bay Area, you'd                          |
| 42:44      | be surprised that we don't have Fios where I live and that                         |
| 42:47      | the Internet, the uploads fees are actually quite slow.                            |
| 42:50      | So I have three Logitech circle lights.                                            |
| 42:54      | Sorry, Logitech circle cameras.                                                    |
| 42:56      | And so, but if I have them all on, it sucks my Internet.                           |
| 43:00      | It like completely takes over my Internet because it's sending                     |
| 43:03      | all that video data back to Logitech.                                              |
| 43:05      | Wow.                                                                               |
| 43:06      | So I have these automations that turn on my cameras through                        |
| 43:10      | a Wemo switch or, you know, a smart switch.                                       |
| 43:13      | It turns them on at certain times of the day.                                      |
| 43:15      | So when I'm working, I want, I don't want my cameras on                            |
| 43:18      | because it'll just take up all my bandwidth.                                       |
| 43:21      | Right.                                                                             |
| 43:22      | And so I turn them off, but then, you know, later in the day                       |
| 43:24      | when I'm not working, it'll turn the switches on and then                          |
| 43:27      | the cameras will become active.                                                    |
| 43:29      | That's really smart.                                                               |
| 43:30      | I have a, I have a dummy switch in Homebridge, which is                            |
| 43:34      | called working.                                                                    |
| 43:35      | And basically that's just to identify that that's what I'm                         |
| 43:38      | currently doing.                                                                   |
| 43:39      | And I'm adding a few more.                                                         |
| 43:40      | So I've got podcasting as well and things like that.                               |
| 43:42      | And it's basically just to identify, hey, I'm doing this                           |
| 43:45      | kind of thing.                                                                     |
| 43:46      | Therefore, you know, take note of that.                                            |
| 43:49      | So while I'm working, it shouldn't be doing things like                            |
| 43:51      | turning on the heater and the electric blanket in my bedroom.                      |
| 43:54      | Same while I'm podcasting.                                                         |
| 43:56      | But, you know, while I'm lodging in the living room in the                         |
| 43:59      | evening, it should absolutely go, oh yeah, I'm going to ask                        |
| 44:03      | now if you're going to be going to bed.                                            |
| 44:05      | And if you are going to bed, then I'm going to, you know,                          |
| 44:07      | turn on the heater and the electric blanket so that you're                         |
| 44:09      | not too cold.                                                                      |
| 44:10      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 44:11      | You know, and it's funny because people don't think about the                      |
| 44:13      | fact that, you know, putting three home video cameras in my                        |
| 44:17      | house is going to kill my internet.                                                |
| 44:19      | It's just not like normally those wires aren't connected in                        |
| 44:24      | the screen, but that's absolutely what can happen,                                 |
| 44:27      | especially with these camera companies that want to be the                         |
| 44:30      | host of the data.                                                                  |
| 44:31      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 44:32      | I mean, I don't know if you've taken a look at like, if you                        |
| 44:34      | have like an Eero or some type of Wi-Fi router that shows you                      |
| 44:38      | all the connected devices, there are a lot of connected devices                    |
| 44:41      | in our house.                                                                      |
| 44:42      | And who knows how much data they're like sending out to the                        |
| 44:45      | internet, you know, and taking just that little slice of bandwidth                 |
| 44:49      | and so it just adds up such that your bandwidth is just                            |
| 44:52      | slows to a crawl.                                                                  |
| 44:53      | Yeah, it does.                                                                     |
| 44:54      | But at the same time, it means that I've got the HomeCam app                       |
| 44:57      | here open on my desk and it's just showing me the cameras on                       |
| 45:01      | my two entrances.                                                                  |
| 45:02      | So if I do hear a funny noise again while I'm podcasting,                          |
| 45:05      | which happened once before, then I'll be able to say, well,                        |
| 45:08      | you know, that's just something that's fallen down somewhere                       |
| 45:10      | instead of I think there's somebody in my house.                                   |
| 45:12      | Obviously there was nobody in my house last time and                               |
| 45:14      | everything was fine.                                                               |
| 45:15      | But, you know, I heard a funny noise while I was podcasting                        |
| 45:18      | and I didn't feel like it easily just get up and go, what's                        |
| 45:21      | happening?                                                                         |
| 45:22      | So it can be useful.                                                               |
| 45:24      | Adam, another thing that I know you have some expertise on is                      |
| 45:28      | [[Apple Mail]] plugins.                                                                |
| 45:29      | I know this is a complete kind of left turn in the conversation,                   |
| 45:32      | but automation with respect to email is always a challenge.                        |
| 45:37      | I was bemoaning on a recent episode of Mac Power users how,                        |
| 45:41      | you know, the state general state of Apple Mail plugins.                           |
| 45:44      | And I guess you've got some knowledge on this.                                     |
| 45:46      | I do.                                                                              |
| 45:47      | I have a mail plugin that I've been developing for over a                          |
| 45:50      | decade now called Message Filer.                                                   |
| 45:52      | Oh, that's right.                                                                  |
| 45:54      | I knew that.                                                                       |
| 45:55      | Yes.                                                                               |
| 45:56      | The Message Filer lets you file messages in macOS mail using                       |
| 46:00      | your keyboard.                                                                     |
| 46:01      | I totally forgot you did that too.                                                 |
| 46:03      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 46:04      | Okay.                                                                              |
| 46:05      | So yeah, it does a, it's a filing action.                                          |
| 46:09      | It is.                                                                             |
| 46:10      | So it's, I wouldn't call it automated, it's semi-automated                         |
| 46:13      | since you still have to type in the mailbox name.                                  |
| 46:16      | But there are some shortcuts if you have favourite mailboxes                        |
| 46:19      | that you'd like to file to.                                                        |
| 46:21      | And so, you know, when you, when you, when I read that thing                       |
| 46:23      | or listened to bemoaning, you know, the state of mail plugins,                     |
| 46:26      | I intimately know about that because every year whenever                           |
| 46:29      | [[Apple]] releases a new version of macOS, all plugins break,                          |
| 46:33      | there's like a little tweak that they make to the mail app that                    |
| 46:36      | causes all mail plugin developers to have to like rewrite                          |
| 46:39      | just a small bit of, or maybe a large portion of their,                            |
| 46:42      | of their app.                                                                      |
| 46:43      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 46:44      | And it seems like that's true not with the major updates,                          |
| 46:48      | like the, you know, the yearly updates, but even the point updates                 |
| 46:51      | break all the mail plugins routinely.                                              |
| 46:53      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 46:54      | So, so the way that works is that there's this compatibility                       |
| 46:58      | UUID, so it's a unique identifier, which they update                               |
| 47:01      | every time a new kind of point release comes out.                                  |
| 47:04      | And so there's no real change that needs to be made to the                         |
| 47:07      | plugins other than adding this little ID into, into the app                        |
| 47:11      | that says, Hey, I can work on this version of macOS.                               |
| 47:15      | But the problem is that they, they keep, you know, either                          |
| 47:18      | changing the UUID or changing this one little field that has                       |
| 47:21      | the exact same value as the previous UUID, but because you                         |
| 47:25      | have to update the plugin, you have to go through the whole                        |
| 47:29      | process of verifying with apples because now plugins need to                       |
| 47:33      | be signed and yada, yada, yada.                                                    |
| 47:35      | And so every, all your, you know, customers have to go                             |
| 47:38      | download the new plugins.                                                          |
| 47:39      | So you get field of these requests, you know, I just                               |
| 47:41      | upgraded to macOS and now my plugin doesn't work.                                  |
| 47:43      | What do I do?                                                                      |
| 47:44      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 47:45      | It is really frustrating.                                                          |
| 47:47      | I do think the reason why Apple Mail hasn't got a lot of                           |
| 47:50      | new features is I think [[Apple]] has been really focused on                           |
| 47:53      | security.                                                                          |
| 47:54      | And you know, you're always hoping that the plugin marketplace                     |
| 47:57      | can make up for the slack, but I'm honestly just starting                          |
| 48:02      | to lose faith in Apple Mail.                                                       |
| 48:04      | It's like they, they continue to kind of let it linger on                          |
| 48:07      | iOS.                                                                               |
| 48:08      | And as I have been for the last 15 years, I'm actively                             |
| 48:13      | looking for a replacement, but I just don't know what it is.                       |
| 48:16      | And, um, but yeah, I forgot that you were making plugins                           |
| 48:20      | as well.                                                                           |
| 48:21      | That gives me a little bit more understanding of why                               |
| 48:24      | everything breaks with every update.                                               |
| 48:27      | That's right.                                                                      |
| 48:28      | And I think a lot of mail plugin developers are always                             |
| 48:30      | wary or fearful that, you know, the next version of macOS                          |
| 48:33      | is just going to like drop support for plugins.                                    |
| 48:36      | And every year, you know, the plugin support's still there.                        |
| 48:39      | So we don't know what's really going to happen.                                    |
| 48:41      | They're very, you know, obviously they're not talking.                             |
| 48:43      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 48:44      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 48:45      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 48:46      | Obviously not.                                                                     |
| 48:47      | It's just a shame that they can't let you do the same thing                        |
| 48:49      | on iOS because, oh my gosh, mail plugins on iOS and, uh, more                      |
| 48:53      | and more people would be iOS only.                                                 |
| 48:55      | Uh, because I think, you know, being able to manage your                           |
| 48:58      | email is something that people do struggle with.                                   |
| 49:00      | And sure, there are apps like error mail out there, which                          |
| 49:02      | allow you to create custom actions, which they, okay, well,                        |
| 49:05      | when I run this action, mark this as red, forward it to this                       |
| 49:08      | address, um, tag it with this and archive it, um, or                               |
| 49:11      | whatever it is that you need to do.                                                |
| 49:13      | But it's still, you know, that's something that people are                         |
| 49:17      | less familiar with.                                                                |
| 49:18      | And a lot of people do like the stock mail app.                                    |
| 49:20      | And I completely see why it supports SMIME and all of the                          |
| 49:23      | other great features that you want.                                                |
| 49:25      | And in many cases, you know, people don't necessarily have                         |
| 49:28      | a choice.                                                                          |
| 49:29      | They have to use it because that's what work requires                              |
| 49:31      | from them on their devices.                                                        |
| 49:33      | Um, but it's a shame that things don't work differently.                           |
| 49:36      | Yeah, let's hope that, you know, [[Apple]] continues to extend                         |
| 49:39      | kind of the automation features within mail.                                       |
| 49:41      | So I mean, they do have that one automation, like when an                          |
| 49:44      | email comes in from a particular recipient, right?                                 |
| 49:47      | You do need to tap a button though.                                                |
| 49:49      | But maybe in the future, [[Apple]] will release an automation                          |
| 49:52      | framework for apps.                                                                |
| 49:54      | So similar to kind of creating custom shortcut actions,                            |
| 49:57      | maybe you can have a plugin that runs automatically when                           |
| 50:00      | something in the background happens in your app.                                   |
| 50:03      | I could see that if they would just let us run that                                |
| 50:06      | automation automatically when you receive an email,                                |
| 50:09      | I could totally see you writing a mail app for iOS,                                |
| 50:12      | which would just take the information because now with                             |
| 50:14      | iOS 14.3 it can pass all of the, the different email                               |
| 50:18      | information through like the subject, the date and time                            |
| 50:20      | received, the sender, all of that good stuff.                                      |
| 50:23      | So I could totally see somebody like you Adam making,                              |
| 50:25      | making an app that would just go, oh, hey, you know,                               |
| 50:28      | I'm just going to sort this information in.                                        |
| 50:30      | That means I do these things that maybe has its own                                |
| 50:32      | IMAP and SMTP connections or maybe it, you know,                                   |
| 50:36      | just does other things, whatever.                                                  |
| 50:38      | But I could see people getting excited.                                            |
| 50:40      | I think once they unlock that so that we can just run                              |
| 50:43      | that without asking, then people are going to get much                             |
| 50:46      | more excited about this.                                                           |
| 50:48      | I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when [[Apple]]                       |
| 50:51      | made the decisions for iOS 14 about which apps get,                                |
| 50:54      | I'm sorry, which triggers get the automatic automation                             |
| 50:57      | versus which triggers do not.                                                      |
| 50:59      | Because some of it doesn't really make sense to me.                                |
| 51:02      | I, my guess is the automator team was saying just let                              |
| 51:05      | all of them run.                                                                   |
| 51:06      | I mean, they're big boys and girls.                                                |
| 51:08      | They can figure it out.                                                            |
| 51:10      | But I'm sure there were, there are opposing forces inside                          |
| 51:13      | the fruit company.                                                                 |
| 51:15      | Yes, it's unfortunate.                                                             |
| 51:17      | And I do understand why, because, you know,                                        |
| 51:19      | if you get somebody that just plays with these things and                          |
| 51:22      | doesn't really understand what they're doing and then                              |
| 51:24      | they set it up so that now every time they get a message                           |
| 51:27      | from David Sparks, that it automatically pops up and says                          |
| 51:31      | say hello, David, and they're confused as to why.                                  |
| 51:34      | No, that didn't happen to me.                                                      |
| 51:36      | Why are you giving me that look, David?                                            |
| 51:38      | It's fine.                                                                         |
| 51:39      | Don't work.                                                                        |
| 51:40      | So good.                                                                           |
| 51:41      | You know, you can, you can easily set these things up even                         |
| 51:43      | if you're used to the stuff and be confused as to why                              |
| 51:45      | things are happening.                                                              |
| 51:46      | So I do understand why, but yes, I kind of feel that if                            |
| 51:49      | they're giving us the power to play with this stuff,                               |
| 51:52      | then don't, don't say, oh, but in these very few                                   |
| 51:56      | specific cases, you can't just do it entirely automatically.                       |
| 52:00      | You know, you would want it to be doing all of the things for                      |
| 52:04      | you.                                                                               |
| 52:05      | I'm curious to learn the stats from [[Apple]] and how many people                      |
| 52:08      | actually have created an automation, whether it's a                                |
| 52:10      | personal automation or a home automation.                                          |
| 52:13      | Do you have an idea of, of how many people are using                               |
| 52:17      | automations from talking with them?                                                |
| 52:20      | No, no clue, but I know that the automators team                                   |
| 52:24      | desperately wants people to use it because, you know, the                          |
| 52:28      | amount of funding and time and effort that we're going to get                      |
| 52:31      | towards automation is going to be directly related to that                         |
| 52:34      | number.                                                                            |
| 52:35      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 52:36      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 52:37      | I'm sure the shortcuts team are going more people use this                         |
| 52:39      | please.                                                                            |
| 52:40      | So that, you know, and now might be a good time with the                           |
| 52:43      | upcoming year to help people.                                                      |
| 52:45      | Oh, I'm going to help you set up some, some things on your                         |
| 52:48      | phone so that it's easier to use next year and then                                |
| 52:51      | sneakily just set up a couple of shortcuts, personal                               |
| 52:54      | formations for them or show them how to do it so that it                           |
| 52:57      | changes that wallpaper automatically on Monday through                             |
| 53:00      | Friday into a random picture from their favourites the weekend                      |
| 53:03      | or something like that.                                                            |
| 53:04      | You know, just go ahead and set something up so that, you                          |
| 53:07      | know, it's a fun thing for that personal.                                          |
| 53:09      | Maybe it's just something they'll never notice.                                    |
| 53:11      | Take your pick just so that more and more people use it.                           |
| 53:14      | Well, I also think the whole widget explosion and the way                          |
| 53:17      | it kind of slid into shortcuts was only good for shortcuts.                        |
| 53:22      | You know, you can see, you know that they had to jump to the                       |
| 53:25      | top of the line to get the thing to launch a shortcut                              |
| 53:28      | without going into the app like it used to.                                        |
| 53:31      | That was a direct relation to the fact that a lot of people                        |
| 53:34      | who did not traditionally use shortcuts were suddenly using                        |
| 53:37      | it.                                                                                |
| 53:38      | And I would guess that the number is much higher because                           |
| 53:41      | of widgets and I hope that is reflected with iOS 15 that they                      |
| 53:46      | even, you know, put the gas down harder on it.                                     |
| 53:50      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by TextExpander                       |
| 53:52      | from our good friends at Smile.                                                    |
| 53:54      | Get ahead of your productivity for the new year with the power                     |
| 53:57      | of TextExpander.                                                                   |
| 53:58      | TextExpander removes the repetition out of work, so you                            |
| 54:01      | can focus on what matters most.                                                    |
| 54:03      | Say goodbye to repetitive text entry, spelling and                                 |
| 54:06      | message errors, and remembering the right thing to say.                            |
| 54:10      | When you use TextExpander, you can say the right thing in                          |
| 54:13      | just a few keystrokes.                                                             |
| 54:16      | It's better than copy and paste, better than scripts and                           |
| 54:17      | templates.                                                                         |
| 54:18      | And because TextExpander snippets allow you to maximise                            |
| 54:20      | your time by getting rid of the repetitive things you type                         |
| 54:23      | while still customising and personalising your messages,                           |
| 54:26      | you'll be ahead of the game.                                                       |
| 54:29      | I love TextExpander.                                                               |
| 54:30      | I use it for all sorts of things.                                                  |
| 54:31      | And in fact, it's great.                                                           |
| 54:33      | I used it just the other day to create a couple of new                             |
| 54:35      | meeting templates for work, for regular catch-ups that I've                        |
| 54:38      | got with different people.                                                         |
| 54:39      | It means that I can just type a few keystrokes and bam,                            |
| 54:42      | everything's there with today's date filled in and                                 |
| 54:45      | everything else that I need ready to go.                                           |
| 54:48      | It's going to save me hours in the new year, and more                              |
| 54:50      | importantly, provide me with that consistency that I need.                         |

| 55:11      | I'll thanks to TextExpander and Smell for their support of                         |
| 55:13      | this show and Relay FM.                                                            |
| 55:16      | So Adam, one of the things we talked about at the top is                           |
| 55:19      | you've created some YouTube videos on MFC Deck.                                    |
| 55:21      | And I couldn't help but notice in the bottom right-hand corner                     |
| 55:25      | is this funky looking grill thing, which I'm assuming                              |
| 55:29      | must be an Apple Pro XDR display.                                                  |
| 55:31      | Is it?                                                                             |
| 55:32      | And how are you using it?                                                          |
| 55:33      | What is it connected to?                                                           |
| 55:34      | So yes, that is an Apple Pro XDR display.                                          |
| 55:37      | I actually had a 30 inch cinema display.                                           |
| 55:41      | I bought that in like 2005 and I used that for 10 years and                        |
| 55:44      | it's still being in use 15 years later with my father-in-law.                      |
| 55:48      | And there's something to be said about having a good display                       |
| 55:52      | that you can look at and that you're happy with, looking at                        |
| 55:55      | day in, day out, because I basically on my computer for                            |
| 55:58      | eight to 10 hours a day.                                                           |
| 56:00      | And it was a very expensive purchase.                                              |
| 56:03      | You know, I looked at a wide variety of monitors.                                  |
| 56:06      | You know, there's like Dell monitors as the LG monitors.                           |
| 56:09      | I thought about, oh, can I get by with just using my                               |
| 56:13      | Apple Thunderbolt display?                                                         |
| 56:15      | Because I was, I was going to buy an M1 Mac mini.                                  |
| 56:18      | And so I placed the order for that, but that was going to take                     |
| 56:22      | like an extra two to three weeks to ship.                                          |
| 56:25      | And I wanted to, you know, to use a display like right now.                        |
| 56:30      | So I ended up buying XDR and I was using it with a                                 |
| 56:34      | 2015 MacBook Pro.                                                                  |
| 56:36      | And it only, the resolutions, you don't get as many resolution                     |
| 56:40      | options as on like the newer Macs.                                                 |
| 56:43      | And it's actually interesting.                                                     |
| 56:44      | My Mac mini came in yesterday.                                                     |
| 56:46      | And so I was like, all excited.                                                    |
| 56:47      | I'm going to be able to like bump up the resolution.                               |
| 56:49      | And I plugged it in and I saw like less resolution options                         |
| 56:53      | than on my Mac, my MacBook Pro.                                                    |
| 56:56      | But I think there's some third party apps that I can use to                        |
| 56:59      | kind of reveal some of these extra resolution options.                             |
| 57:03      | I'm going to go try installing those later today.                                  |
| 57:06      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 57:07      | So I have one that I use and I use this a lot for screen                           |
| 57:09      | casting.                                                                           |
| 57:10      | It's just called displays, which is possibly the worst                             |
| 57:13      | searchable, worst name possible searchability wise.                                |
| 57:17      | But so I've got a 34 inch ultra wide Logitech.                                     |
| 57:22      | And it's default resolution is 3440 pixels wide by                                 |
| 57:26      | 1440 pixels high.                                                                  |
| 57:28      | But when I click on the displays app, then I can choose                            |
| 57:33      | all sorts of different screen resolutions, including, you                          |
| 57:37      | know, I can get things that are going down to four, four by                        |
| 57:40      | three.                                                                             |
| 57:41      | So 1024 pixels by 768 pixels and things like that.                                 |
| 57:45      | And I have all that.                                                               |
| 57:46      | And I also have a portable display that I frequently plug                          |
| 57:48      | in, because let's be honest, having a small rectangular                            |
| 57:52      | blob in the middle of the otherwise very large and useful                          |
| 57:55      | display is not the most helpful.                                                   |
| 57:57      | I like to have multiple screens for screen casting just so                         |
| 57:59      | I've got what I'm, what I'm showing people versus, you                             |
| 58:01      | know, what, what I need to be able to see.                                         |
| 58:03      | And so I have a portable 15 inch monitor, which just plugs                         |
| 58:07      | in via USB-C.                                                                      |
| 58:08      | And that has got such an insanely long list of different                           |
| 58:13      | resolutions.                                                                       |
| 58:14      | It's insane, but it works super well.                                              |
| 58:17      | So that, that's a great app.                                                       |
| 58:18      | It's a menu bar application.                                                       |
| 58:19      | I'll put a link to that in show notes as well.                                     |
| 58:21      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 58:22      | And I know Adam, you're a very enthusiastic, enthusiastic                          |
| 58:24      | photographer, so I would imagine the colour, you know,                              |
| 58:28      | spectrum on that monitor is probably something you really                          |
| 58:30      | like.                                                                              |
| 58:31      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 58:32      | The monitor is actually fantastic.                                                 |
| 58:34      | I got the glossy display and usually I'm more of a matte                           |
| 58:37      | fan, but with a little kid around the house, I, I didn't                           |
| 58:42      | realise the opportunity to have to clean it every, all,                            |
| 58:45      | every once in a while.                                                             |
| 58:46      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 58:47      | But the glossy one actually does a pretty good job of                              |
| 58:49      | reducing reflections and glare, but it's a, it's a                                 |
| 58:52      | wonderful display.                                                                 |
| 58:54      | I mean, I mean, it better be for the amount of money that                          |
| 58:57      | I paid for it, you know.                                                           |
| 58:58      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 58:59      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 59:00      | And I'm sure you'll be using it for years to come and I                            |
| 59:03      | don't know.                                                                        |
| 59:04      | It's weird, you know, as [[Apple]], I went through this with                           |
| 59:07      | the headphones.                                                                    |
| 59:08      | I bought the headphones that are $500.                                             |
| 59:10      | I joked on my colleges, but it's true.                                             |
| 59:13      | The first car I bought was less money than these                                   |
| 59:16      | headphones, you know, but at the end of the day, they                              |
| 59:20      | make me happy and I've blown money on dumber things in                             |
| 59:24      | my life.                                                                           |
| 59:25      | So just, just go with it.                                                          |
| 59:27      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 59:28      | I'm trying not to regret the decision.                                             |
| 59:29      | Every time I look at it, I said, oh, this is very nice.                            |
| 59:31      | And I can rotate the display to portrait, although it looks,                       |
| 59:34      | looks huge when it's in portrait mode.                                             |
| 59:36      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 59:37      | I can imagine like a word processing document on that                              |
| 59:39      | monster screen turned up.                                                          |
| 59:41      | That'd be kind of funny.                                                           |
| 59:43      | It is nice when you're reading like online documentation.                          |
| 59:46      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 59:47      | I mean, one of your, one of your online books, it's great.                         |
| 59:51      | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 59:52      | I think Rosa has two of them on order.                                             |
| 59:54      | Don't you have two of those XDR screens coming in, Rose?                           |
| 59:57      | David, I'm not made of money.                                                      |
| 59:59      | I am wearing a pair of AirPods Max right now plugged in via                        |
| 01:00:03   | the extremely expensive Lightning 3.5 millimeter cable.                            |
| 01:00:08   | But, you know, they are super comfy and I got them                                 |
| 01:00:11   | because my previous headphones, if I was doing a long day of                       |
| 01:00:13   | podcasting or screencasting, were genuinely giving me a                            |
| 01:00:15   | headache where they were resting on my head.                                       |
| 01:00:17   | And so I thought I'd give these a try.                                             |
| 01:00:19   | And I'm very sad to say that I'm probably going to be keeping                      |
| 01:00:22   | them because they are extremely comfortable and I like them.                       |
| 01:00:25   | And I wish I didn't.                                                               |
| 01:00:26   | I had this picture of like a meeting somewhere at [[Apple]] where                      |
| 01:00:29   | someone's like, yeah, and then we're going to make a cable                         |
| 01:00:31   | so you can plug it into your Mac, but we're going to charge                        |
| 01:00:34   | you $35 for it, you know?                                                          |
| 01:00:36   | So, so the beauty of this is they didn't even need to make                         |
| 01:00:39   | the cable.                                                                         |
| 01:00:40   | They already had it for the beats.                                                 |
| 01:00:42   | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 01:00:43   | Oh, man.                                                                           |
| 01:00:45   | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 01:00:46   | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 01:00:47   | No, it's amazing how wonderful this technology is.                                 |
| 01:00:49   | How is that M1 Mac Mini aside from the screen resolution                           |
| 01:00:52   | options, Adam?                                                                     |
| 01:00:53   | Well, the initial setup weren't well, but then I tried to                          |
| 01:00:56   | start migration assistant last night and I plugged in my Mac,                      |
| 01:00:59   | my MacBook Pro.                                                                    |
| 01:01:00   | And then I said, okay, it says it's starting.                                      |
| 01:01:03   | I'm going to go to sleep.                                                          |
| 01:01:04   | And when I wake up, you know, the Mac Mini will be, will be                        |
| 01:01:06   | basically a clone of my MacBook Pro.                                               |
| 01:01:08   | And then I woke up in the morning, I went to my computer and                       |
| 01:01:11   | it was still stuck on the same screen starting, starting copy.                     |
| 01:01:15   | So right now the Mac Mini has, hasn't been configured.                             |
| 01:01:19   | I'm recording this podcast from my MacBook Pro right now.                          |
| 01:01:22   | And I, I'm trying to wrestle with, should I do the                                 |
| 01:01:25   | migration system again, or should I just manually copy,                            |
| 01:01:28   | you know, files and data and reinstall applications.                               |
| 01:01:31   | So it's like a kind of like a fresh install.                                       |
| 01:01:33   | What, what would you recommend?                                                    |
| 01:01:34   | I'd go with a fresh install.                                                       |
| 01:01:36   | I mean, you've got that all, all that new M1 goodness and so on.                   |
| 01:01:39   | That'd be a nice time to have it clear out as you're switching,                    |
| 01:01:41   | you know, chips.                                                                   |
| 01:01:43   | I also feel like, like the apps, you want to make sure the apps                    |
| 01:01:46   | get the Apple Silicon version installed.                                           |
| 01:01:49   | Yeah.                                                                              |
| 01:01:50   | Like Zoom has a different version that you need to download                        |
| 01:01:52   | if you, if you're using the Apple Silicon version.                                 |
| 01:01:55   | So there's, there's going to be a couple of those, I'm sure.                       |
| 01:01:59   | That's what I would be doing.                                                      |
| 01:02:00   | I'm sticking with my Intel Mac Mini for now.                                       |
| 01:02:02   | And David, do not try and twist my arm on this.                                    |
| 01:02:04   | I'm sticking with it.                                                              |
| 01:02:05   | I'm happy.                                                                         |
| 01:02:06   | I'm happy to XDR monitors.                                                         |
| 01:02:09   | My wife had a 10 year old MacBook Pro, the original 13 inch                        |
| 01:02:15   | MacBook Pro, and it was really failing.                                            |
| 01:02:18   | So I bought her the M1 MacBook Air.                                                |
| 01:02:22   | And it was the very first time I've ever had a migration                           |
| 01:02:25   | assistant migration fail.                                                          |
| 01:02:28   | I mean, it did, it said it was done and it didn't move everything                  |
| 01:02:31   | over.                                                                              |
| 01:02:32   | She's got a bunch of files that are not there.                                     |
| 01:02:34   | It clearly, like even the wallpaper wasn't right.                                  |
| 01:02:37   | So something went wrong.                                                           |
| 01:02:39   | I think maybe migration assistant is choking a bit going                           |
| 01:02:43   | between Intel and Apple Silicon.                                                   |
| 01:02:45   | And I'm sure they'll get a future update and that'll go away.                      |
| 01:02:48   | But I can tell you, I had a similar problem.                                       |
| 01:02:51   | And now I'm just going to manually move her files over                             |
| 01:02:54   | and we're keeping her old computer.                                                |
| 01:02:56   | I mean, her old computer has zero value.                                           |
| 01:02:58   | I couldn't sell it.                                                                |
| 01:02:59   | I couldn't, the only thing I can do is turn it to [[Apple]]                            |
| 01:03:01   | and let them recycle it.                                                           |
| 01:03:02   | We're going to hold on to it for like six months to make sure                      |
| 01:03:04   | we got everything off of it we needed.                                             |
| 01:03:06   | But migration assistant, I think, may have some issues                             |
| 01:03:10   | with this transition.                                                              |
| 01:03:12   | Yeah, I think that makes my decision clear.                                        |
| 01:03:14   | I'm going to manually move everything.                                             |
| 01:03:17   | I think that's a good shout.                                                       |
| 01:03:19   | I mean, it's not necessarily something that you want to do.                        |
| 01:03:22   | But at the same time, it's worth doing these things right                          |
| 01:03:25   | every, you know, when you do them.                                                 |
| 01:03:27   | And how often do you upgrade a Mac?                                                |
| 01:03:30   | You know, that's something that hopefully you will be doing again                  |
| 01:03:33   | for a good couple of years.                                                        |
| 01:03:34   | So it's worth doing it properly now so that you can enjoy it                       |
| 01:03:38   | for the next however long it takes.                                                |
| 01:03:41   | Adam, I know that you spend a lot of time, you know,                               |
| 01:03:44   | working on these apps to improve shortcuts.                                        |
| 01:03:47   | And I was thinking it'd be a fun game to play.                                     |
| 01:03:50   | What if Tim Cook calls you up and says, hey, Adam,                                 |
| 01:03:53   | I love your apps.                                                                  |
| 01:03:55   | I want you to come in and be the king of shortcuts at [[Apple]].                       |
| 01:03:59   | What would you change about shortcuts                                              |
| 01:04:01   | if you had those godlike powers?                                                   |
| 01:04:04   | Oh, great power comes great responsibility.                                        |
| 01:04:07   | Let me think about that.                                                           |
| 01:04:08   | So there are no negative consequences to your actions.                             |
| 01:04:11   | There we go. Let's make that a tad easier for you.                                 |
| 01:04:14   | Definitely removing that confirmation toggle from all those.                       |
| 01:04:18   | Amen. Personal automation triggers.                                                |
| 01:04:20   | Oh, yeah.                                                                          |
| 01:04:22   | The ability for third party applications to run shortcuts                          |
| 01:04:25   | without opening up the shortcuts app would be great.                               |
| 01:04:29   | The ability to run shortcuts in the background                                     |
| 01:04:32   | without kind of making those menus disappear.                                      |
| 01:04:34   | So right now if you like have a personal automation                                |
| 01:04:37   | and that runs say at 11 o'clock,                                                   |
| 01:04:40   | but at the exact same moment,                                                      |
| 01:04:42   | you like run a shortcut manually by tapping on it                                  |
| 01:04:45   | and it brings the menu that personal automation would run                          |
| 01:04:47   | and then make your menu disappear.                                                 |
| 01:04:49   | So this got modal, you know, making those menus disappear.                         |
| 01:04:52   | I hate how the menus appear from the top                                           |
| 01:04:55   | and make it back so that they appear from the bottom.                              |
| 01:04:58   | Again, I would obviously add the ability                                           |
| 01:05:02   | to do nested folders and tags to into shortcuts.                                   |
| 01:05:06   | So basically take all the features of my apps                                      |
| 01:05:09   | and put them into the main shortcuts application.                                  |
| 01:05:13   | I mean, I think that's a pretty good chat.                                         |
| 01:05:15   | I'd also turn off be a lot of people to turn off notifications                     |
| 01:05:18   | for individual automations.                                                        |
| 01:05:20   | I could manually say, for example,                                                 |
| 01:05:22   | the one where I disconnect my phone from power,                                    |
| 01:05:24   | that just shouldn't show me a notification.                                        |
| 01:05:26   | Same as the one when I connect my phone to power.                                  |
| 01:05:28   | I don't want to see those notifications.                                           |
| 01:05:30   | I get it. It's fine.                                                               |
| 01:05:32   | And sure, maybe I have to configure that in the automation itself                  |
| 01:05:34   | and say, don't show me a notification on this,                                     |
| 01:05:37   | but I would love to do that.                                                       |
| 01:05:39   | What about you, David?                                                             |
| 01:05:41   | I think they'd also have to assign Adam physical security                          |
| 01:05:44   | because the software security guys                                                 |
| 01:05:46   | would come at him with pitchforks.                                                 |
| 01:05:48   | No. That's okay.                                                                   |
| 01:05:51   | I'll be on Adam's team. We're good.                                                |
| 01:05:53   | We'll put on some roller skates and some knee guards                               |
| 01:05:56   | and we'll be fine.                                                                 |
| 01:05:58   | I'm just glad you would take one for the team, Adam.                               |
| 01:06:00   | That's all I'm saying.                                                             |
| 01:06:02   | Whatever it takes.                                                                 |
| 01:06:03   | Adam, I love talking to you                                                        |
| 01:06:05   | because you're just so thoughtful on automation                                    |
| 01:06:07   | and the stuff, the tools you make.                                                 |
| 01:06:09   | I mean, I can't even imagine something like MFC Deck                               |
| 01:06:13   | and all of the ways that improve shortcuts.                                        |
| 01:06:15   | Anybody listening, honestly,                                                       |
| 01:06:17   | the Automators podcast, go download MFC Deck                                       |
| 01:06:19   | and fiddle with it a little bit.                                                   |
| 01:06:21   | Watch some of Adam's videos.                                                       |
| 01:06:23   | I bet you'll find a good use for it.                                               |
| 01:06:25   | And congratulations on getting this really impressive app out the door.            |
| 01:06:29   | Thank you.                                                                         |
| 01:06:30   | Can't wait to see what we come up next                                             |
| 01:06:33   | when I come on the show next time.                                                 |
| 01:06:35   | Yeah, I know.                                                                      |
| 01:06:36   | I mean, every time you outdo yourself.                                             |
| 01:06:38   | So where do we go next?                                                            |
| 01:06:40   | If you want to learn more about Adam,                                              |
| 01:06:43   | you go to tau.com, T-O-W.com.                                                      |
| 01:06:46   | And we've also put links in for the apps you've made.                              |
| 01:06:50   | So go check those out as well.                                                     |
| 01:06:52   | And I've put in a bunch of the YouTube videos.                                     |
| 01:06:55   | So make sure you go check those out.                                               |
| 01:06:57   | And Adam, once again, awesome work getting this thing out the door.                |
| 01:07:01   | Thanks, man.                                                                       |
| 01:07:02   | Great. Thanks again for having me.                                                 |
| 01:07:04   | And I'd really love to give our listeners some homework if I may.                  |
| 01:07:07   | If you've created a deck or even just a cool widget in MFC Deck,                   |
| 01:07:10   | post it in our forums with a link to the shortcut                                  |
| 01:07:13   | or a little how to or just post a screenshot and, you know,                        |
| 01:07:16   | a little explanation with your deck or something                                   |
| 01:07:19   | because I am looking to steal ideas.                                               |
| 01:07:22   | And I'm hoping that by the time the show releases,                                 |
| 01:07:24   | because we are recording a little bit ahead of schedule due to the holiday season, |
| 01:07:27   | that I will be able to get some of my stuff up there as well for you to go         |
| 01:07:30   | and look at and, you know, get started with.                                       |
| 01:07:33   | Because this is a great app.                                                       |
| 01:07:35   | And I really feel the more people that use it,                                     |
| 01:07:37   | the more ideas people will have.                                                   |
| 01:07:39   | Yeah. And by the way, happy new year, everybody.                                   |
| 01:07:42   | Let's hope we don't have 2020 the sequel.                                          |
| 01:07:44   | There we go.                                                                       |

| 01:08:24   | Not really.                                                                        |

| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automated. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and as always, I'm joined                  |
| 00:06      | by my co-host, David Sparks. Hey, David, how are you today?                                               |
| 00:09      | I'm great, Rosemary. Today, we're talking about one of my favourite things about automation,              |
| 00:14      | and that's capture. I feel like that is something that all automators need to think about.               |
| 00:19      | Yes, absolutely. Because, I mean, let's be honest, most people are into the automation                   |
| 00:23      | for the productivity side of things, whether it's just not having to do work or then having              |
| 00:28      | less work to do or having your work done perfectly every time. There's a whole bunch                     |
| 00:33      | of reasons why we do it, but it pretty much boils down to A, having fun, and B, being productive.        |
| 00:39      | I think good capture is a great part of being productive.                                                |
| 00:43      | Yes, I mean, not only that, I feel like capture is, for a lot of people, the most frequent               |
| 00:47      | point of failure. I mean, you talk to somebody on the phone, or you get an email, or you                 |
| 00:54      | think of something when you wake up in the morning, and it's something you really need                   |
| 00:58      | to work on. Like, I just did that on Friday. I had a call with a client, and I said, oh,                 |
| 01:04      | yeah, I'll make a contract for you that does X, Y, and Z. And then as soon as I hung up,                 |
| 01:10      | there was something with the family, and I had to run out the door, and then I woke up                   |
| 01:13      | Monday morning thinking, you know what, I never captured that thing on Friday. And it                    |
| 01:18      | was just, I was lucky because if I hadn't remembered, I totally would have dropped the                   |
| 01:21      | ball on it. And I think for a lot of us, that's something we do frequently. And if you can               |
| 01:28      | bring automation tools to bear, maybe that can help you avoid dropping the ball. And                     |
| 01:32      | that's what we're all about today.                                                                       |
| 01:34      | Yeah, yeah. And so, I mean, while we're talking about automated capture, I think we really               |
| 01:38      | need to start with what do we actually capture, and what do we need to capture? Because there            |
| 01:44      | are so many different things. One of the things that I captured yesterday was the interior               |
| 01:48      | dimensions of a cupboard, because I needed to buy a basket that fits in the cupboard                     |
| 01:53      | so that when I opened the cupboard, not everything would just fly out. I've got some snacks and          |
| 01:57      | stuff in there and in like those inflated packages. So every time I opened the cupboard,                 |
| 02:02      | it was kind of like confetti cannon, and these things were just flying across my kitchen.                |
| 02:06      | So it's like, okay, I need a basket. So A, I need to buy a basket, but I need the dimensions             |
| 02:11      | for this. And so I captured that. And there's all sorts of things that we need to capture.               |
| 02:17      | So I was wondering, before we dive too deep into this, let's give our Automators listeners               |
| 02:22      | a bit of a background. What kind of things do you capture?                                               |
| 02:24      | Like you, everything. I mean, just like I was mentioning earlier, thoughts are an important              |
| 02:29      | capture because my brain is always like cooking in the background on ideas. And if I don't               |
| 02:35      | write them down, I lose them. So that's important. We've talked often on the show about tasks.           |
| 02:42      | I mean, right? You've got to capture those, right? As soon as they occur to you. What                    |
| 02:48      | are some of your favourite things? Well, I mean, as well as thoughts and tasks,                           |
| 02:52      | I also just, you know, anything that seems like it might be important. And I like to                     |
| 02:59      | do this simply because I can then go through it and process. I mean, both you and I are                  |
| 03:05      | followers of GTD. So there's capture and then there's actually, you know, the processing,                |
| 03:09      | which you do later. And I do try to do those separately. It's very tempting to just do                   |
| 03:13      | it all together and be like, okay, so this is a task. So I'm going to capture this and                   |
| 03:16      | put it in an omnifocus, which is, you know, something I'm now trying to avoid doing. But                 |
| 03:22      | I just try to capture anything that seems like it might be important. So I was on the                    |
| 03:25      | phone with my mom earlier today. She was giving me some instructions for how she prefers to              |
| 03:29      | cook roast beef, which is not the same as the instructions on the packageing. And I captured              |
| 03:35      | that. I wrote it down. And so, and that could be a task. And in fact, it is because I've                 |
| 03:41      | got some roast beef or some beef that I need to roast. But it's also reference material                  |
| 03:45      | and things like that. And then, you know, I also just, you know, captured things like,                   |
| 03:49      | you know, images of something that makes me that reminds me, you know, of things to do.                  |
| 03:56      | So yeah, so I've been capturing a lot recently.                                                          |
| 03:59      | Well, something you just said that I think really resonates is the reason for capture.                   |
| 04:06      | I mean, there's two primary reasons in my head at least. The first one is capture for                    |
| 04:11      | the purpose of action, you know, you've got a task you need to act on, you've got a promise              |
| 04:16      | you need to fulfill, you know, there's things you need to do, you need to act on them. And               |
| 04:20      | if you don't capture them into the trusted system to use David Allen's parlance, you're                  |
| 04:26      | going to lose them. But I think an equally important purpose for capture is reference,                   |
| 04:33      | you know, like mom's recipe for roast beef. Or like just recently, we've got this odd                    |
| 04:39      | colour yellow in our, in one of our rooms. Daisy picked it out while I was at work one                    |
| 04:44      | day. That's all I'm gonna say. That's all I'm gonna say. But I love her very much and                    |
| 04:49      | yellow is fine. But anytime I want to get paint to like touch up the room, I have captured               |
| 04:56      | the formula for that colour yellow, you know, and so when I go to the hardware store, I                   |
| 05:02      | can say this is the formula, please give me some more of this paint. But that's a reference.             |
| 05:07      | Reference capture for me is almost bigger than action capture. Like because I'm a lawyer,                |
| 05:14      | I capture a lot of discussions and ideas and thoughts I have with clients on strategising                |
| 05:21      | and doing projects for clients. And that's really referenced more than its action. But                   |
| 05:27      | I need to capture it because I need to be able to reference it later. The journal entry                  |
| 05:33      | notes are another good one. You know, I want to put stuff in my journal. I want to have                  |
| 05:37      | a reference to it. Like you, you probably referenced or referenced captured the dimensions               |
| 05:44      | of your cupboard when you open it up, right? Yeah, yeah, I did. So I had a tape measure                  |
| 05:49      | and I just grabbed all that stuff and and or, you know, looked at it and I considered                    |
| 05:55      | taking a photo of the cupboard and then diagramming it. And I realised that by the time I did that,      |
| 05:59      | I could just grab my [[Apple Pencil]] and draw it on my iPad. And then, you know, I had it                   |
| 06:03      | right there. And I will confess that one didn't go into my typical capture system, but I'm               |
| 06:09      | always willing to make allowances so that I actually have the data captured in the format                |
| 06:13      | that makes the most sense for the data rather than saying that I have to stick to a specific             |
| 06:17      | map. Yeah, and there's a lot of places you can                                                           |
| 06:19      | store that reference or the action. I mean, we've talked about multiple task applications                |
| 06:25      | and we've talked about multiple personal knowledge applications. I think the darling                     |
| 06:29      | for both Rose and I at the moment is obsidian, but you know, it could be Evernote or it could            |
| 06:34      | be just [[Drafts]], notes or whatever. There's a lot of places you could put this stuff                      |
| 06:39      | for reference, but the goal of today's show is really to talk about how do we automate                   |
| 06:44      | and quick in and make that capture possible. But I did think it's worth talking about that,              |
| 06:49      | you know, understanding that whether something's going to be an action item or reference item            |
| 06:54      | may impact the way that you proceed with doing the capture itself.                                       |
| 06:59      | Yes. Yeah. My question for you is, what apps are you using for capture usually? Do you                   |
| 07:05      | capture in the same place that you know the item is going to end up in or do you capture                 |
| 07:09      | in specific applications? Again, there's two categories. Yeah. When I'm being deliberate                 |
| 07:16      | about capture, I like to have very few tools. I mean, you don't want to have a lot of different          |
| 07:22      | inboxes that you have to check every day. So the weapon of choice for a very long time                   |
| 07:28      | for me has been [[Drafts]]. I mean, I can capture as text and we're going to get into in the                 |
| 07:34      | meat of today's show what we can do with [[Drafts]] since we do those captures, but [[Drafts]] is                |
| 07:40      | like the ideal capture tool. It's an app that's on your phone, which is in your pocket at                |
| 07:44      | all times. And the beautiful, one of the best features of this app is that when you hit                  |
| 07:50      | the icon or you launch the app, you don't have to create a new file. You don't have                      |
| 07:56      | to, you know, throw salt over your shoulder. You just open the app and there is a blinking               |
| 08:02      | cursor so you can immediately write something down. And as silly as that sounds, that was                |
| 08:08      | a revolutionary feature when it came out and it remains super powerful and, you know, has                |
| 08:14      | great support for dictation and typing. So you can get text into it very quickly. A related              |
| 08:22      | feature of [[Drafts]] is the best watch OS app, I think that exists. I'll, I mean, that I'll                 |
| 08:30      | at least I'll say it's my favourite third party app on the watch. I mean, there's a lot of                |
| 08:34      | people making cool watch apps, but [[Drafts]] puts a little [[Drafts]] icon in your widget screen.               |
| 08:41      | It's on almost every watch face I own because when an idea occurs to me, I can lift my wrist,            |
| 08:47      | tap that one icon and just start talking to my watch and it captures to [[Drafts]]. I mean,                  |
| 08:53      | it's so good for that. So, so the first category is deliberate capture goes into [[Drafts]]. The             |
| 08:58      | second category is more like focused capture. And I there's a bunch of apps that I use that              |
| 09:05      | also have quick capture built into them, like OmniFocus has a great capture tool. And they               |
| 09:12      | also have macros you can run to capture email and, you know, different things you can do.                |
| 09:17      | So when I'm working in OmniFocus, I'll use the OmniFocus quick capture. I won't go back                  |
| 09:22      | to [[Drafts]] and then send it to OmniFocus later, although I can just like [[Obsidian]] when I talked           |
| 09:28      | about earlier, like client notes on calls and things. Usually when I'm on a call with                    |
| 09:33      | a client, I've got the [[Obsidian]] note open for the transaction we're discussing so I can                  |
| 09:37      | reference prior information. So of course, I'll just capture the notes right there in                    |
| 09:42      | [[Obsidian]] during that call. I don't need to put in [[Drafts]] come back. I don't I don't need                 |
| 09:47      | to be pedantic about it. I guess is what I'm saying. If it makes sense to go straight to                 |
| 09:52      | the reference app or the action app and put it in, I'll do that. But if I'm just wandering               |
| 09:57      | around and a random idea occurs to me or I just hang up the phone with my mom about how                  |
| 10:02      | to cook roast beef, likely I'll go to [[Drafts]].                                                            |
| 10:05      | Yeah, yeah, I very much do the same. I've assigned a shortcut to the double back tap                     |
| 10:11      | on my iPhone. This is something you can do in accessibility settings that came up with                   |
| 10:15      | iOS 14. You can you can set it to do specific things like take a screenshot or something                 |
| 10:20      | like that. But I have set it to open [[Drafts]]. And for a long time, I thought that this feature            |
| 10:25      | was kind of flaky. And that was because I was trying to double tap the bottom of my                      |
| 10:28      | iPhone. It turns out if you double tap the [[Apple]] logo, then it works every single time,                  |
| 10:33      | guaranteed. And I've set that up so they create a new draft automatically. That's the shortcut           |
| 10:37      | is running create draft and it and then it opens that a new draft for me. Because that                   |
| 10:43      | gets me into [[Drafts]] super, super quickly. The other thing, of course, that I have is                     |
| 10:49      | I've got a widget on my home screen, which has got [[Drafts]] in it. So I can see my inbox.                  |
| 10:52      | I've got a plus button. I've got a clipboard button. And I also have a search and then                   |
| 10:58      | I have four different workspaces that I frequently use, which is really handy so that I can go           |
| 11:07      | into workspaces specifically, rather than just, you know, a generic area of [[Drafts]].                      |
| 11:14      | Because workspaces have the action groups and so on associated with them. So when I                      |
| 11:18      | open my processing workspace, then it very specifically loads, you know, things so that                  |
| 11:22      | I can, you know, get my captured items then to their destination really quickly. I've                    |
| 11:29      | also got it assigned to keyboard shortcut on macOS. So if I'm sitting here and somebody                  |
| 11:35      | says something, if it is not related to exactly what it is that I'm looking at, I open [[Drafts]]           |
| 11:39      | and I type it and then I'm done. And that's it. Because that makes it much easier. I try                 |
| 11:45      | like it's like you, you know, you said with the with the client notes, if you're if you're               |
| 11:49      | an obsidian, then you'll capture into that. If I'm in the right place to capture, you                    |
| 11:54      | know, into that, then I will absolutely proceed to. But otherwise, I will change things up               |
| 12:00      | and just switch it straight over to [[Drafts]]. So and again, you know, like you, I also occasionally        |
| 12:08      | capture into OmniFocus, but I've really been trying to not be in OmniFocus as silly as                   |
| 12:14      | that sounds for actual task completion. Because if I find if I sit in my task manager, then              |
| 12:19      | I end up, you know, shuffling the deck rather than actually dealing the cards. So yeah,                  |
| 12:26      | I'm trying to work on capturing and I, you know, I don't want thousands of inboxes. So                   |
| 12:31      | I I'm pretty much doing that in [[Drafts]], though there are some exceptions, which we will get              |
| 12:37      | to.                                                                                                      |
| 12:38      | I do think that one of the important things to make a capture system, automated or not                   |
| 12:45      | automated work is just low resistance. And yes, being able to work on project A and have                 |
| 12:53      | thought occur to you on project B and then hit a keyboard combo, type a few words about                  |
| 12:57      | it and know that it just got saved to [[Drafts]] or pull your phone out of your pocket and                   |
| 13:02      | dictate a quick note or to your wrist is exactly what you're looking for. Because you don't              |
| 13:08      | want to lose your train of thought on project A. You're like, I've got this random thing                 |
| 13:12      | rattling around my head about project B, capture that real quick. And then I'll come back to             |
| 13:16      | it later. And I think that, you know, you're on the right track there. Like I said earlier,              |
| 13:23      | the one thing is if you are in the right place, don't go back to [[Drafts]] because there's a                |
| 13:27      | whole procedure and we're going to talk about that later about, you know, how do you get                 |
| 13:30      | the stuff out of [[Drafts]] into the various buckets they belong later. But but otherwise, yeah,             |
| 13:36      | just just get something like that. You know, if you don't want to spend money, you could                 |
| 13:41      | do it in Apple notes, you could just open an Apple note and you could have one ready.                    |
| 13:45      | Well, I mean, [[Drafts]] is free. That's something that people will keep forgetting [[Drafts]] is                |
| 13:49      | actually free. The in-app purchase is only necessary if you're doing things like creating                |
| 13:53      | your own actions and workspaces and stuff like that. If you just want to use [[Drafts]]                     |
| 13:57      | for capture and use the downloaded actions that are available, then you can do that.                     |
| 14:02      | And I would argue that you should do that because [[Drafts]] is a great application for                      |
| 14:06      | this. But I mean, there are plenty of other applications that you could use. I mean, I                   |
| 14:11      | actually do use [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] for some things because when I say hello, [[Apple]] lady, and                      |
| 14:16      | she's listening because I've got a speaker in almost every room now. I don't have one                    |
| 14:20      | in the hallway, but there are three rooms adjacent to the hallway with these. I don't                    |
| 14:24      | have one in the bathroom. So I have to use my [[Apple Watch]] there if I need to capture                     |
| 14:29      | something there. But you know, if I say hey, lady, then she captures stuff. And that works               |
| 14:37      | really well because then anything with a time on, I just assume that it's got to go into                 |
| 14:43      | you. So geo automatically grabs that for me. If it's got a location on, then it gets left                |
| 14:48      | alone. And if it doesn't have either of those, then it ends up in [[Drafts]] for me, which is                |
| 14:53      | something that works really well.                                                                        |
| 14:54      | Yeah, I just don't trust the HomePod enough yet to do quick capturing it with my voice                  |
| 15:01      | because too often it gets it wrong. And then it ends up taking you more time. It's so much               |
| 15:06      | faster, which is kind of curious because my watch is also doing Siri voice to text                       |
| 15:12      | dictation, but it just seems like it does such a better job capturing straight to [[Drafts]].                |
| 15:17      | And to follow up on your earlier point, I had forgotten that you can get [[Drafts]] for free                    |
| 15:20      | and the stuff we're talking about for like quick capture, I think the free model is almost               |
| 15:25      | everything you need. Although of course we're going to improve that with custom actions                  |
| 15:30      | and things later, which we'll talk about later in the show.                                              |
| 15:34      | Yes, but yeah, the fundamentally what we're talking about here can be done the free version.             |
| 15:38      | So if you've if you've been going, I'm not sure about [[Drafts]], then you know, you can                     |
| 15:41      | grab the free version for this episode and give it a shot because it does work really,                   |
| 15:46      | really well.                                                                                             |
| 15:49      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Sync Up, a OneDrive podcast. I love finding               |
| 15:53      | new podcasts to listen to. It's great when you find something that really grabs your                     |
| 15:57      | attention and gives your brain something to chew on, whether that's in the background                    |
| 16:01      | or the foreground.                                                                                       |
| 16:03      | If you're looking for a new show to listen to, Sync Up takes you behind the scenes of                     |
| 16:06      | OneDrive so you can learn about how to connect files, share your documents and work from                 |
| 16:11      | anywhere. And you'll get to hear about the design and development side of things too.                    |
| 16:15      | Each show covers a dedicated topic, guest interviews, news and announcements, plus a special topic       |
| 16:21      | outside the technology norm. And that's one of the things I really love about it.                        |
| 16:26      | Topics include data compliance and government, mobile productivity, working with iOS, Mac,               |
| 16:31      | Android and Windows, and of course automation, one of our favourites.                                     |
| 16:36      | In the February edition, they talked about working with customer success managers and                    |
| 16:40      | how to advise customers on using technologies like Teams and OneDrive, plus they did a little            |
| 16:45      | behind the scenes on their favourite article of pandemic clothing. Mine's a sweater, but                  |
| 16:50      | that's a topic for another time.                                                                         |
| 16:53      | Go and listen to it now. Just search for Sync Up wherever you get your podcasts. That's                   |

| 17:07      | All right, so we've convinced you to use [[Drafts]], but we haven't really got into the                      |
| 17:13      | good stuff you can do with [[Drafts]] to make capture more automated. So let's talk about                    |
| 17:18      | that a little bit. What are you doing with [[Drafts]] as Rosemary Orchard professional automator             |
| 17:26      | to make that a faster process?                                                                           |
| 17:28      | Well, I mean, the first thing is this double tap on the back of my iPhone. That just opens               |
| 17:33      | a new draft, and I'm right there. So from any application, I can literally just double                   |
| 17:39      | tap the back of my iPhone and do that.                                                                   |
| 17:42      | Okay, can I interrupt there?                                                                             |
| 17:44      | Really well.                                                                                             |
| 17:45      | Because I tried that, and I did it with just turning the light on on my phone with idea                  |
| 17:48      | if I could up in the middle of the night, I could turn the light on, but I kept getting                  |
| 17:53      | false positives. I pulled my phone in my pocket at two in the afternoon, the light would be              |
| 17:57      | on.                                                                                                      |
| 17:58      | Hmm.                                                                                                     |
| 18:00      | Do you have that happen?                                                                                 |
| 18:02      | So there's two kinds of things that you can do with this. So if you go into settings,                    |
| 18:10      | accessibility, back tap, and then you pick either double or triple, then there are system                |
| 18:15      | actions, there's accessibility actions, there's scroll gestures, and then there's shortcuts.             |
| 18:20      | Shortcuts, as far as I can tell, at least for something like opening [[Drafts]], need your                   |
| 18:25      | phone to be unlocked, which means that if your phone is in your pocket, your face isn't                  |
| 18:30      | in your pocket, so it's not going to unlock it.                                                          |
| 18:35      | And there hopefully are no faces in your pocket for a face ID to falsely detect you once                 |
| 18:39      | 14.5 releases.                                                                                           |
| 18:41      | So something like turning the flashlight on that doesn't need your phone to be unlocked.                 |
| 18:46      | But something like running a shortcut to open an application does.                                       |
| 18:51      | And so I am, I'm doing this, I do occasionally pick up my phone after I've just put it down,             |
| 18:57      | you know, while I'm cooking or something, and then I pick it up to check the next step,                  |
| 19:02      | I go, oh, [[Drafts]] is open because I put it down and the way that I put it down has triggered              |
| 19:06      | that double back tap.                                                                                    |
| 19:07      | But I find if I treat my device well, which is something that I try to do and I don't                    |
| 19:12      | throw it around, then there's very rarely falsely triggers for me.                                       |
| 19:16      | Yeah, that's interesting. So the necessity to unlock the phone actually makes it a more                  |
| 19:21      | useful feature.                                                                                          |
| 19:22      | I'm going to try that.                                                                                   |
| 19:23      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 19:24      | I'm going to try that.                                                                                   |
| 19:25      | Yeah, because I mean, it can't open an app unless your phone is unlocked.                                |
| 19:29      | So that works really well.                                                                               |
| 19:31      | And you might want to try assigning the flashlight to the triple back tap because that's still           |
| 19:36      | pretty easy to use in the night.                                                                         |
| 19:38      | You just tap three times, but it's less easy to trigger accidentally, which works quite                  |
| 19:44      | nicely.                                                                                                  |
| 19:45      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 19:46      | Well, so you're getting into the app pretty quick.                                                       |
| 19:49      | The way I do it is I've just got the widget on my, and I have a rotating widget on my                    |
| 19:55      | home screen.                                                                                             |
| 19:56      | It's the four shortcuts icons, or if I swipe it, it's [[Drafts]].                                            |
| 20:01      | And it's only two, the stack only has two items in it, [[Drafts]] and shortcuts.                             |
| 20:06      | So I can get to it pretty quickly.                                                                       |
| 20:08      | And like you, I use the eight button widget.                                                             |
| 20:11      | And the first one is by default inbox, and it's the one I press the most.                                |
| 20:15      | In fact, maybe I should rethink that and make it an even simpler widget because I don't                  |
| 20:21      | really use all the other buttons as much anymore.                                                        |
| 20:24      | So I don't know, but the, but yeah, either way, having a quick way to get in, you can                    |
| 20:29      | also do it with just having the app on your home screen.                                                 |
| 20:32      | You know, I just don't have any apps on my home screen right now.                                        |
| 20:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 20:35      | So [[Drafts]] has several widgets and I'm using the medium size eight button widget as well.                 |
| 20:41      | The other option would potentially be being listing what's in the contents of a specific                 |
| 20:46      | workspace or my inbox or displaying what's in a draft.                                                   |
| 20:50      | What I like about the eight button one is by default, it has the inbox, creating a new                   |
| 20:53      | draft, dictation and search, but you can, you can change those buttons up to do whatever                 |
| 21:00      | you need.                                                                                                |
| 21:02      | So if you tap and hold on the widget, then you can tap edit it and then you can actually                 |
| 21:06      | change things so that you open, for example, your specific inbox workspace instead of the                |
| 21:13      | default inbox or something like that.                                                                    |
| 21:17      | I actually have my processing inbox right there, which is great.                                         |
| 21:20      | And that's anything that isn't tagged and then it opens a specific action group as well.                 |
| 21:27      | So I've got that.                                                                                        |
| 21:28      | And that's another way because I've also got the dictation button on there because sometimes             |
| 21:31      | the easiest way to capture is with dictation.                                                            |
| 21:34      | And of course, the beauty of this is [[Drafts]] has the magic dictation loop where you can                   |
| 21:38      | talk and they just doesn't time out.                                                                     |
| 21:40      | So I can be talking for a couple of minutes and it's capturing it.                                       |
| 21:43      | It doesn't necessarily do a great job.                                                                   |
| 21:45      | So I'm not going to do this for something that is mission critical unless I'm supervising                |
| 21:51      | it.                                                                                                      |
| 21:52      | But for things like notes about what I'm cooking so that I can modify the recipe later, that's           |
| 21:59      | fine.                                                                                                    |
| 22:01      | And it works out pretty well for me.                                                                     |
| 22:03      | You know, I think [[Drafts]] is a remarkable widget implementation and there's so many different             |
| 22:09      | kinds.                                                                                                   |
| 22:10      | I mean, you can go from the very smallest with just inbox to the very largest with so                    |
| 22:15      | many buttons.                                                                                            |
| 22:16      | If you've gone all in with [[Drafts]], for instance, making [[Drafts]] your reference system and you've          |
| 22:20      | got a bunch of workspaces, you can access all of them right from the widget.                             |
| 22:24      | So that is a form of automation, I would argue.                                                          |
| 22:28      | Yes, absolutely.                                                                                         |
| 22:30      | And it works really nicely for this too.                                                                 |
| 22:32      | I've not had any issues with it at all.                                                                  |
| 22:36      | And I do keep a lot of things in [[Drafts]], which is why I have my own custom inbox, which                  |
| 22:40      | is everything that isn't tagged because things that stay in [[Drafts]] have got a tag on them.               |
| 22:47      | And so that allows me to filter things out.                                                              |
| 22:49      | So I go from thousands of notes to just the notes that need processing, of which there                   |
| 22:53      | are of course still too many, but I'm working on getting to inbox zero there.                            |
| 22:58      | Well, like I'm just the opposite with [[Drafts]].                                                            |
| 23:02      | I actually badge the app, which is very rare for me, but I badge it with any inbox items.                |
| 23:08      | And then when I see the widget, it shows me the count on my inbox, which annoys the heck                 |
| 23:13      | out of me.                                                                                               |
| 23:14      | And part of my shutdown procedure every day is going through and emptying the [[Drafts]].                    |
| 23:19      | I think that really is part of the automated capture for me in that I need to at the end                 |
| 23:23      | of the day empty [[Drafts]].                                                                                 |
| 23:25      | [[Drafts]] is not the spot where these things linger because if I don't get my agreement                     |
| 23:30      | to make that client contract an OmniFocus, I'm never going to do it.                                    |
| 23:34      | So it's real important that I process it.                                                                |
| 23:37      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 23:38      | That makes a lot of sense.                                                                               |
| 23:39      | And I would suggest that for most people, it should be the same or similar just because                  |
| 23:45      | capture is part of a process.                                                                            |
| 23:47      | It's not the end point.                                                                                  |
| 23:48      | At the very least, you should say, hey, this is a piece of reference material and market                 |
| 23:53      | as such so that it's distinguishable from all of the other stuff that you have hanging                   |
| 23:58      | around, which is one of the reasons why I've relatively recently started using [[Obsidian]],                 |
| 24:05      | which I sync through [[Dropbox]] because then I can have things go easily to [[Obsidian]] from                   |
| 24:11      | [[Drafts]] because I just save it to a [[Dropbox]] folder.                                                       |
| 24:14      | Or for work, I'm actually saving it to own cloud because [[Drafts]] can do that as well.                     |
| 24:19      | [[Obsidian]] can just point at any folder on your Mac and that works perfectly for work.                     |
| 24:23      | So I'm pretty happy about that.                                                                          |
| 24:24      | Actually, let's talk about that right now because that is an interesting part of the                     |
| 24:29      | capture process is where you've got these text files that you've saved in [[Drafts]], but                    |
| 24:34      | you've got a particular place you need them to be.                                                       |
| 24:37      | And depending on the apps you're working with, that really can be an issue.                              |
| 24:42      | An app that is [[Dropbox]] friendly like [[Obsidian]] makes it really easy because [[Drafts]] has [[Dropbox]]            |
| 24:48      | systems built in.                                                                                        |
| 24:49      | The way I use [[Obsidian]] is I actually use, because I've got client notes in it, I use                     |
| 24:54      | their end-to-end encrypted product, I pay extra, and I have my own password for my data.                 |
| 24:59      | So if you got on any server, you wouldn't be able to access it.                                          |
| 25:04      | But what that means is I can't easily write to the cloud with [[Obsidian]] data because it's                 |
| 25:09      | all encrypted.                                                                                           |
| 25:12      | But the way my data is stored, it's stored locally on my drive on a protected drive.                     |
| 25:18      | But that drive is not anywhere in the cloud.                                                             |
| 25:23      | It's off iCloud, it's off [[Dropbox]], but then [[Obsidian]] sends it up to a cloud service that                 |
| 25:29      | they provide for a fee that holds the encrypted data.                                                    |
| 25:34      | And so for me to write to my [[Obsidian]] data on Mac, I actually have end [[Drafts]] save local                 |
| 25:41      | saves of markdown files to that particular folder on my local folder.                                    |
| 25:46      | I can't do any of the cool [[Dropbox]] stuff Rose does, but that's the way I'm able to use the               |
| 25:52      | app for the stuff I need to use with encryption.                                                         |
| 25:55      | So like I looked at Roam and Kraft, and a lot of these are great services, but they don't                |
| 26:01      | offer that end-to-end encryption, so I couldn't use them.                                                |
| 26:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 26:05      | And that is something that you potentially need to be aware of with any of these things                  |
| 26:10      | of what you're capturing is sensitive, then you need to make sure it's right.                            |
| 26:16      | In the case of work, I never really capture anything that's actually sensitive.                          |
| 26:21      | But for example, the fact that our web server is running PHP 7.4 instead of PHP 8 is super               |
| 26:26      | sensitive, then I think we're going to have a much bigger issue than the fact that we're                 |
| 26:31      | running 7.4, because it's still supported.                                                               |
| 26:37      | But I'm just trying to stick with good practices of work stuff goes up here and other stuff              |
| 26:42      | goes over there, but because I've set things up, so I have inside of my [[Obsidian]] folder,                 |
| 26:49      | I have a folder or instead of my [[Obsidian]] vault, which is basically a folder.                            |
| 26:55      | I have a folder called lists, and this contains, surprise, a series of lists.                            |
| 27:00      | So this is stuff like TV shows to watch, books to read, things like that.                                |
| 27:04      | And I am constantly experimenting with where these things go, but at the moment I'm really               |
| 27:08      | happy with them being there, because I've built a custom [[Dropbox]] action, which finds                     |
| 27:13      | all of the markdown files in that folder, and it shows them to me as a list.                             |
| 27:18      | And then it appends, whatever is in my current draft, minus read or watch or whatever, and               |
| 27:28      | just removing any white space after that's been nuked.                                                   |
| 27:32      | And it appends that to one of those lists.                                                               |
| 27:36      | And that makes it really easy for me to just have all these things, because I'm very fortunate           |
| 27:43      | in that for my personal stuff, I can use [[Dropbox]].                                                        |
| 27:46      | And so I love it, because that works, and it means that I both captured to the right                     |
| 27:53      | place, but then when I'm looking for the data, it's going to be really easy to find.                     |
| 27:58      | And of course, because I'm using [[Dropbox]], I'm not married to [[Obsidian]], I can then just                   |
| 28:02      | open the entire folder in [[BBEdit]] or Nova or something else if I want to.                                 |
| 28:09      | And I can, of course, open individual files anytime, and I can even get stuff with shortcuts,            |
| 28:13      | which is pretty handy.                                                                                   |
| 28:14      | Now, I totally agree.                                                                                    |
| 28:17      | There's part of me that thinks I should just separate the legal vault to the encrypted                   |
| 28:21      | database and put a personal vault somewhere like [[Dropbox]], but it's so much easier having                 |
| 28:26      | it all in one place.                                                                                     |
| 28:28      | And so I'll err on the side of caution, just make it all encrypted.                                      |
| 28:32      | But the point you made there, I think, which is helpful for automators, is you're capturing              |
| 28:37      | with [[Drafts]].                                                                                             |
| 28:38      | Well, it's great.                                                                                        |
| 28:40      | [[Drafts]] is great.                                                                                         |
| 28:41      | Like I said earlier, you open it, you can just dictate right into it and get it out.                     |
| 28:43      | And they have a sharing button to get the data shared.                                                   |
| 28:46      | But if you have a paid account and you start using custom actions, [[Drafts]] like goes to                   |
| 28:52      | a whole new level for automated capture.                                                                 |
| 28:55      | The ability to easily make actions, I think, is very underrated by a lot of people listening             |
| 29:01      | to this show.                                                                                            |
| 29:03      | It is super easy.                                                                                        |
| 29:04      | You go online and you look at sample actions and you're like, oh my gosh, these guys are                 |
| 29:09      | writing massive JavaScript and I'm not going to be able to do that and it's just going                   |
| 29:13      | to break.                                                                                                |
| 29:14      | I'm going to waste a bunch of time.                                                                      |
| 29:15      | So I'm not going to do that.                                                                             |
| 29:16      | But like, capture is a great example.                                                                    |
| 29:18      | Like I have one for client phone calls, right?                                                           |
| 29:22      | And all of this is templated, you know, you can template text in a draft action.                         |
| 29:27      | You don't have to write any JavaScript to do that.                                                       |
| 29:29      | All you do is say, insert template text and in there, you can put variables like the current             |
| 29:35      | date and time.                                                                                           |
| 29:36      | So like as soon as a client calls me or since I hang up from a client, I open a draft.                   |
| 29:40      | I hit the action item for client call.                                                                   |
| 29:43      | It puts in a date and timestamp.                                                                         |
| 29:45      | It lets me insert the client's name.                                                                     |
| 29:47      | It then has a list of things like prompts or what did we discuss?                                        |
| 29:52      | What are my action items following it?                                                                   |
| 29:55      | All this stuff, I can just write that in and then I press one button and it saves that                   |
| 30:00      | out as a markdown file to what's in essence my inbox and [[Obsidian]] and that gets synced                   |
| 30:06      | through the end and encrypted, you know, encryption.                                                     |
| 30:09      | And it just happens that fast and it's just awesome, you know, and I really find that                    |
| 30:16      | the ability to create these custom actions can make your capture so much more efficient                  |
| 30:21      | and accurate.                                                                                            |
| 30:22      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 30:24      | And that's the thing, you know, I've done some little tweaks.                                            |
| 30:27      | So usually the way if you share something from [[Safari]] to [[Drafts]], it would usually create                 |
| 30:32      | a markdown link with the title of the page as the name of the link, the URL and brackets                 |
| 30:39      | and then a quote and the quote would be whatever selected.                                               |
| 30:42      | And if you've got nothing selected, you end up with this empty quote mark.                               |
| 30:45      | Well, I almost never have anything selected.                                                             |
| 30:50      | So I decided that first of all, I was going to get rid of the quote mark because if I've                 |
| 30:55      | got something selected, it just lands in the body of the note and I can manually add the                 |
| 30:58      | quote mark.                                                                                              |
| 30:59      | But otherwise I'm just going to start typing and I don't want, you know, there to be this                |
| 31:04      | and random empty quote there, but I also realised that because of the way that I name things             |
| 31:11      | and usually if I'm looking, if I've got a link and I want to save it, then I want the                    |
| 31:15      | title of the page as the name, be that the file name or the task name.                                   |
| 31:22      | And I will probably, in fact, almost certainly modify it, but I like having that as a base               |
| 31:28      | because it's very easy to just delete a couple of words or add a few words at the beginning.             |
| 31:34      | And then go from there.                                                                                  |
| 31:37      | So what I have done is I've modified this and this is something you can do in the draft                  |
| 31:41      | preferences.                                                                                             |
| 31:42      | I can't remember precisely where it is right now, of course.                                             |
| 31:48      | But there is a way to do this where, yeah, it's under extensions, at least on the Mac.                   |
| 31:54      | So I've just got it, it's got the hash on the space, which is a H1 title and then the                    |
| 31:58      | title tag.                                                                                               |
| 31:59      | And then under that, it's got the URL format because I like that that will, you know, it                 |
| 32:06      | doesn't necessarily get parsed when I send it to OmniFocus, it's just, it's plain text,                  |
| 32:13      | but I can read it, it's marked down, marked down as plain text works really well.                        |
| 32:17      | And then if it's in [[Obsidian]] and I'm using the preview, then of course it's nicely clickable.            |
| 32:22      | And then underneath that, there's a selection, but I changed that because that works better              |
| 32:25      | with my workflow.                                                                                        |
| 32:26      | And that's, I think, the key part of Capture.                                                            |
| 32:29      | You need to have, or automate a Capture, you need to tweak your tools to work for you.                   |
| 32:34      | Yeah, I have so many text entry templates and [[Drafts]] where things are going to maybe                     |
| 32:39      | go into [[Day One]] or [[Obsidian]] or even maybe an OmniFocus task, but I customise everything                  |
| 32:47      | in the template forms in [[Drafts]] so I can do as much of the work automatically without                    |
| 32:52      | me having to type in.                                                                                    |
| 32:54      | Which is so useful using this text, it's just not a difficult action at all.                             |
| 32:59      | The trick is you save it, if it's where it's sitting, you save it as a markdown file, maybe              |
| 33:03      | some other places you save it as text.                                                                   |
| 33:06      | Another thing is like one wrinkle on this for me is if I'm on my Mac, I can save it directly             |
| 33:11      | to the [[Obsidian]] file, but if I'm on my iOS device, I can't because I don't have access                   |
| 33:17      | to it because of the ended encryption, so I save it to a particular folder and then                      |
| 33:22      | I've got [[Hazel]] doing work on the Mac to get it to the right place.                                       |
| 33:28      | That's the most complicated way you could do it.                                                         |
| 33:30      | That's only because I've added all this end-to-end nonsense.                                             |
| 33:34      | If you're just doing it in [[Dropbox]], it would be easier.                                                  |
| 33:39      | But create some actions.                                                                                 |
| 33:40      | I've got a whole list of them for [[Obsidian]] entries, so if I come across a website and                    |
| 33:46      | I want to write a blog post about it, I push out a shortcut that opens a draft where it                  |
| 33:56      | saves the name of the post, the URL in a summary, and then from there, I may write the post              |
| 34:02      | or just save it into [[Obsidian]] and write the post there.                                                  |
| 34:05      | But the whole thing is just quick capture, getting the data I need, and moving on.                       |
| 34:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 34:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 34:13      | And that's the thing, it's about being able to do this really, really quickly.                           |
| 34:17      | So a lot of the time, I will share it directly to [[Drafts]], but whenever I want a specific                 |
| 34:22      | format, it's been very, very easy for me to either write a draft section, which takes,                   |
| 34:29      | it parses what's in the draft and manipulates that to be whatever I want.                                |
| 34:36      | Or most of the time, like you, I write shortcuts.                                                        |
| 34:40      | And I've tried to experiment with expanding this a little bit on macOS and writing custom                |
| 34:46      | bookmarklets.                                                                                            |
| 34:47      | Sure.                                                                                                    |
| 34:48      | Bookmarklets are essentially JavaScript that you can click to do something.                              |
| 34:53      | And there are lots of examples out there that you can find of bookmarklets.                              |
| 34:56      | I mean, we actually have one for Relay FM, where I can click a magic button and it appends               |
| 35:02      | a link to the Automator show notes.                                                                      |
| 35:05      | And that's how I just added my custom action for appending to a list, which I should caveat              |
| 35:12      | that that's saving it very specifically to a custom folder of mine.                                      |
| 35:15      | So you will need to edit that if you want to use that action.                                            |
| 35:20      | But you should do that because it's very easy to do it.                                                  |
| 35:23      | I've already written it for you.                                                                         |
| 35:24      | I will say that my code is not the best, but it was something I wrote quickly and it works.              |
| 35:29      | But a lot of the time now, I find that I'm using handoff to pick up the [[Safari]] page on                   |
| 35:35      | my iPhone.                                                                                               |
| 35:36      | And then I send it to shortcuts, which manipulate stuff and chucks it into [[Drafts]].                       |
| 35:41      | It adds an extra step, but I've then got everything in the format that I desire on my phone or           |
| 35:51      | in [[Drafts]] specifically so that I can then send it wherever I need it to go.                              |
| 35:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 35:56      | Well, I mean, this is an example of one of the things where automation is easier on iOS                  |
| 36:00      | than it is on the Mac because we don't have shortcuts on the Mac.                                        |
| 36:04      | And shortcuts parses the entire website for you and you just build out a text file that                  |
| 36:09      | says title and you insert the title that you pull out with the shortcut.                                 |
| 36:14      | Rather than monkeying around with JavaScript that may break with the next JavaScript update              |
| 36:18      | or next time you update your Mac for some reason, it may stop working.                                   |
| 36:23      | The shortcuts method is faster to create and more reliable.                                              |
| 36:26      | So I find myself doing the same.                                                                         |
| 36:28      | What I do if I'm on my Mac and I see something that I want to act on, I actually just say                |
| 36:34      | save it to reading list because I actually put my read later into Instapaper.                            |
| 36:39      | Reading list is just like, here's a link that I need to act on one way or another.                       |
| 36:44      | And sometimes it's something that's easier for me to act on on the Mac so then I clear                   |
| 36:48      | it out there or sometimes it's easier to act on on mobile, but I check that and try and                  |
| 36:54      | keep it empty.                                                                                           |
| 36:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 36:56      | That makes a lot of sense.                                                                               |
| 36:57      | I find that if I do that, then I'm committing a GTD sin, which is I'm trying to let my brain             |
| 37:02      | remember why I've got it.                                                                                |
| 37:05      | So if I just throw something into [[Drafts]] and then say, process this with X shortcut, by                  |
| 37:12      | the time I've done that, I could have just done the handoff, added it, dealt with it                     |
| 37:19      | through the shortcut and be done with it.                                                                |
| 37:22      | So I'm finding that there is some merit to doing that, but at the same time, I found                     |
| 37:29      | that it doesn't necessarily always pay off for me because my brain's then trying to remember             |
| 37:33      | things and my brain's not very good at remembering things.                                               |
| 37:37      | It turns out this is why I capture it because I'm capturing it so that I will actually remember          |
| 37:41      | it.                                                                                                      |
| 37:42      | And I find if I've captured it properly, then I will remember it.                                        |
| 37:44      | If I don't capture properly, then things go wrong.                                                       |
| 37:46      | So for me, the critical component is the daily shutdown.                                                 |
| 37:50      | If you listen to the focus podcast, Mike, and I talk about this a lot, but I have to                     |
| 37:55      | do the day in shutdown.                                                                                  |
| 37:56      | And part of it is I have a whole checklist and I'll check reading list if there's anything               |
| 38:01      | to do.                                                                                                   |
| 38:02      | Because if I did it that day, I'll remember and get it done if I have to empty out the                   |
| 38:07      | [[Drafts]] inbox.                                                                                            |
| 38:08      | But if I wait a week and I go and look at a draft that I wrote a week ago, there's a                     |
| 38:12      | good chance I'm not going to know what the heck that's there for.                                        |
| 38:14      | So I have to do it on a daily basis.                                                                     |
| 38:18      | I don't know if that's automation or not, but that is a key.                                             |
| 38:21      | Well, I think a good chunk of automation is building good habits, right?                                 |
| 38:25      | Because a habit is pretty much an automation.                                                            |
| 38:27      | If something is a habit for you, then you will remember to do it.                                        |
| 38:32      | And it will just be done.                                                                                |
| 38:34      | And that's the beauty of productivity and automation.                                                    |
| 38:38      | They are a great intersection in many, many ways.                                                        |
| 38:42      | Either way, [[Drafts]] actions are, to me, the secret sauce of automating capture.                           |
| 38:50      | Because you just create a whole bunch of these templates.                                                |
| 38:54      | I even do it for the templates, like [[Obsidian]] has a built-in template system, which is also              |
| 39:00      | kind of automated capture if you want it to be, but I'm not necessarily in [[Obsidian]] all                  |
| 39:05      | the time.                                                                                                |
| 39:06      | And so I've recreated those all in [[Drafts]] with [[Drafts]] quick capture templates.                           |
| 39:12      | And I've just got a whole menu of them and I can pick any one of them.                                   |
| 39:15      | So if I'm laying in bed and I think of something I want to capture, I'll just open up [[Drafts]],            |
| 39:21      | pick the appropriate [[Obsidian]] template and dictate into it.                                              |
| 39:24      | And all this stuff is just, the trick is putting a little time in the head of time.                      |
| 39:30      | So when that moment of inspiration hits you, you can get that idea captured with the least               |
| 39:37      | amount of friction.                                                                                      |

| 40:50      | We're talking a lot today about [[Drafts]], but did you know [[Drafts]] has built-in TextExpander                |
| 40:54      | support?                                                                                                 |

| 41:25      | Our thanks to TextExpander and Smile for their support of the Automators and all of Relay                |
| 41:29      | FM.                                                                                                      |
| 41:30      | So, David, I think we need to talk about more ways that we automate capture, because there               |
| 41:37      | are lots of ways.                                                                                        |
| 41:38      | And I touched on this a little bit earlier, but I say, hey [[Apple]] lady, and use that as                   |
| 41:45      | a capture method.                                                                                        |
| 41:47      | This may not sound super automated, but when I break it down, it actually is.                            |
| 41:54      | So I'll do that.                                                                                         |
| 41:55      | First of all, I have, you know, add this to my shopping list, so for example, add bananas                |
| 42:01      | to my shopping list, and that goes into a shopping list in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                    |
| 42:06      | And then I actually do have a shortcut that can pull those items into OmniFocus, because                 |
| 42:12      | a lot of my things to purchase do end up in OmniFocus.                                                   |
| 42:16      | Some people don't think that's best practice.                                                            |
| 42:17      | I personally think whatever system works for you is best practice.                                       |
| 42:21      | And this works for me, because it means that I get reminders when I'm near a store if I've               |
| 42:25      | got something to buy there, which is the important part.                                                 |
| 42:28      | I don't want reminders for a store if there's nothing to purchase there.                                 |
| 42:33      | But then, so I have the shopping list, and that's easy, but then everything else pretty                  |
| 42:38      | much lands in a single default list, which I have linked to the Jew app.                                 |
| 42:44      | And for people not familiar with it, the Jew app nags you.                                               |
| 42:47      | So you set up a default, mines every five minutes, and then if you don't mark something                  |
| 42:54      | is done when it tells you to do it, it'll come back five minutes later and go do it.                     |
| 42:59      | And I use this for a certain thing.                                                                      |
| 43:02      | So recently, I had to take a course of medication and is antibiotic, so you need to take them            |
| 43:07      | at the right time and stuff like that.                                                                   |
| 43:09      | So I used shortcuts, actually, in that particular case, to add a series of tasks to [[Due]], which           |
| 43:16      | it then nagged me for.                                                                                   |
| 43:17      | But [[Due]] can automatically, or can look at a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list and anything with a date                      |
| 43:22      | and time, it will just grab for you.                                                                     |
| 43:25      | And that's perfect.                                                                                      |
| 43:28      | And I decided that, very occasionally, I do want reminders when I get to a location,                     |
| 43:32      | and I like using [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] for this because it stays on the home screen of my phone until                |
| 43:36      | either I leave the location or until I mark it off, unlike OmniFocus, where this is an                   |
| 43:42      | iOS limitation.                                                                                          |
| 43:43      | It just appears once, and then it goes away.                                                             |
| 43:46      | And so I ask it to do that.                                                                              |
| 43:49      | And then I have a shortcut, which I run every 15 minutes through push cut.                               |
| 43:53      | I could probably just hook this to the open [[Drafts]] action, but it looks for any reminders                |
| 43:59      | in this list, which doesn't have an alert.                                                               |
| 44:02      | Now an alert could be a date or a daytime, or it could be a location.                                    |
| 44:07      | So anything that doesn't have that, it will create a draft for each of them, and then                    |
| 44:12      | it actually deletes it, the reminder.                                                                    |
| 44:16      | [[Drafts]] can automatically import things from a reminders list, but if it does that, it                    |
| 44:20      | will just grab everything, which includes potentially ones that haven't yet been sucked                  |
| 44:25      | into due, which should have been, and ones which have got location-based reminders on,                   |
| 44:30      | which I don't want it to do.                                                                             |
| 44:31      | So I do this manually.                                                                                   |
| 44:33      | And that works really, really well for me, because then I can say, hey, remind me to                     |
| 44:41      | clean the spot on the living room curtain.                                                               |
| 44:43      | I'd noticed there was a blue spot on my living room curtain the other day.                               |
| 44:46      | And so I need to clean that.                                                                             |
| 44:47      | And I just use the Hey Magic Lady trick for that.                                                        |
| 44:51      | And then it appeared in due, and as I was going through and processing my inbox, I was like,             |
| 44:55      | oh yeah, yeah, actually, you know what, that's a couple of minutes.                                      |
| 44:57      | I'll just do that right now.                                                                             |
| 44:59      | And obviously I hadn't been able to do it before, hence capturing it.                                    |
| 45:02      | But that I have found has been a very nice setup for me.                                                 |
| 45:07      | I've got lots of applications in there doing things, but this now just happens entirely                  |
| 45:12      | in the background without me thinking about it, which is amazing.                                        |
| 45:15      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 45:16      | I want to pull that apart.                                                                               |
| 45:17      | So the starting point is you're using Siri, and it's excellent integration with the [[Apple Reminders]]  |
| 45:24      | app as a quick capture.                                                                        |
| 45:27      | It seems like that's the reason you're doing this, right?                                                |
| 45:29      | I mean, rather than going to specific apps.                                                              |
| 45:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 45:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 45:33      | Because you can say, hey, [[Apple]] Lady, create a note in [[Drafts]].                                           |
| 45:40      | But that's more words than, well, it's actually the same number of words as remind me to,                |
| 45:46      | or pretty much.                                                                                          |
| 45:48      | But I just find that remind me to is easy syntax.                                                        |
| 45:53      | And I don't need to think about, you know, which app is this going into?                                 |
| 45:58      | It's just, this is a reminder.                                                                           |
| 46:00      | And a reminder for me is anything from, you know, cook beef at six o'clock to, you know,                 |
| 46:10      | do a freezer inventory or clean that spot in the living room curtains.                                   |
| 46:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 46:15      | Obviously, the problem is in my experience is when you go to third party apps, it's like                 |
| 46:20      | one more point of failure in the process.                                                                |
| 46:23      | So you need number one to get Siri to understand you're trying to go to this third party app             |
| 46:28      | and then number two, get the text into the app.                                                          |
| 46:31      | And so often it's at that first step that it fails and you feel ridiculous and it makes                  |
| 46:36      | you crazy that you're sitting there talking and it's putting stuff in the wrong place                    |
| 46:40      | or not, you know, getting it right.                                                                      |
| 46:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 46:43      | So what that is, of course, this is running pretty much on HomePods because unless I'm                  |
| 46:46      | wearing headphones, the HomePods take priority and HomePods don't run apps.                            |
| 46:50      | So while theoretically they can't pass it off to an iPhone or an iPad, which will deal                   |
| 46:55      | with it, I found sometimes they don't.                                                                   |
| 46:57      | That's a bit of a, you know, thing where it's just not clicking quite as it should.                      |
| 47:02      | And I don't know exactly where the problem is, but [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] works 10 out of 10 times.                   |
| 47:06      | So I've stuck with the simple solution.                                                                  |
| 47:09      | So that's a third point of failure.                                                                      |
| 47:10      | It's like it's got to then go from the HomePod to the mobile device and, you know, something's          |
| 47:15      | going to break.                                                                                          |
| 47:16      | So, so you've identified, I can take a three step process and turn to one start process                  |
| 47:21      | if I just go into the native app.                                                                        |
| 47:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 47:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 47:25      | Absolutely.                                                                                              |
| 47:26      | Then you're parsing out of the native app.                                                               |
| 47:27      | This is the part I want to kind of pick apart.                                                           |
| 47:29      | So, so for do, I have not, I use do as well, like I talked earlier about the importance                  |
| 47:36      | of a shutdown.                                                                                           |
| 47:37      | I have a do reminder at the end of the day, shut it down.                                                |
| 47:40      | And then I've got a, you know, a checklist that I go through at that point.                              |
| 47:44      | I don't make do items or every item on the checklist.                                                    |
| 47:47      | It's just get started with the shutdown, but you are actually pulling items that are date                |
| 47:53      | related out of [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and putting them into do automatically.                                         |
| 47:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 47:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 47:58      | And this is a native feature of due.                                                                     |
| 47:59      | I didn't really do anything for this.                                                                    |
| 48:01      | So if you open due in the, in the sidebar under a settings, I believe, then there should                 |
| 48:09      | be an option under, um, so there's import where you can specifically import everything                   |
| 48:14      | in one list, but there's also auto import where you can select a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list, um,                     |
| 48:20      | and it will, it will then attempt to import that.                                                        |
| 48:22      | And I set my background app refresh, uh, to, to maximum because, you know, I'm not going                 |
| 48:27      | anywhere and I've got a max iPhone.                                                                      |
| 48:29      | And once there's a max a battery pack, uh, released, then there'll be one of those in                    |
| 48:32      | my bag at all times, um, along with the watch charging cable, because that will pretty much              |
| 48:37      | do, um, uh, you know, obviously the more frequently that you do this, the, the more battery it           |
| 48:43      | uses, but that's fine.                                                                                   |
| 48:44      | Um, and, uh, I also, um, when we, when we get to another part later, I have a shortcuts,                 |
| 48:50      | uh, just open the due app and then pop back to shortcuts, um, on a, on a secondary device                |
| 48:55      | just because, um, it, it makes sure that it grabs it because whenever it opens it, it's                  |
| 48:59      | like, oh yeah, hey, I should actually do this now.                                                       |
| 49:01      | Um, and then it's done.                                                                                  |
| 49:03      | And then what is the spoken syntax you use to your HomePod to not only save a reminder,                 |
| 49:09      | but put it in the proper list?                                                                           |
| 49:11      | Well, that's the thing.                                                                                  |
| 49:12      | I don't, um, unless it's something that I need to purchase in which case it's add this                   |
| 49:16      | to my shopping list, um, then, um, uh, all the, all the, the rest of the time, it literally              |
| 49:23      | just goes into one list, um, because I'm trying the keep it, uh, really, really simple approach,         |
| 49:29      | um, which is basically I have two lists.                                                                 |
| 49:32      | I have my shopping list and I have everything else and everything else is then handled automatically.    |
| 49:37      | Do you know if something has got a due time, then it, it, it grabs it and that's it.                     |
| 49:43      | It's done.                                                                                               |
| 49:44      | It, it goes, yeah, this, this belongs here and it just handles that for me.                              |
| 49:48      | And then the rest of it is handled through shortcut that I've programmed.                                |
| 49:51      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 49:52      | So the first thing, so that we're addressing time related reminders through due and then                 |
| 49:57      | you had your addressing location related to reminders, just by leaving them in the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]             |
| 50:02      | app, right?                                                                                              |
| 50:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:05      | Absolutely.                                                                                              |
| 50:06      | Um, because, you know, this is really handy, um, and, uh, I leave them alone, um, and shortcuts          |
| 50:10      | I found can, so in shortcuts, it can be a bit tricky to find whether or not a, uh, reminder              |
| 50:16      | has got a location associated with it.                                                                   |
| 50:18      | But if a reminder has an alert associated with it, that is possible and a location triggers              |
| 50:23      | an alert.                                                                                                |
| 50:24      | Um, and therefore I found the, the trick for this is to look for reminders with no alert.                |
| 50:31      | Um, and then I repeat with each, I added to [[Drafts]] and I deleted inside of that repeat                   |
| 50:37      | loop.                                                                                                    |
| 50:38      | Um, and then finally at the end, um, it opens due and then it bounces back to [[Drafts]] and                 |
| 50:43      | then, uh, that, that shortcut finishes.                                                                  |
| 50:45      | Clever.                                                                                                  |
| 50:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:47      | It just forces everything to end up in the right place.                                                  |
| 50:49      | I should probably, uh, have it add to due, uh, open due right at the beginning.                          |
| 50:55      | Um, because what, what I've done is this is running on, um, I, I purchased an iPod touch                 |
| 51:00      | recently, David, uh, because I realised I needed another iPhone for recording, um, uh,                   |
| 51:06      | screencast online things and I only have my push cut server one, uh, and I had to wipe                   |
| 51:10      | it because I needed a different account and, uh, there, there was a whole thing and I thought            |
| 51:14      | this is really annoying.                                                                                 |
| 51:16      | That is one of the cheapest iOS devices that I can purchase that will make my life easier.               |
| 51:20      | So I am the proud owner of a gold iPod touch sitting here on my desk, um, which is just                  |
| 51:27      | running push cut automation server, shortcuts, [[Drafts]], due, um, and a couple of other apps,              |
| 51:32      | uh, like Scriptable, um, Toolbox Pro, things like that.                                                  |
| 51:36      | Anything that basically allows my, my automations to work magically.                                     |
| 51:40      | So I've got an automation set up that whenever the due app opens, it waits 10 seconds on                 |
| 51:44      | the open shortcuts, um, and I also have, uh, similar things actually for several other                   |
| 51:49      | applications, including the Eve app, uh, because that opens periodically to make sure that               |
| 51:54      | all of my data is grabbed, um, uh, because when we talked to Merlin Mann on the show,                     |
| 51:58      | he said, you know, sometimes you just lose data from the Eve app.                                        |
| 52:01      | So I've got it just opening periodically on this iPhone, uh, so that I always have that                  |
| 52:05      | data.                                                                                                    |
| 52:06      | I forgot that they were even selling those still.                                                        |
| 52:09      | Uh, well, yep, uh, I mean the iPod touch, I wouldn't say that it's an amazing device.                    |
| 52:15      | It does not have touch ID or face ID.                                                                    |
| 52:17      | So that means that every time it's locked, I have to type in the passcode, but at the                    |
| 52:21      | same time it's sitting here running an app 24 seven.                                                     |
| 52:24      | It very rarely needs my passcode, uh, only to install updates and things like that.                      |
| 52:29      | Um, and I also made the, uh, perhaps crazy decision that none of the apps on this or                     |
| 52:35      | the operating system should be running a beta, which does mean every software and I                      |
| 52:39      | get myself into slightly hairy, uh, positions where shortcuts action exists, uh, and then                |
| 52:44      | I try to run it on my server and the, the action does not exist because it's, uh, it's                   |
| 52:49      | still in beta, but most of the time those things aren't running through Pushcut anyway.                |
| 52:53      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 52:54      | So on behalf of the audience and myself, can I ask that you share your shortcut where you're             |
| 52:58      | just so I can see the steps, uh, for getting the things to, um, to [[Drafts]]?                               |
| 53:03      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 53:04      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 53:05      | The link for that will indeed be in the show notes.                                                      |
| 53:07      | Well, that's, that's really clever as I don't do any of that stuff.                                      |
| 53:10      | Honestly, I, I, I, uh, lift my wrist to my, my, my mouth and I talk into [[Drafts]].                         |
| 53:17      | That's, and everything goes in, let's go in there and everything.                                        |
| 53:20      | And to tell you the truth, I have so few time related, like do short cause that, like I've               |
| 53:26      | got like in due right now, I've got every, after remind myself every Thursday night to                   |
| 53:31      | get the trash on the street for the trash collector, I, every day I remind myself to                     |
| 53:35      | shut down at the end of the day and, and I'd like to turn that off.                                      |
| 53:39      | I had it turned off for a while and then I found myself getting out of the habit of                      |
| 53:42      | shutting down.                                                                                           |
| 53:43      | So I had to like go back to discipline, but I just, I just don't use it for a whole lot.                 |
| 53:48      | But the stuff I do use it for, it's, it's super useful.                                                  |
| 53:51      | And just like you said, if you're taking some special medication or if you're doing something            |
| 53:56      | where you just want your phone to bug the hell out of you, if you don't do it, do is                     |
| 54:00      | the answer.                                                                                              |
| 54:01      | That's my endorsement right there.                                                                       |
| 54:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 54:04      | That's the thing.                                                                                        |
| 54:05      | I'm not choosing the right app for, for the right use case.                                              |
| 54:09      | And I have found if I'm asking you to remind me of something, then, or sorry, if I'm asking              |
| 54:18      | [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] to remind me of something, then that means that I probably need to do it very                  |
| 54:25      | specifically at that time done.                                                                          |
| 54:28      | And that means that it shouldn't land in omnifocus.                                                      |
| 54:32      | There are very occasionally exceptions to this rule, but that's occasional.                              |
| 54:39      | So I don't worry about that.                                                                             |
| 54:41      | And I just say, you know what?                                                                           |
| 54:42      | If I'm saying remind me to do this at this time, it goes into you done.                                  |
| 54:46      | And you know, when I do my, when I do my daily clear out, then I open you to, to take a look             |
| 54:51      | at what's in there.                                                                                      |
| 54:52      | And every so often I will see something and go, you know what?                                           |
| 54:55      | This belongs to this project.                                                                            |
| 54:56      | I'm going to put this in OmniFocus and delete it over here, but it's rare, very rare.                    |
| 54:59      | Well, I think, as always, Rosemary Orchard is one of the cleverest automators I know.                    |
| 55:05      | And you always surprise me with cool stuff like this.                                                    |
| 55:07      | Well, thank you.                                                                                         |
| 55:09      | And I would just like to say for people going, oh gosh, that shortcut that parses the reminders          |
| 55:14      | sounds complex.                                                                                          |
| 55:15      | It's got seven actions in it.                                                                            |
| 55:17      | And so I am 110% sure that everybody who uses this will be able to figure it out.                        |
| 55:26      | Because it's only seven actions.                                                                         |
| 55:28      | I will actually add an eight action for our listeners, which is a comment that says, you                 |
| 55:33      | need to open, you need to go back to shortcuts when you opens.                                           |
| 55:38      | But that's it.                                                                                           |
| 55:39      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 55:40      | I want to talk about a different area of capture that I think deserves special, you know, consideration. |
| 55:49      | And that's capturing communications, you know, there's an issue, a challenge I have, frankly,            |
| 55:56      | with capture, and that is other humans, right?                                                           |
| 55:59      | They email me, they text message me, they drop me notes in [[Slack]], and there's all these                  |
| 56:05      | places that you communicate with other humans that results in a lot of times action related              |
| 56:11      | capture, sometimes reference related, but usually action.                                                |
| 56:15      | And how do you reliably capture that and put it into your system with the minimum amount                 |
| 56:22      | of friction, but the 100% reliability?                                                                   |
| 56:27      | So maybe let's just take that by medium, and let's take the hardest one first in my opinion,             |
| 56:33      | and that is text messages.                                                                               |
| 56:35      | People always, and client, this is a particular problem for me with legal clients, because               |
| 56:39      | you know, legal stuff is serious.                                                                        |
| 56:41      | And when they ask me to do something via text message, I kind of want to have a record                   |
| 56:45      | of it.                                                                                                   |
| 56:46      | And I just want to get the details right if I ever have to act on it.                                    |
| 56:50      | So, and the Messages app doesn't really do a great job of that, you know, you can select                 |
| 56:59      | specific messages and share them, but you can't get like a group of like eight messages                  |
| 57:05      | together as a thread.                                                                                    |
| 57:07      | And I have tried all sorts of different solutions for this over the years, and I'll just tell            |
| 57:11      | you what I'm doing at this point.                                                                        |
| 57:13      | And it sounds really hacky, but I take screenshots.                                                      |
| 57:17      | I mean, just grab a screenshot when I have, you know, three or four messages with the                    |
| 57:22      | client, I'll save it.                                                                                    |
| 57:24      | And then I've got automation involved with save to file where it's putting it in a very                  |
| 57:28      | specific place on iCloud, and I can put links to it if I want in [[Obsidian]] and do other kinds             |
| 57:35      | of things with it.                                                                                       |
| 57:36      | But my ultimate solution for a quick capture of text messages is this screenshot.                        |
| 57:43      | What are you doing?                                                                                      |
| 57:44      | Uh, so I, I see your screenshot and I've raised you screenshot with PIXO and PIXO is an app              |
| 57:52      | for iOS, which will stitch screenshots together.                                                         |
| 57:56      | It can also do things like remove that scroll bar and stuff for you, which you don't necessarily         |
| 58:00      | want.                                                                                                    |
| 58:01      | Um, but the, the point of it is, is that then if I've got a longer thread, then I can make               |
| 58:08      | sure that I've got all of those in one screenshot, which really does help.                               |
| 58:12      | The other thing I do is if you tap and hold, uh, on messages in, well, messages, um, then                |
| 58:20      | if you use the more action, you can select multiple messages and I do this.                              |
| 58:24      | And then I use that share, uh, and then I share it, which opens it in a new message.                     |
| 58:29      | This drives me nuts, but it opens it in a new message.                                                   |
| 58:32      | And then I select all and I copy because this way I have the text from that image as well.               |
| 58:39      | Um, and I, I, I usually just paste this, um, uh, somewhere because this means if I'm looking             |
| 58:47      | for a word that I mentioned in that thread and it didn't make it into, um, into the title                |
| 58:52      | of this is almost certainly going to be a task or a project, um, or, um, or my, uh, my                   |
| 58:58      | notes, then I actually have the entire thread, you know, pasted right there.                             |
| 59:03      | Um, it's not formatted.                                                                                  |
| 59:04      | It's not pretty.                                                                                         |
| 59:05      | That's not how I read it.                                                                                |
| 59:06      | I go back to the image to read it, but it means that for searchability, I, I have it.                    |
| 59:11      | Um, and I have considered several times using one of the, the many great actions out there               |
| 59:17      | to OCR it, but at the end of the day, OCR can be a bit tricky.                                           |
| 59:22      | And when I have the ability to just copy and paste those items directly, it seems very                   |
| 59:27      | silly not to use it.                                                                                     |
| 59:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 59:29      | No, that makes total sense.                                                                              |
| 59:31      | The other piece I do with it is once I take the shot and I do stitch them together.                      |
| 59:36      | If it needed, I always hope I don't need to stitch them together because I, I don't want                 |
| 59:40      | to have that long.                                                                                       |
| 59:42      | I try to keep, uh, client communications out of messages to be honest, but the, um, when                 |
| 59:47      | I do, I'll, I'll stitch them together, but I also at the same time, well, depending on                   |
| 59:53      | context, I'll either put it straight into Army focus or I'll save a draft saying process,                |
| 59:59      | you know, text message through it and then, and then at the end of the day, when I go                    |
| 01:00:03   | through it, then I'll get the image in the right location and if I need to add Army focus                |
| 01:00:09   | tasks based on it or whatever, I'll take care of it all.                                                 |
| 01:00:12   | But that quick capture to me, and I'd love to hear from people in the audience if they've                |
| 01:00:17   | got a better solution, but everything I've tried feels very tenuous.                                     |
| 01:00:22   | Like trying to capture a specific text message is not easy and [[Apple]] just doesn't make it                |
| 01:00:29   | easy.                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:30   | I found that, you know, the screen grab is the easiest way I could do it.                                |
| 01:00:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:36   | Um, and, um, it's, it's one of those things where ideally, you know, you would just say                  |
| 01:00:40   | to people, you can't message me, um, but I, I found, uh, specifically at work, it's always               |
| 01:00:46   | managers using the chat system to ask for things that really need to be done as a change                 |
| 01:00:50   | request and stuff like that, um, and, and trying to tell your manager what to do unless                  |
| 01:00:54   | you have a great relationship with them might not go well.                                               |
| 01:00:57   | Um, so, uh, that, that's something that you, you need to keep an eye on.                                 |
| 01:01:01   | Um, but, um, the, the other thing is, is, you know, some people just can't be trained.                   |
| 01:01:06   | Um, you just have to deal with it and capture however.                                                   |
| 01:01:09   | Um, so that, that's what I'm doing with, with this.                                                      |
| 01:01:13   | Um, and you know, it's, it's not perfect, but it works.                                                  |
| 01:01:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:17   | The challenge of the text message is the immediacy of it.                                                |
| 01:01:20   | Um, it is the closest thing to immediate communications.                                                 |
| 01:01:24   | You can ignore a text, but you know, when it's the people that are paying for your shoes,                |
| 01:01:28   | it's hard to do that for a long time.                                                                    |
| 01:01:31   | A related, but easier problem for me are [[Slack]] and [[Slack]] like services.                                  |
| 01:01:37   | Um, and the reason that's easier for me is because check [[Slack]] is I do it once in the                    |
| 01:01:43   | morning and once in the evening.                                                                         |
| 01:01:45   | I don't keep it open all day.                                                                            |
| 01:01:47   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:48   | So it's not a thing that, you know, where tasks pass through.                                            |
| 01:01:51   | And so when I do the shutdown at the end of the day, I check communications, I check email,              |
| 01:01:56   | I check, I clear out text messages and I clear out [[Slack]].                                                |
| 01:01:59   | And, and if there's something in there, if Rose says, Hey, I need you to help me out                     |
| 01:02:03   | with this ad or, you know, we're going to plan the next episode of automators and [[Slack]].                 |
| 01:02:08   | Um, I can easily convert that to an action item because I'm sitting on my computer and                   |
| 01:02:13   | I can grab the text.                                                                                     |
| 01:02:14   | I can, there's a lot of ways I can automate it, but, but it's just the immediacy of those                |
| 01:02:19   | text messages that is my, the bane of my existence in terms of capture.                                  |
| 01:02:24   | How about email?                                                                                         |
| 01:02:25   | How are you dealing with email?                                                                          |
| 01:02:26   | Well, email is one of those things where, um, I like to avoid it, but I can't.                           |
| 01:02:32   | And so I, I have set up some things which make my life much easier.                                      |
| 01:02:37   | So for example, certain emails, I have auto format afforded to either Zapier or Integra                  |
| 01:02:42   | mat and I flip flop back and forth with these things as to which one works the best.                     |
| 01:02:46   | And it's just wherever I had a space to set up an action or scenario, uh, a Zapier scenario              |
| 01:02:52   | to be precise.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:53   | Um, and, um, basically I have it and then it will parse text out, um, and go, Oh, hey,                   |
| 01:03:00   | here's the magical information that I need to use.                                                       |
| 01:03:02   | And then it, uh, it will mark that email as read and archive it in almost all cases.                     |
| 01:03:09   | There are a few cases where it will just mark it as read and leave it in my inbox, but most              |
| 01:03:13   | of the time it's archived and so it's gone, um, which, uh, is great because the more emails              |
| 01:03:19   | that can be automatically handled for me, the better.                                                    |
| 01:03:22   | Um, and a lot of these things are stuff, um, like, for example, um, [[Amazon]] returns, whenever             |
| 01:03:28   | I'm returning something to [[Amazon]], um, I would like a mini OmniFocus project created                      |
| 01:03:33   | for that.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:34   | Thank you very much.                                                                                     |
| 01:03:35   | Um, and so what I do is I, I have, um, it look, um, for anything, uh, about your [[Amazon]]                  |
| 01:03:42   | return.                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:43   | And then this one is actually an [[Make\|Integromat]].                                                            |
| 01:03:45   | It branches out.                                                                                         |
| 01:03:46   | It checks whether or not it's something that I need to print a label for, uh, and if I                   |
| 01:03:49   | don't need to print a label, then it tells me, uh, then it, uh, gets, uh, uh, um, the,                   |
| 01:03:55   | the, the link from the thing for, for the barcode that the people at the, the store can                  |
| 01:04:00   | scan.                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:01   | Um, and then, um, it, it, you know, just create some Taskpaper and save that to a [[Dropbox]]               |
| 01:04:06   | folder.                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:07   | This is where things get a little bit sticky because that [[Dropbox]] folder has a [[Hazel]] rule                |
| 01:04:11   | on my Mac mini to move it to an iCloud folder.                                                           |
| 01:04:14   | Um, and this, uh, is inside of [[Drafts]] and then it goes into the, the [[Drafts]] inbox.                       |
| 01:04:20   | Um, and, um, then, uh, I see it and it's [[Taskpaper]] formatted and I know that means that                 |
| 01:04:25   | I press the button part parts Taskpaper, uh, in OmniFocus, uh, and, uh, then it just                     |
| 01:04:31   | magically goes into OmniFocus.                                                                            |
| 01:04:33   | I almost certainly could set this up to send this to a push cut action.                                  |
| 01:04:37   | Um, and then it would just, uh, and then that shortcut would go, Hey,                                    |
| 01:04:41   | Taskpaper, I'm saving this to OmniFocus done, um, but I, I like throwing things into [[Dropbox]]             |
| 01:04:46   | and so that's what I'm doing right now.                                                                  |
| 01:04:48   | Um, as it is, whichever way I do it, I'm going to be involving, um, you know, two applications.          |
| 01:04:54   | Um, so I, I figured I'd leave it with [[Dropbox]] [[Hazel]], um, for, for now.                                   |
| 01:04:59   | Um, but I can always change that.                                                                        |
| 01:05:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:02   | In my experience, anytime I automate moving files between two different clouds, there                    |
| 01:05:05   | be dragons.                                                                                              |
| 01:05:06   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:07   | Uh, I, uh, I mean, we, we, we done shows on email.                                                       |
| 01:05:11   | I don't really want to get into all of the automation of email, but just forget the capture              |
| 01:05:14   | purposes.                                                                                                |
| 01:05:15   | I'll tell you that like a lot of times an email will give me an action item and I can                    |
| 01:05:20   | select text and save that as an [[OmniFocus]] task.                                                           |
| 01:05:25   | There's a bunch of ways to do that using scripting.                                                      |
| 01:05:28   | Even like something on the Mac, like [[PopClip]], you can add it to [[OmniFocus]] very easily.                   |
| 01:05:32   | So there's, there's a million ways to grab text and turn it into a task directly.                        |
| 01:05:37   | I don't [[Drafts]] falls out of the loop when I'm turning emails into a capture item.                        |
| 01:05:43   | And then, you know, the bigger way to capture an email is to get a link to the email and                 |
| 01:05:49   | depends on which email platform use.                                                                     |
| 01:05:51   | If you use [[Apple Mail]], there is [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] you can use to grab the link.                              |
| 01:05:55   | If you use something like spark, spark generates its own specific spark link to the email.               |
| 01:06:00   | If you use, Hey, it's a URL.                                                                             |
| 01:06:03   | So it just depends on your email platform, but having a way to reliably capture a link                   |
| 01:06:08   | to the email that follows the email.                                                                     |
| 01:06:10   | So if you move the email to a different folder or whatever, you can still get it.                        |
| 01:06:14   | That is an excellent, excellent way to capture email.                                                    |
| 01:06:17   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:18   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:19   | And I find a judicious use of filters is great.                                                          |
| 01:06:22   | So I recently had a bit of a break from work and when I got back, I actually blocked off                 |
| 01:06:27   | the first three hours of my day so that nobody could drag me into meetings or anything.                  |
| 01:06:32   | And I didn't open the chat system or anything.                                                           |
| 01:06:35   | And I just sat there and I went through my inbox and I have my inbox open email on the                   |
| 01:06:40   | left side of my screen on the right side of my screen.                                                   |
| 01:06:42   | I had the web interface of my mail and I just sat there creating filters folders and just                |
| 01:06:47   | having stuff automatically filed away for me, which made it so much easier.                              |
| 01:06:52   | And so next time I take a break from work, I will hopefully not come back to quite as                    |
| 01:06:56   | full of an inbox.                                                                                        |
| 01:06:57   | In some ways, I'm breaking things up into secondary inboxes in another ways.                             |
| 01:07:03   | I'm just getting rid of things pretty much so that they're there if I need them for reference,           |
| 01:07:07   | but I probably won't.                                                                                    |
| 01:07:10   | This episode of the automators is brought to you by delete me.                                           |
| 01:07:13   | Remove your personal info from data brokers and get 30% off with the code automators.                    |
| 01:07:20   | Have you ever Googled yourself?                                                                          |
| 01:07:22   | It can be kind of wild to see what private information is available for others to see.                   |
| 01:07:27   | There's an entire world of shady companies out there that collect and sell your personal                 |
| 01:07:31   | information.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:33   | They're called data brokers and they know your phone number, home address, political                     |
| 01:07:37   | affiliations and dating preferences.                                                                     |
| 01:07:41   | Even if you've been careful, you've left a massive fingerprint on the internet and                       |
| 01:07:45   | an average data broker can possess about 1500 data points about each person.                             |
| 01:07:51   | And it's the kind of data that can be used for cyber stalking, doxing or identity theft.                 |
| 01:07:56   | The good news is you can take one simple step to remove yourself from the majority of these              |
| 01:08:00   | data brokers.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:02   | You can use delete me.                                                                                   |
| 01:08:03   | Think of delete me as an anti data broker.                                                               |
| 01:08:07   | They've removed millions and millions of records from data brokers over the last 12 years and            |
| 01:08:11   | continue to fight for users' right to privacy.                                                           |
| 01:08:15   | The world with the internet is inherently less private, but that doesn't mean you have                   |
| 01:08:19   | to just give up on it.                                                                                   |
| 01:08:21   | With delete me, you can fight back and try to keep some of your most valuable data off                   |
| 01:08:25   | the internet.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:26   | So someone doesn't steal your identity or dox you protecting your privacy is important.                  |

| 01:09:00   | So David, we have another question for ask the automators, which of course you're welcome                |
| 01:09:04   | to send to us.                                                                                           |
| 01:09:05   | There's a link on the relay FN page.                                                                     |
| 01:09:07   | And also you can just post in the forums or tweet at us.                                                 |
| 01:09:11   | But today's question is from John, which said, Hi, I've just started automating my Mac using             |
| 01:09:16   | automators.                                                                                              |
| 01:09:17   | How good is it?                                                                                          |
| 01:09:18   | And it's really nice.                                                                                    |
| 01:09:19   | I'd say it's pretty good.                                                                                |
| 01:09:20   | It's a good place to start.                                                                              |
| 01:09:22   | And John says, I have now begun some email automations because I regularly send the same                 |
| 01:09:27   | email to a number of staff and other contexts.                                                           |
| 01:09:29   | It's currently triggered by a calendar event and then runs mail and a pre formulated email.              |
| 01:09:33   | I think that works fine.                                                                                 |
| 01:09:34   | Well, John, I'm really, really glad to hear that that is working great for you because                   |
| 01:09:38   | the calendar trigger is one of the best ways of triggering an automator automation in my                 |
| 01:09:42   | opinion.                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:44   | John continues.                                                                                          |
| 01:09:45   | I am wondering if anyone knows a way to get automator to find an email for a particular                  |
| 01:09:48   | contact so that then I can open the most recent email from that contact as a reference for               |
| 01:09:54   | the email I am sending in case I need to add more personalised content to it.                            |
| 01:09:59   | And David, this is one that's had you and me scratching your heads a little bit because                  |
| 01:10:03   | automators pretty good, but I don't necessarily think it's the right tool for this particular            |
| 01:10:11   | problem.                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:12   | And let's go to his first question.                                                                      |
| 01:10:15   | How good is automator?                                                                                   |
| 01:10:17   | It's good at what it does, but as a very limited tool set, I think the underlying problem                |
| 01:10:22   | is the inability to really address variables, like if you're sending an email through automator,         |
| 01:10:29   | you can't have it fill in the name of the recipient at the time.                                         |
| 01:10:32   | It has to be a set person for that automation, something that shortcuts kind of fixed.                   |
| 01:10:39   | If only they had given Saul the resources and the love that gave workflows slash shortcuts.              |
| 01:10:48   | The problems he's hitting are problems are not going to be solvable with automator because               |
| 01:10:53   | of those limitations, but I suspect you have some ideas.                                                 |
| 01:10:57   | Well I do have some ideas.                                                                               |
| 01:10:58   | So the great thing about mail is whenever you hover over a contact, so I've got an email                 |
| 01:11:04   | to David Sparks here, and this is an email that I am in the process of writing.                          |
| 01:11:08   | So this is just like something that would have been opened by automator.                                 |
| 01:11:11   | There's a little downer by David Sparks, and then right at the bottom of that, there is                  |
| 01:11:15   | search for David Sparks.                                                                                 |
| 01:11:17   | And this pops open the mail window behind the currently editing email window, and it's                   |
| 01:11:22   | searching for all email from you.                                                                        |
| 01:11:26   | Now this isn't automated, which is unfortunate, but it does mean that every time you're processing       |
| 01:11:32   | an email, you do that, and then you know that the mail window has got that, you know, for                |
| 01:11:38   | the right person.                                                                                        |
| 01:11:39   | Now I am 100% certain that with the right Google Foo, you could find an AppleScript                     |
| 01:11:45   | that will do this for you, and assign it to say, and either you could use [[FastScripts]],                  |
| 01:11:50   | they've sponsored the show before, they would be a great way to do this, to assign a keyboard            |
| 01:11:53   | shortcut to it, or you could, you know, paste it into an automated direction as well for                 |
| 01:12:00   | that.                                                                                                    |
| 01:12:01   | But I think the problem that you're going to find then is that for every email that you've               |
| 01:12:05   | got open, you've also got a mail window, and those are not necessarily going to match up,                |
| 01:12:10   | because windows sometimes, they just move in funny ways.                                                 |
| 01:12:13   | So if you're going through processing, say, 10 emails, and it starts with David Sparks,                  |
| 01:12:17   | and so you've got David Sparks on both sides, and you look at that, okay, so you close that              |
| 01:12:21   | window, but then you've forgotten to close the mail window on the right, and then you're                 |
| 01:12:24   | working on an email to [[Stephen Hackett]], ooh, that's something that might go wrong.                       |
| 01:12:28   | And so I think this is probably good, actually, in this case, manual is going to be the best             |
| 01:12:33   | way of doing that.                                                                                       |
| 01:12:35   | But you know, one of our listeners might have a suggestion, and this is actually a post                  |
| 01:12:40   | in the forums.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:41   | So I'm going to put a link to that in the show notes.                                                    |
| 01:12:43   | So if anybody has a good solution for John, then I would also love to hear that.                         |
| 01:12:49   | But I did feel that it fitted the topic today, because we did end up in email quite well.                |
| 01:12:55   | Another option for John, this is a much, you know, hacky, sparky solution.                               |
| 01:12:59   | If you've got an iPhone or an iPad, you could easily create a shortcut that would prompt                 |
| 01:13:05   | you to search for emails by a specific name, or you could do this in Apple Mail.                         |
| 01:13:10   | But with shortcuts, you could make a choose from list shortcut, like if this is a group                  |
| 01:13:14   | of employees or coworkers, and let's say it's a group of 10 people, you're always going                  |
| 01:13:18   | to the same 10.                                                                                          |
| 01:13:19   | You could have a choose from menu shortcut, where you pick the name, and it goes and searches            |
| 01:13:24   | for all the recent email that is from that name, because you have the variables in shortcuts             |
| 01:13:31   | that you don't have in Automator.                                                                        |
| 01:13:33   | And like if you had an iPad sitting next to your computer, you could just run the shortcut               |
| 01:13:38   | and have it as a reference off your iPad screen.                                                         |
| 01:13:40   | I realised that there's a lot of problems with that, you know, you're not getting the                    |
| 01:13:44   | text on the same system, although you could move that over with some of the ways we talked               |
| 01:13:49   | about today.                                                                                             |
| 01:13:50   | But, you know, that would be also a quick way.                                                           |
| 01:13:52   | If you're just checking for reference on a person, you could put a shortcut together                     |
| 01:13:56   | that somewhat automates that.                                                                            |
| 01:13:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:14:00   | The only thing I'll say here is usually our default Mac recommendation for automating                    |
| 01:14:05   | stuff would be [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                         |
| 01:14:07   | However, in this particular case, [[Keyboard Maestro]] can't do this.                                        |
| 01:14:11   | And [[Keyboard Maestro]] doesn't have as many options available to it as Automator does.                     |
| 01:14:16   | It's only got two macros or two actions, whereas Automator has several.                                  |
| 01:14:23   | So if you need to upgrade from Automator, you are going to be looking at AppleScript                     |
| 01:14:27   | pretty much, and that is going to be, you know, your process.                                            |
| 01:14:33   | Now you could probably use [[Keyboard Maestro\|Keyboard Maestro's]] click-it image to find the drop-down arrow                 |
| 01:14:42   | next to the person in the to field and click that, and then click search for person.                     |
| 01:14:51   | But I think that's going to be a pretty hacky way of doing it.                                           |
| 01:14:54   | So I would recommend sticking to it manually unless you can find an AppleScript that solves              |
| 01:14:57   | the problem.                                                                                             |
| 01:14:58   | I'll put a link in the show notes.                                                                       |
| 01:14:59   | I made an AppleScript for Apple Mail that grabs the name of the person in the to field                   |
| 01:15:05   | and then creates the salutation.                                                                         |
| 01:15:07   | But you don't need the second part, but if you're doing a search, grabbing the name from                 |
| 01:15:11   | the to field could be helpful.                                                                           |
| 01:15:13   | So feel free to hack at that.                                                                            |
| 01:15:15   | Actually grabbing the email from the to field might help because the search that it's doing              |
| 01:15:20   | specifically, if you were to type it, it would be from colon email.                                      |
| 01:15:27   | And then when you press return, then it does some magic to change that into like a little                |
| 01:15:34   | tag thing where you can change from to to or entire message.                                             |
| 01:15:38   | And if I double click it, then it is actually showing me the name, but that's because you're             |
| 01:15:44   | in my contacts, though I would hope if you're sending people email, then they're in your                 |
| 01:15:48   | contacts.                                                                                                |
| 01:15:49   | Yeah, Apple Mail, it's so often there's so many things about it to like as an automator                  |
| 01:15:55   | that it's addressable by AppleScript, but it's so wonky.                                                 |
| 01:15:59   | I mean, just like I was writing an AppleScript where I wanted to get the to field and I needed           |
| 01:16:05   | to make it plural.                                                                                       |
| 01:16:06   | I mean, it's just like weird, weird stuff, like whoever was like making the AppleScript                  |
| 01:16:12   | commands that day had a bad day or maybe it was drinking, I'm not sure what happened                     |
| 01:16:17   | there because nothing is consistent, but you've really got to kind of dig into the code to               |
| 01:16:22   | figure that out.                                                                                         |
| 01:16:24   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:25   | Well, David, I think it's time to talk about some problems that we've been solving recently              |
| 01:16:28   | because I don't know if you've looked in the relay slack recently and the messages that                  |
| 01:16:32   | we've got between each other.                                                                            |
| 01:16:34   | But in case you hadn't noticed, there's a third person in our one-to-one message.                        |
| 01:16:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:16:39   | Who's this [[Make\|Integromat]], that keeps messaging me, Rose?                                              |
| 01:16:42   | Well, it's messaging me too.                                                                             |
| 01:16:44   | So one of the things that I wanted to solve is whenever I have an idea for an automator                  |
| 01:16:49   | show, I feel like I should be sharing that with you, but I should be sharing that with                   |
| 01:16:55   | you in an appropriate manner, which means that I should share it through [[Slack]].                          |
| 01:16:59   | Obviously, I could message you or I could email you about it, but I figured [[Slack]] is                     |
| 01:17:03   | a good place for realy.fm business because we have a realy.fm [[Slack]].                                     |
| 01:17:08   | And unfortunately, [[Slack]] on iOS is not super-automatable, but we have an air table for all of our show   |
| 01:17:17   | planning, basically.                                                                                     |
| 01:17:18   | And we have tables for guests, we have tables for shows, we have host overviews, we've got               |
| 01:17:23   | episodes and stuff like that.                                                                            |
| 01:17:25   | We've even got some accounting things in there.                                                          |
| 01:17:27   | But the primary table that we use is show planning.                                                      |
| 01:17:30   | And there's a couple of fields that I wanted to make sure were filled out every time I                   |
| 01:17:36   | posted this, which is, number one, I wanted the status to be set to for space idea because               |
| 01:17:41   | a single select, I find the best way to make sure that the order of this stays consistent                |
| 01:17:47   | so that everything is where you would hope it to be is to actually prepend this with                     |
| 01:17:53   | numbers.                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:54   | So we've got planning, scheduled, recorded idea, and then released as right at the bottom                |
| 01:18:03   | because most of the time we don't need to necessarily look at release there.                             |
| 01:18:08   | And so I wanted to make sure that the title and the status were set correctly.                           |
| 01:18:15   | And I also wanted to be able to add notes.                                                               |
| 01:18:17   | And then I wanted to be able to ping you and go, hey, there's a new idea.                                |
| 01:18:20   | And of course, you'll be able to use this as well.                                                       |
| 01:18:22   | I've just been trialling out and set it up.                                                              |
| 01:18:24   | But what I did was I can put things in air table with shortcuts using the get contents                   |
| 01:18:29   | of URL, but that means that I'm putting it in air table and that is using my API key                     |
| 01:18:38   | and everything else.                                                                                     |
| 01:18:39   | And then I still have to fire something off to ping you through [[Slack]].                                   |
| 01:18:43   | Now [[Slack]] does have an API and you can get API keys for it depending on how people have                  |
| 01:18:47   | set up the bases.                                                                                        |
| 01:18:48   | But [[Make\|Integromat]] has API integration, a [[Slack]] API, and so it can talk to [[Slack]] for you,                    |
| 01:18:55   | which means I didn't have to figure out any of that.                                                     |
| 01:18:57   | So I created a three step scenario in [[Make\|Integromat]].                                                        |
| 01:19:02   | First of all, it's got a web hook.                                                                       |
| 01:19:03   | So I ping the web hook and I send it the idea and a note.                                                |
| 01:19:08   | The note could be empty.                                                                                 |
| 01:19:09   | That's fine.                                                                                             |
| 01:19:10   | And then it takes that, it creates an air table record using the idea, the note, and                     |
| 01:19:17   | it puts in for space idea in the status every single time.                                               |
| 01:19:21   | And then it posts in our [[Slack]] to say, hey, there is a new show idea.                                    |
| 01:19:27   | And then it just puts the name of the idea.                                                              |
| 01:19:29   | Now I would like to add a link to our air table view so that you can easily see that.                    |
| 01:19:36   | But I'll figure that out at some point.                                                                  |
| 01:19:39   | But I just thought that that would be a pretty cool way of making sure that things always                |
| 01:19:43   | end up in there in a nice way so that you know about it.                                                 |
| 01:19:48   | And yeah, it seemed like a fun exercise in automation, at the very least.                                |
| 01:19:54   | It feels like [[Make\|Integromat]] just continues to get traction with cloud automation.                           |
| 01:19:58   | Well, what I like about it is it does work really well for me.                                           |
| 01:20:03   | So it might not work really well for everyone, but I love that visual element to it.                     |
| 01:20:09   | Where if you've got a split, then you can see it split, and you don't necessarily see                    |
| 01:20:14   | a lot of detail about each step until you click into it, but then you have everything.                   |
| 01:20:21   | And in some ways, it's more powerful than Zapier.                                                        |
| 01:20:22   | In other ways, Zapier is more powerful than [[Make\|Integromat]].                                                  |
| 01:20:26   | So I feel like everybody should have a look at both if they're looking for an online web                 |
| 01:20:31   | automation service.                                                                                      |
| 01:20:32   | It is cheaper, which has a lot in its favor.                                                             |
| 01:20:34   | Yeah, it really is interesting because we did a show on cloud-based automation status                    |
| 01:20:41   | like about four months ago, and what we said then is still true.                                         |
| 01:20:45   | All of these players have got different areas of focus.                                                  |
| 01:20:49   | I have TTT, Zapier, [[Make\|Integromat]], and I guess if you want to try this out, you just got                    |
| 01:20:54   | to really take a look at each tool and see what problems you're trying to solve.                         |
| 01:20:59   | But I still wouldn't recommend making them to [[Rube Goldberg]] because you're adding the                    |
| 01:21:05   | internet to the mix on every step for these solutions.                                                   |
| 01:21:09   | And it could be no fault of [[Make\|Integromat]], but something may not work because the service                   |
| 01:21:15   | you're connecting to is having issues, and then you get frustrated.                                      |
| 01:21:20   | Yeah, yeah, and that's the thing.                                                                        |
| 01:21:22   | You have to figure out where the balance lies for you.                                                   |
| 01:21:26   | And for me, I decided that in this particular case, what I like about this is I can trigger              |
| 01:21:30   | it from a shortcut, I can trigger it from [[Drafts]], I can trigger it from [[Airmail]] through                  |
| 01:21:36   | shortcuts, and all sorts of things.                                                                      |
| 01:21:40   | So I've got it set up so that then I don't have to create hundreds of almost identical                   |
| 01:21:46   | automations on my side, and it means that if we ever change something and add an extra                   |
| 01:21:50   | status or remove a status, then I can easily renumber that step, and I do that once, and                 |
| 01:21:57   | then all of the automations have been updated, which works really nicely.                                |
| 01:22:00   | Well, I'll tell you what I've been having fun automating lately is the word [[Obsidian]]                     |
| 01:22:06   | had come up way too many times in today's show.                                                          |
| 01:22:09   | But as I continue to dig in with it as my PKM solution, the addition of their end-to-end                 |
| 01:22:16   | encryption made it possible for me to use the app the way I wanted to use it.                            |
| 01:22:21   | But it's an electron app, and as we record, it's on the Mac only, but their mobile apps                  |
| 01:22:27   | are very, very shortly coming.                                                                           |
| 01:22:29   | But wanting to automate an electron app has got its own unique set of challenges.                        |
| 01:22:35   | A lot of the stuff I would typically do in [[Keyboard Maestro]] doesn't work with an electron                |
| 01:22:38   | app.                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:40   | Even stuff like dictation tools often break with electron apps.                                          |
| 01:22:45   | So I've had a good time and a challenge, kind of figuring out what I can and cannot automate             |
| 01:22:51   | with it.                                                                                                 |
| 01:22:52   | Built into the app, it has its own templating system with date strings and title strings.                |
| 01:22:58   | So you can actually do quite a bit of automation right with the built-in tools, which is cool.           |
| 01:23:03   | I appreciate the developer spending the time to do that, and it allows for third-party                   |
| 01:23:07   | plugins and some of those create even more automation tools.                                             |
| 01:23:12   | But when it comes to third-party plugins and an electron app, I feel like each one you                   |
| 01:23:17   | add is exponentially adding a problem as you start stacking third-party additions onto                   |
| 01:23:25   | this electron app.                                                                                       |
| 01:23:26   | At some point, you're going to break it, just a question of time.                                        |
| 01:23:30   | One of the things I've been doing, which is just really Automators 101, but it has a very                |
| 01:23:35   | robust keyboard shortcut system.                                                                         |
| 01:23:38   | And since this is at this point at least a Mac-only app, I have mapped out an entire                     |
| 01:23:43   | panel of [[Stream Deck]] to this app.                                                                        |
| 01:23:48   | So when I load this app, you can have it, [[Stream Deck]] has an option to automatically load a              |
| 01:23:52   | panel based on which app you're running.                                                                 |
| 01:23:55   | A lot of the more obscure keyboard shortcut stuff that I don't seem to be able to remember,              |
| 01:24:00   | I've just added buttons to my [[Stream Deck]] for it.                                                        |
| 01:24:03   | Another way that I found it very easy to work with this is doing text replacement stuff,                 |
| 01:24:09   | like TextExpander or whatnot.                                                                           |
| 01:24:11   | And also, as I talked about during the show today, creating custom actions and [[Drafts]] where              |
| 01:24:17   | I can assemble text and [[Drafts]] to put into the app.                                                      |
| 01:24:21   | And I've actually found that I'm doing a pretty good job of getting this app in shape for an             |
| 01:24:26   | Automator and getting more out of it and not having to spend a bunch of time typing.                     |
| 01:24:33   | When I have a new client matter, for instance, it lays everything out.                                   |
| 01:24:36   | I need just how I need it.                                                                               |
| 01:24:37   | I don't have to type that ever again.                                                                    |
| 01:24:40   | And it's more accurate because it's automatically entered.                                               |
| 01:24:43   | And like anybody who listens to the show, it gives me a little bit of pleasure when I can                |
| 01:24:49   | take an app and kind of take the reins of it using automation tools.                                     |
| 01:24:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:54   | I really like that.                                                                                      |
| 01:24:55   | And I'm glad you mentioned that you can automatically change which [[Stream Deck]] profile for the app       |
| 01:25:00   | that you're in, because I find sometimes this is exactly what I need, and sometimes this                 |
| 01:25:06   | is not what I need.                                                                                      |
| 01:25:07   | So I've actually dedicated the bottom right-hand corner of my [[Stream Deck]] on every single profile        |
| 01:25:14   | pretty much to a return to my default profile button, because you can change profiles.                   |
| 01:25:22   | Which means that when I open OmniFocus, I get my OmniFocus profile and things like that,                 |
| 01:25:28   | which really helps.                                                                                      |
| 01:25:30   | But then if I need my regular one, because say I'm in OmniFocus, but now I'm going to                    |
| 01:25:34   | record automators, so I need my podcasting profile, then I can just bounce back to my                    |
| 01:25:39   | default one.                                                                                             |
| 01:25:40   | And then from there, it's essentially an index of my [[Stream Deck]] profile.                                |
| 01:25:45   | So I can easily go back to whatever it is I need to do.                                                  |
| 01:25:48   | So then it's two buttons to get me into podcasting mode.                                                 |
| 01:25:52   | And that's great.                                                                                        |
| 01:25:53   | Bottom left corner or bottom right corner?                                                               |
| 01:25:56   | Ah, I was just saying, we're on the same page, because I'm on the bottom left corner.                    |
| 01:26:00   | And I have three buttons there, Mr. Context.                                                             |
| 01:26:02   | I should probably change it, because the bottom left is the most inaccessible one, so I'm                |
| 01:26:06   | less likely to press that accidentally.                                                                  |
| 01:26:10   | But I'll have to see.                                                                                    |
| 01:26:11   | I'm also loving the fact that [[Stream Deck]] has got so many integrations and apps.                         |
| 01:26:15   | I recently installed Ecamm Live for iOS today, so I can share my screen.                                 |
| 01:26:20   | And I love the fact that there are actions for this, so I have my different profiles,                    |
| 01:26:25   | so I can share iPad versus iPhone versus me.                                                             |
| 01:26:29   | I like the [[Stream Deck]] so much.                                                                          |
| 01:26:31   | I know that it's an expense, and there are apps out there where you can turn an iPad                     |
| 01:26:36   | screen into some of these features.                                                                      |
| 01:26:38   | But there's just something to be said to have a panel of physical buttons next to your Mac,              |
| 01:26:43   | like a little control panel.                                                                             |
| 01:26:45   | And like you, Mr. Contextual Computing, I have three buttons.                                            |
| 01:26:49   | And one is the personal space, one is the MacSparky space, and one is the legal space.                  |
| 01:26:54   | So even though I have it jumping to app panels for most of the big apps I work in, like another          |
| 01:27:01   | one that this is great for is Microsoft Word, because there's a whole bunch of weird stuff               |
| 01:27:05   | you can do with Word, like sharing [[Drafts]] as PDF, and things that require a lot of clicks                |
| 01:27:10   | to get to, and they don't even have shortcuts.                                                           |
| 01:27:12   | I've been able to map using [[Keyboard Maestro]] and choose from menu item in [[Keyboard Maestro]].              |
| 01:27:20   | That's like a very simple command in [[Keyboard Maestro]], but you can go many layers deep                   |
| 01:27:24   | in submenus and get features added to a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script.                                         |
| 01:27:29   | And then there is a third-party plugin for the [[Stream Deck]] called KMLink.                                |
| 01:27:35   | I want to say TJ turned me on to this, but I'm not sure who turned me on to it.                          |
| 01:27:40   | But the thing I like about that over the native [[Keyboard Maestro]] integration is that once                |
| 01:27:45   | you put a KMLink script on your [[Stream Deck]], you can move it around.                                     |
| 01:27:51   | You can drag it to different places on the [[Stream Deck]] and the [[Stream Deck]] app and not                   |
| 01:27:57   | have to remap it, because with the built-in one, you have to map it to a particular button.              |
| 01:28:01   | And I find that really useful to kind of get the layout the way I want.                                  |
| 01:28:06   | But either way, anytime I want, those three buttons are at the bottom of literally every                 |
| 01:28:10   | screen on my [[Stream Deck]].                                                                                |
| 01:28:13   | So I think the [[Stream Deck]] is the new drinking game for automators.                                      |
| 01:28:17   | Well, let's see how frequently it comes up, David.                                                       |
| 01:28:21   | I'm thinking more of a dark chocolate game myself.                                                       |
| 01:28:23   | An excuse for dark chocolate, right?                                                                     |
| 01:28:26   | Honestly, I'm right with you, sister.                                                                    |
| 01:28:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:28:30   | I mean, I recently got some dark chocolate KitKats, so I need to automate adding those                   |
| 01:28:34   | to my shopping list.                                                                                     |
| 01:28:36   | I'm considering when I open the cupboard that contains the chocolate, just NFC stickers                  |
| 01:28:42   | on a piece of paper behind which, that'll be behind another piece of paper which has                     |
| 01:28:47   | logos of different chocolate bars on so I can just tap it and it automatically adds                      |
| 01:28:50   | those once to my shopping list whenever I start running out.                                             |
| 01:28:52   | I can just tap it.                                                                                       |
| 01:28:53   | I was thinking you'd be like a fancy Toblerone person.                                                  |
| 01:28:57   | That's what I'm thinking.                                                                                |
| 01:28:58   | I mean, I like Toblerone.                                                                               |
| 01:28:59   | Don't get me wrong.                                                                                      |
| 01:29:00   | But I mean, sometimes you just like a dark chocolate KitKat just hits the spot or maybe                  |
| 01:29:05   | a twirl very occasionally in Mars Bar.                                                                   |
| 01:29:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:09   | Anyway.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:10   | All right.                                                                                               |
| 01:29:11   | A lot of times in the US, there's a company called Dove and they make these dark chocolate               |
| 01:29:16   | like they'll have, you know, Christmas.                                                                  |
| 01:29:21   | Sorry.                                                                                                   |
| 01:29:22   | What?                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:23   | I'm laughing, David, because American chocolate for one and secondly, over here, Dove is a               |
| 01:29:27   | company that makes soap.                                                                                 |
| 01:29:28   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:29   | I know.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:30   | I know.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:31   | I know.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:32   | But they make good ones here and I know every time I bring up the topic of chocolate, you                |
| 01:29:36   | just put up with me barely.                                                                              |
| 01:29:39   | But they make little like ones that like Thanksgiving and Christmas and, you know, Valentine's Day       |
| 01:29:46   | anyway.                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:47   | The other day I was in the closet where we keep pots and pans, you know, like the utility                |
| 01:29:52   | closet and I found that my wife has a secret stash of dark chocolate in there and she doesn't            |
| 01:29:58   | think I know about it.                                                                                   |
| 01:29:59   | So I'm taking them, but I'm only taking them at a level that I feel like she won't realise               |
| 01:30:06   | that, you know, it's disappearing a little faster than she thought.                                      |
| 01:30:10   | Okay, David, can I just say right now for the sake of your marriage, [[Amazon]] subscribe                    |
| 01:30:14   | and save.                                                                                                |
| 01:30:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:30:16   | I guess.                                                                                                 |
| 01:30:17   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:30:18   | That is an automation that might prevent you from being murdered.                                        |
| 01:30:21   | Maybe I should give my own secret stash and put it somewhere, but I can't keep any secrets               |
| 01:30:27   | from that lady.                                                                                          |
| 01:30:28   | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 01:30:29   | She would find my secret stash no matter where I put it.                                                 |
| 01:30:32   | I'm not suggesting that you don't tell her about your secret stash.                                      |
| 01:30:35   | I'm just suggesting that you make sure that that's replenished because if she wants chocolate            |
| 01:30:41   | and you've eaten it, we've got a dead David Sparks and I need to find a new co-host.                     |
| 01:30:45   | Let's just give you work.                                                                                |
| 01:30:47   | Well, anyway, maybe that's a future automation, how to automatically hide your chocolate.                |
| 01:30:53   | Either way, gang, we are the automators.                                                                 |

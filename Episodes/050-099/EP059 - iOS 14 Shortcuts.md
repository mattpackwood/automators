| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Our Tomatoes, where we do our best to make our technology do all                   |
| 00:06      | of the hard stuff for us.                                                                                |
| 00:07      | My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                   |
| 00:10      | Hey David.                                                                                               |
| 00:11      | Hey Rosemary, happy iOS 14 release.                                                                      |
| 00:15      | Oh yes, yes, all of the bugs, because you know, he doesn't love shipping a couple of                     |
| 00:21      | those into production as well.                                                                           |
| 00:22      | Yeah, it was kind of crazy because they said, oh, and it's coming out tomorrow, and all                  |
| 00:27      | our friends in the development and tech community just went, what?                                       |
| 00:31      | Well, also all of the people who are supposed to write about this stuff, produce videos                  |
| 00:36      | on it.                                                                                                   |
| 00:37      | Everybody's just there like, okay, thanks.                                                               |
| 00:42      | And so, you know, [[Federico Viticci]], at [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), just tweeted like, my review is not going               |
| 00:47      | to be ready by tomorrow people, and you know, that's a good thing because people should                  |
| 00:51      | not kill themselves trying to get stuff out the door.                                                    |
| 00:54      | I know some of the developers we've had on the show have been, you know, tweeting, you                   |
| 00:57      | know, like, their stuff is coming, but it's not ready yet.                                               |
| 01:00      | And some other developers, you know, have had, you know, the time and had enough time                    |
| 01:03      | for testing that they were able to get features out the door already, but nobody's better                |
| 01:08      | than anybody else because of that.                                                                       |
| 01:10      | Yeah, I did, however, get my update out.                                                                 |
| 01:13      | So if you are a shortcuts field guide customer, just go in, log into your shortcuts field                |
| 01:18      | guide and there's, I think it's like 45 minutes or so of new videos in there with all the                |
| 01:23      | new stuff for shortcuts with iOS 14.                                                                     |
| 01:26      | If you are not a shortcuts field guide customer, it's currently $5 off, so check that out.               |
| 01:31      | And I'm doing a webinar on October 1st, which I think is just a couple of days after the                 |
| 01:37      | show airs.                                                                                               |
| 01:38      | So go sign up for that, we'll put it in the show notes.                                                  |
| 01:41      | It's going to be all about, we're going to, you know, we're just hitting all the hammers.                |
| 01:45      | So enough of me talking about stuff I'm doing.                                                           |
| 01:49      | Today we're here to talk about iOS 14 and shortcuts.                                                     |
| 01:53      | I thought we'd start kind of with the quality of the life stuff and work our way down to                 |
| 01:57      | the nerdy stuff as we get through the show.                                                              |
| 02:00      | And to begin with, let's just take a little bit of a look at the interface changes.                      |
| 02:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 02:06      | So there's a lot of things like they tweak the colours again, which is nice.                              |
| 02:10      | They're a bit brighter.                                                                                  |
| 02:11      | I find the contrast is a little bit better.                                                              |
| 02:13      | So hopefully, you know, that is the same for everybody else.                                             |
| 02:17      | And they've done things like they've changed the default icon for shortcuts.                             |
| 02:20      | It's no longer the one with the sparks, it is an outline of the shortcuts icon, which                    |
| 02:25      | I like, you know, it's a very small thing, but it makes a difference for me.                             |
| 02:31      | It looks a bit more polished.                                                                            |
| 02:33      | I do wish though they would settle on the colours.                                                        |
| 02:35      | It's like, come on, man, just, just make a choice.                                                       |
| 02:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 02:39      | It's like every time you're taking screenshots, it's like all new screenshots again.                     |
| 02:42      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                           |
| 02:43      | As someone who writes in publishers about this stuff, I really would like them to just                   |
| 02:47      | choose, choose a set of colours and be there with it.                                                     |
| 02:50      | The also, I think that, you know, just navigation got easier definitely on iPad now that it              |
| 02:55      | has the sidebar.                                                                                         |
| 02:56      | It's one of the early apps to adopt the sidebar.                                                         |
| 03:00      | And we're going to talk about folders in just a minute, but the sidebar doesn't just show                |
| 03:03      | you your folders.                                                                                        |
| 03:04      | It also has some smart groups.                                                                           |
| 03:07      | The ability to automatically group the sharing button shortcuts, I think is really, that's               |
| 03:13      | one of the most useful features to me throughout the beta.                                               |
| 03:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 03:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 03:18      | You've always had the ability to turn shortcuts into sharing button shortcuts where you hit              |
| 03:23      | the sharing button and allow you to do things.                                                           |
| 03:26      | And we've talked about some of those on the show in the past, we'll probably have a couple               |
| 03:28      | of them today.                                                                                           |
| 03:30      | But figuring out which apps are in that sharing button, which aren't, was always difficult.              |
| 03:35      | And if you've got, you know, like Rose and me, I mean, my library is like 400, yours                     |
| 03:40      | is probably what, 7, 800 at this point?                                                                  |
| 03:42      | How many shortcuts you have?                                                                             |
| 03:43      | 954.                                                                                                     |
| 03:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 03:45      | There you go.                                                                                            |
| 03:46      | You know, going through and checking manually to see which ones are sharing icon shortcuts               |
| 03:51      | is not really ideal.                                                                                     |
| 03:53      | So they made some smart groups and they, they did that for the watch too.                                |
| 03:57      | And I feel like that was a big quality of life improvement for people who actually want                  |
| 04:01      | to use shortcuts.                                                                                        |
| 04:02      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 04:03      | Especially.                                                                                              |
| 04:04      | So if you go into any of these smart folders, so say for example, the Apple watch and then               |
| 04:08      | you tap on the select, then you can use select all in the top left and you can remove all                |
| 04:13      | of them from your Apple watch if you have like 954 shortcuts attempting to sync to your                  |
| 04:18      | Apple watch to start with.                                                                               |
| 04:20      | And you're there going like, why are these not syncing?                                                  |
| 04:22      | Well, it's possibly because you have too many.                                                           |
| 04:24      | So I literally just took all of mine off of my watch and have gone through and manually                  |
| 04:28      | put a couple back on that I wanted to sync over to my watch, which is great.                             |
| 04:32      | That was like a beta life problem when they first released it.                                           |
| 04:35      | They literally put all of your shortcuts on the watch.                                                   |
| 04:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 04:39      | And when I saw that, I realised this is crazy and I'm not going to go through and manually               |
| 04:43      | remove them all.                                                                                         |
| 04:44      | So I just sat tight on it.                                                                               |
| 04:46      | And at some point through the beta process, they removed them all and they added a couple.               |
| 04:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 04:53      | Did you play it all?                                                                                     |
| 04:54      | Yeah, that is good.                                                                                      |
| 04:55      | There's an interesting shortcut they added.                                                              |
| 04:56      | It's like a music quiz game for your watch.                                                              |
| 04:59      | Have you looked at that?                                                                                 |
| 05:00      | No, no, I haven't, but there are these starter shortcuts and I've not really tried them much,            |
| 05:10      | but it looks fun, I have to say.                                                                         |
| 05:12      | I've just not actually run it.                                                                           |
| 05:14      | I was looking at the shortcut itself from a technical perspective instead of playing                     |
| 05:17      | with it.                                                                                                 |
| 05:18      | Yeah, me too.                                                                                            |
| 05:19      | And it looks kind of like anything we'd make here on automators.                                         |
| 05:23      | There's no special fairy dust magic to it.                                                               |
| 05:25      | They don't have private actions.                                                                         |
| 05:27      | They have private APIs and it's built inside.                                                            |
| 05:30      | So it's fun, but I mean, I'm not going to use it.                                                        |
| 05:34      | I don't feel a burning desire to play a music quiz game on my watch, but maybe you do and                |
| 05:39      | Apple has built it for you.                                                                              |
| 05:41      | So, but the point of this sidebar is you look over there and you can get access not only                 |
| 05:46      | to all your shortcuts, but you can also get access to the ones that are in the share sheet               |
| 05:49      | and the ones that are in the watch and it just really simplifies that process and thumbs                 |
| 05:56      | up from me.                                                                                              |
| 05:57      | Now, on the iPhone, it's not as easy, but it does have like a slide view so you can get                  |
| 06:03      | back to that folder and smart folder list.                                                               |
| 06:08      | So you still have the same benefit.                                                                      |
| 06:09      | You just don't have the existing sidebar because there's not enough screen real estate.                  |
| 06:13      | Yeah, exactly, which makes sense.                                                                        |
| 06:16      | And I've only got a regular size iPhone, so I'm not sure if it does the landscape thing                  |
| 06:20      | with the sidebar on the Max phones, but I've just got a good old 11 pro.                                 |
| 06:25      | I will give you an answer, a live answer.                                                                |
| 06:28      | No, it does not.                                                                                         |
| 06:29      | Oh, drama.                                                                                               |
| 06:30      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 06:31      | Fair enough.                                                                                             |
| 06:32      | I mean, I never use the big phone on the side the way I don't think anybody does.                        |
| 06:37      | I very much doubt it.                                                                                    |
| 06:38      | I pretty much exclusively use my phone in portrait mode as in it's locked in portrait                    |
| 06:43      | mode most of the time because there's nothing worse than you're like you're you've tilted                |
| 06:48      | it slightly to one side and it decides, oh, I'm tilted enough that I must rotate.                        |
| 06:52      | And so you're looking at something and then I think it's an iOS bug where a lot of things                |
| 06:57      | like they'll they'll they'll rotate and then you'll lose your place because it just moves                |
| 07:01      | things up and down enough that it's confused about where it was.                                         |
| 07:05      | You know, I forgot to add that on the the smart folder groups with the phone, it adds                    |
| 07:11      | a fourth a sleep mode group.                                                                             |
| 07:14      | So when you're using the sleep mode, if you have shortcuts attached to sleep mode, you'll                |
| 07:18      | see them there as well.                                                                                  |
| 07:19      | You don't see that on the iPad.                                                                          |
| 07:20      | No, but you'll only see that folder if you have sleep mode shortcuts attached because                    |
| 07:24      | for a while I was trying to figure out why I didn't have this and it was because I didn't                |
| 07:28      | have any shortcuts attached to it.                                                                       |
| 07:29      | Oh, really?                                                                                              |
| 07:30      | Because I don't have any either.                                                                         |
| 07:31      | It just shows a count of zero for me.                                                                    |
| 07:33      | So maybe they change that in the process.                                                                |
| 07:36      | Well for me, I never had any attached to it and I was wondering why it wasn't showing                    |
| 07:40      | up.                                                                                                      |
| 07:41      | And then I came up with the bright idea on on iOS 14 launch day of trying to add a shortcut              |
| 07:45      | as a sleep shortcut and that works.                                                                      |
| 07:47      | So the folder is there.                                                                                  |
| 07:48      | So are you using sleep mode?                                                                             |
| 07:51      | So I've been trying a sleep mode for the last sort of week or so with shortcuts again.                   |
| 07:57      | And it's pretty cool.                                                                                    |
| 07:58      | But my biggest problem is that I am not consistently going to bed at the same time every night           |
| 08:02      | just because I'm still doing a lot of unpacking and everything here.                                     |
| 08:07      | So I get sidetracked into doing a pile of ironing or something and putting things away.                  |
| 08:12      | And then before I know it, it's 11 p.m. instead of the 10, 30 p.m. that I intended all going             |
| 08:16      | to sleep at.                                                                                             |
| 08:17      | And so if I have a shortcut, do things like turn off all the lights, then I'll be wandering              |
| 08:20      | around and suddenly everything will go dark, which is not quite what I intended.                         |
| 08:25      | I really like the idea.                                                                                  |
| 08:27      | I mean, just kind of the human engineering where it's the phone stops kind of working                    |
| 08:33      | and the watch too at the designated time for you to go to sleep and it requires, I mean,                 |
| 08:38      | you can unlock it, but it requires extra steps.                                                          |
| 08:41      | And I kind of like that that the reminder.                                                               |
| 08:43      | So I've been using sleep mode.                                                                           |
| 08:45      | I'm still struggling, you know, to keep my watch charged appropriately.                                  |
| 08:50      | Sometimes I put it on or, you know, this is the one you put it on the charger and then                   |
| 08:56      | you go in the other room and then three hours have passed and you've lost your standing                  |
| 09:00      | rings for the day.                                                                                       |
| 09:01      | You know, it's like, damn it.                                                                            |
| 09:02      | But you can change those now with iOS 14.                                                                |
| 09:05      | They fix that in watchOS.                                                                                |
| 09:06      | So you can actually change the number of stand hours you need to do a day.                               |
| 09:09      | Yeah, but I think 12 is a fair number.                                                                   |
| 09:12      | But the...                                                                                               |
| 09:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:14      | I'm fixing that by putting Apple Watch chargers everywhere.                                              |
| 09:16      | So this is one of the things that I'm doing because that way, because I noticed shortly                  |
| 09:20      | after moving that I was charging my watch in the bedroom and I was sitting at my desk                    |
| 09:23      | and I didn't want to get up to go and get my watch when I got the notification on my                     |
| 09:26      | phone to say the watch battery was full.                                                                 |
| 09:30      | And so I just decided that the simple solution to this problem was to put a watch charger                |
| 09:34      | on my desk, which has, I am pleased to report, solved the problem.                                       |
| 09:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:39      | And, you know, Mr. Fancy Automator, all I have to do is set a timer.                                     |
| 09:41      | I've got my phone in my pocket still.                                                                    |
| 09:44      | But you know, Mr. Dummy lets the alarm go off and say, oh, well, I'm doing something right               |
| 09:49      | now.                                                                                                     |
| 09:50      | I'll go get it in a minute.                                                                              |
| 09:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:52      | Just a minute.                                                                                           |
| 09:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:55      | You're human just like the rest of us, David.                                                            |
| 09:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 09:57      | Maybe I need to like wire it so it electrocutes me or something five minutes later.                      |
| 10:01      | Just, you know, take it to the next level.                                                               |
| 10:02      | I mean, I'm sure if you asked your kids, you know, they'd be willing to follow you around                |
| 10:06      | with a taser or something.                                                                               |
| 10:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 10:08      | Or cattle prod.                                                                                          |
| 10:09      | I mean, my kids are pretty smart.                                                                        |
| 10:10      | Either way.                                                                                              |
| 10:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 10:12      | So you've got the sidebars and then the big win on the sidebars is the addition of folders.              |
| 10:17      | I mean, this isn't rocket science.                                                                       |
| 10:20      | You and I have been talking about the need for organisational tools for a long time.                     |
| 10:24      | I never believed Apple was going to put a tagging system on the iPhone for shortcuts                     |
| 10:30      | because I just don't believe they really sold on tagging, but the folders make a lot                     |
| 10:35      | of sense.                                                                                                |
| 10:36      | They show up in the sidebar.                                                                             |
| 10:38      | Now, there's a couple of ways you can interact with them.                                                |
| 10:40      | You can just drag apps into the sidebars right from your view or you can go into individual              |
| 10:47      | folders and drag shortcuts out of that folder and put it into another one on the sidebar,                |
| 10:52      | which I find to be the easiest way to move them around.                                                  |
| 10:55      | You can also assign them on the individual shortcuts.                                                    |
| 10:59      | They gave us all the expected ways to organise and you can have a glyph for each folder,                 |
| 11:06      | so they all don't have folder icons.                                                                     |
| 11:08      | They can have different glyphs attached.                                                                 |
| 11:10      | You cannot adjust the colour, which would be kind of nice if you could, you know, kind                    |
| 11:14      | of, because you've got two ways, you've got the object and you've got the colour, so allow                |
| 11:19      | your brain to get to the right folder faster.                                                            |
| 11:22      | But you know, I understand it's Apple.                                                                   |
| 11:24      | They want it to look pretty.                                                                             |
| 11:25      | They want a bunch of ugly colours spread out, but I feel like overall, they did a good job                |
| 11:31      | giving us this organisational tool.                                                                      |
| 11:33      | What's your take on it?                                                                                  |
| 11:34      | I mean, I think it's great.                                                                              |
| 11:36      | I particularly love the way that the folders integrate with widgets, which I'm going to                  |
| 11:40      | kind of skip ahead to here, because they're the new widgets on the home screen of iOS 14.                |
| 11:46      | They've gone viral, as has Widgetsmith and a whole bunch of other widget apps.                           |
| 11:50      | Colour widget is another one I'm playing with.                                                            |
| 11:52      | And I find that the widgets are great because you can say, just give me the widgets in it.               |
| 11:59      | Just give me shortcuts in a specific folder and it'll give you the first one, four, eight                |
| 12:03      | shortcuts in that folder, depending on the size of the widget you pick, which is not                     |
| 12:08      | as many as if you had put them, say, on the home screen of your device.                                  |
| 12:12      | And because of the widget limitations on iPad OS, I kind of prefer still the home screen                 |
| 12:17      | view there.                                                                                              |
| 12:18      | But if they're in a widget, then they don't need to open shortcuts to run, which is really               |
| 12:22      | nice.                                                                                                    |
| 12:23      | And I just wish that something could be in multiple folders like, hey, say a tagging                     |
| 12:28      | system so that I could specify that this shortcut belongs in this folder on my iPhone, but in            |
| 12:35      | this folder on my iPad, because I want different widgets on different devices, but I don't               |
| 12:39      | necessarily want different shortcuts on different devices, you know, I'll want some of the same          |
| 12:45      | shortcuts everywhere.                                                                                    |
| 12:46      | So I'm trying to figure that out at the moment.                                                          |
| 12:48      | It's tricky, but I might be getting somewhere.                                                           |
| 12:50      | I'm not sure.                                                                                            |
| 12:51      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 12:52      | We've gone down the rabbit hole of widgets.                                                              |
| 12:55      | Actually, let's just finish up on folders.                                                               |
| 12:57      | I think there's nothing wrong with making a lot of folders.                                              |
| 13:01      | If you've got a big shortcuts library, this really does solve the problem for me, whereas                |
| 13:07      | before it took forever to find things, even though I had this very, you know, complicated                |
| 13:13      | colour coding system and everything, this has just really solved the problem.                             |
| 13:18      | And if I think about all the time I wasted trying to arrange shortcuts before iOS 14,                    |
| 13:24      | I'm very happy that I no longer have to do that.                                                         |
| 13:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 13:28      | I'm very happy that I decided early on that I had too many shortcuts to do this with.                    |
| 13:33      | And therefore, I just left everything pretty much whatever colour it was assigned to on                   |
| 13:37      | iOS at most of the time, whatever icon iOS assigned to the magic wand, because I saw                     |
| 13:42      | other people changing things and this stuff would magically get changed back, whether                    |
| 13:47      | it was the ordering of shortcuts or the, you know, what they look like.                                  |
| 13:51      | And I decided that that was not for me if it was going to revert.                                        |
| 13:54      | So I'm very happy.                                                                                       |
| 13:55      | I skipped straight into the folder section there.                                                        |
| 13:58      | How many folders for us?                                                                                 |
| 13:59      | How many?                                                                                                |
| 14:00      | I actually don't have many.                                                                              |
| 14:01      | So obviously I've got the starter shortcuts folder because I'm going to keep those around                |
| 14:04      | and see what else pops up.                                                                               |
| 14:06      | I've got a folder for server shortcuts as run by my push cut automation server.                          |
| 14:13      | And I've got a couple of different home screen folders, which I'm experimenting with at the              |
| 14:17      | moment.                                                                                                  |
| 14:18      | And then I've got some folders for different areas of my life.                                           |
| 14:21      | So for example, work, screencasts online, sweet setup, et cetera, they all have their                    |
| 14:25      | own folders.                                                                                             |
| 14:26      | I have way more folders than that.                                                                       |
| 14:29      | I'm not surprised.                                                                                       |
| 14:30      | I have contextual folders.                                                                               |
| 14:31      | I have app folders.                                                                                      |
| 14:32      | Like I have one for OmniFocus, but I also have one for SparksLaw.                                        |
| 14:36      | And I've got, I've got, I love the fact that I have a testing folder now because I always                |
| 14:42      | have two or three that I'm testing and I have one for ideas and they, you know, it's just                |
| 14:47      | been great.                                                                                              |
| 14:48      | And I don't have any problem with having folders with two or three shortcuts in them because             |
| 14:53      | it just makes it so much easier to find them.                                                            |
| 14:56      | I also have them for like media and camera or photos and things like that.                               |
| 15:00      | So yeah, go crazy with the folders gang.                                                                 |
| 15:03      | They're free.                                                                                            |
| 15:04      | You can have as many as you want.                                                                        |
| 15:06      | I have, thanks to you and your testing folder, just created a new folder called Temp in which            |
| 15:11      | I will create shortcuts that I intend to dispose of so that then I can go in there and delete            |
| 15:16      | all the shortcuts at some point because, you know, I, I, I frequently create shortcuts                   |
| 15:21      | for a one-time use, like the other day I had to get some data out of a Trello board and                  |
| 15:25      | format it in Markdown.                                                                                   |
| 15:28      | And so I did that with shortcuts, but then of course I forgot to delete the shortcut                     |
| 15:32      | and then a couple of hours later was like, what, what is this shortcut?                                  |
| 15:34      | Why do I have a shortcut seven and also where shortcuts one through six.                                 |
| 15:40      | And so I had to delete this.                                                                             |
| 15:41      | So I now have a temp folder.                                                                             |
| 15:43      | So thank you, David.                                                                                     |
| 15:44      | You're welcome.                                                                                          |
| 15:45      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 15:46      | Widgets, you mentioned earlier, but I just want to put an exclamation point on it.                       |
| 15:50      | Shortcuts running out of widgets are first class citizens and historically the shortcuts                 |
| 15:56      | running on your home screen have been second class citizens.                                             |
| 15:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 15:59      | So what was it?                                                                                          |
| 16:00      | I was 12 where they would open [[Safari]] and then shortcuts, which was, and you'd end up                    |
| 16:05      | with a whole bunch of empty [[Safari]] tabs, which were not great.                                           |
| 16:09      | And then I was 13, they, they decided that they could skip [[Safari]].                                       |
| 16:12      | And so if you had a shortcut on your home screen and this holds true and I was 14, then                  |
| 16:17      | it just opens the shortcuts app and runs it there, but that means that you get to look                   |
| 16:21      | at it running.                                                                                           |
| 16:23      | And now with iOS 14 with the widgets, if you tap on it in a widget, then it kind of runs                 |
| 16:29      | as an overlay on your screen, which I love because I can still see whatever it is I was                  |
| 16:34      | looking at and frequently when I'm running a shortcut, it's because I've just seen something             |
| 16:39      | and I'm like, ah, and if I, if it stays in my field of view, then, then I'm good and                     |
| 16:44      | I can, you know, I can remember it.                                                                      |
| 16:46      | If it disappears from my field of view and shortcuts hides it from me, then I will absolutely            |
| 16:51      | forget what it was that I was going to do in that particular second.                                     |
| 16:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 16:54      | I mean, with the widget run, it feels like it's part of the operating system instead                     |
| 16:57      | of being an individual app, which I think is far superior.                                               |
| 17:02      | I think it's faster, but maybe it's just my head thinking it's faster because I don't                    |
| 17:07      | see the app open, but have you done any tests?                                                           |
| 17:10      | Do you know if it runs faster?                                                                           |
| 17:12      | I haven't, I haven't tested it.                                                                          |
| 17:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 17:14      | But in my experience, it runs really quickly.                                                            |
| 17:18      | So if, if I can, I prefer to run things through the widgets and I, I'm starting to get into              |
| 17:23      | the system that you have where I have multiple menus and under those menus, you know, those              |
| 17:28      | menus run shortcuts based on what I'm doing.                                                             |
| 17:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 17:31      | And I explained this at length in the, the update to the shortcuts field guy, but the                    |
| 17:34      | choose from menu is your friend here because with the widget, the, each button in the widget             |
| 17:41      | takes the equivalent of two app slots and, and that's, if you have the medium widget,                    |
| 17:47      | that means you only get to run four shortcuts.                                                           |
| 17:48      | If you have the large one, you only get to run eight, but it's taking the large ones                     |
| 17:52      | taking the space of 18 of 16 apps slots, but only has eight shortcuts you can run.                       |
| 17:59      | So using choose from menu, the way I do is contextually, I have like MacSparky, Sparks                  |
| 18:04      | law, personal, and then the fourth one I call directories and it's a bunch of additional                 |
| 18:09      | choose from menus, like all my photos related stuff is a choose from menu that's, so it's                |
| 18:14      | like two layers.                                                                                         |
| 18:15      | You first you hit the directories, then you hit the photos and then it gets you to a list                |
| 18:18      | of all those shortcuts, um, which sounds pedantic, but it actually works really fast when it             |
| 18:24      | feels like it's integrated into the operating system and it's, that's snappy and I'm able                |
| 18:28      | to get all my shortcuts into four buttons, but they are on my home screen 24 seven.                      |
| 18:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 18:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 18:36      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 18:37      | That's the thing.                                                                                        |
| 18:38      | What I do with this beyond that, you know, I, I have stuff, so, um, I, I have things and                 |
| 18:42      | I'm one of the ones that I'm experimenting with, which is not working super great right                  |
| 18:46      | now.                                                                                                     |
| 18:47      | So I'm not going to share it just yet is I'm trying to get it to show me a dynamic list                  |
| 18:50      | of shortcuts based on the time of day and stuff that's going on.                                         |
| 18:54      | So, so checks my calendar and if it sees something in the automators calendar, but show me automators    |
| 18:58      | stuff.                                                                                                   |
| 18:59      | Um, and if it sees something in the nested folders calendar, show me nested folder stuff.                |
| 19:03      | Um, but it's, it's kind of janky right now and I'm not particularly proud of it.                         |
| 19:07      | Uh, there, there's a lot of [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] and some weird widget T stuff in there.                           |
| 19:11      | Um, that's kind of hacky, but I, I'm hoping that I can get this working at some point                    |
| 19:17      | and it will show me a dynamic list of shortcuts based on the time of day so that then I can              |
| 19:21      | have a couple of other ones, like one I'm using all the time is add stuff to my shopping                 |
| 19:25      | list so I can just type a list of things and it'll just break it up and stick it on.                     |
| 19:29      | And that I would love to keep on my home screen just because one tap add things done.                    |
| 19:34      | But you know, I also need lots of other shortcuts.                                                       |
| 19:38      | So that one you were just describing is I would assume you press the button and then                     |
| 19:43      | the shortcut checks the time of day, maybe the day of week, maybe even checks future                     |
| 19:47      | appointments.                                                                                            |
| 19:48      | Yep.                                                                                                     |
| 19:49      | And it's looking at timer as well to see if I've got a timer running, um, to, you know,                  |
| 19:54      | and what timer that is.                                                                                  |
| 19:56      | Um, so that it can, you know, actually, you know, figure out, Hey, like, oh, you're currently            |
| 20:01      | working.                                                                                                 |
| 20:02      | And therefore you might actually want your work related shortcuts as well.                               |
| 20:05      | Um, but yeah, it's a, it's an interesting way of doing things and I'm quite, I'm quite                   |
| 20:11      | liking the idea, but as I said, it's a bit janky.                                                        |
| 20:13      | Well, it'd be kind of fun though as an automated or experiment just to think how many pieces             |
| 20:18      | of logic could you add because the easiest way to do it just be time of day and day of                   |
| 20:23      | week.                                                                                                    |
| 20:24      | And if you have a regular schedule, let's say that, you know, every week you have at                     |
| 20:28      | your business, you have a staff meeting Wednesday morning.                                               |
| 20:32      | So you could say, if it's Wednesday morning, give me the shortcuts that I would use for                  |
| 20:35      | the staff meeting.                                                                                       |
| 20:37      | That would be the easiest way to do that.                                                                |
| 20:39      | But when you're trying to like take it a step further, because we don't have a set recording             |
| 20:43      | time for automators, so it's going to be checking the calendar.                                          |
| 20:47      | I'm looking forward to see what you do with that.                                                        |
| 20:49      | I mean, I think if anybody could pull that off, it'd be you.                                             |
| 20:51      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 20:52      | I'm really excited.                                                                                      |
| 20:53      | I'm also really excited to see what other developers come up with because I've noticed                   |
| 20:57      | that some apps, I think it was Launcher just updated with widgets support for iOS 14.                    |
| 21:05      | And you know, one of the actions that you can do with one of, you know, one of the launchers             |
| 21:09      | in their launcher in their widget is run a shortcut.                                                     |
| 21:15      | And so I'd be really interested in being able to build my logic maybe somewhere else and                 |
| 21:19      | have that run a shortcut.                                                                                |
| 21:21      | Except then you're going to be launching the shortcuts app and kind of lose that pretty                  |
| 21:26      | benefit of the widget.                                                                                   |
| 21:30      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint.                   |
| 21:34      | I love finding new podcasts to listen to.                                                                |
| 21:36      | It's something about the combination of a great topic along with some great hosts and                    |
| 21:40      | some great guests that really make it work.                                                              |
| 21:43      | And yes, all three of them do need to be great.                                                          |
| 21:45      | If you're looking for a new show to listen to, the Intrazone is a biweekly podcast with                  |
| 21:49      | conversations and interviews on how Microsoft SharePoint, OneDrive and related tech can work             |
| 21:54      | for you.                                                                                                 |
| 21:55      | You'll hear from guest experts behind the scenes and out in the field so you can see                     |
| 21:59      | how SharePoint fits into your everyday work life to easily share and manage content, knowledge           |
| 22:04      | and applications.                                                                                        |
| 22:06      | Each show covers a bunch of segments like news and announcements, a focus topic of the week,             |
| 22:11      | guest perspective, FAQs of the week and upcoming events.                                                 |
| 22:15      | And just so you have an idea of what to expect, I want to tell you about some of the topics              |
| 22:18      | you might be interested in that were on previous episodes.                                               |
| 22:21      | They've discussed working from home, which I know is relevant to quite a few of you,                     |
| 22:25      | and also figuring out an intelligent intranet in your organisation.                                      |
| 22:28      | Oh, and they did an episode about talking about APIs and teamwork as well, which you                     |
| 22:33      | should definitely give a try.                                                                            |
| 22:35      | I recently listened to their episode on tasks in teams.                                                  |
| 22:38      | We've been rolling at Microsoft Teams at work and trying to figure out how we can actually               |
| 22:42      | integrate tasks into this so that everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing and                  |
| 22:46      | when is a challenge, but with a little bit of extra insight, we seem to be doing things                  |
| 22:51      | pretty well rolling it out.                                                                              |
| 22:53      | Go ahead and listen to it now.                                                                           |
| 22:55      | Just search for the intro zone wherever you get your podcasts.                                           |
| 22:58      | That's I-N-T-R-A-Z-O-N-E, or just click the link in the show notes.                                      |
| 23:04      | Go check it out.                                                                                         |
| 23:05      | Our thanks to the intro zone by Microsoft SharePoint for their support of this show and                  |
| 23:09      | all of Relay FM.                                                                                         |
| 23:10      | All right, so getting out of the folders and into the shortcuts themselves, there's still                |
| 23:15      | a few more quality of life improvements.                                                                 |
| 23:18      | One is the ability to copy and duplicate shortcut actions.                                               |
| 23:22      | Finally.                                                                                                 |
| 23:23      | Who did you name in?                                                                                     |
| 23:25      | Finally.                                                                                                 |
| 23:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 23:27      | Because this finally means that all of those [[Airtable]] shortcuts, I no longer have to make                |
| 23:32      | sure that I am putting all of the right info in every time.                                              |
| 23:36      | I can just copy it and copy and get contents of URL with the [[Airtable]] info and then paste                |
| 23:43      | or duplicate it or do whatever because if you tap on the, you need to tap on the tiny                    |
| 23:48      | little app icon representation of the action in the top left and then there's a duplicate,               |
| 23:54      | there's copy.                                                                                            |
| 23:55      | And if you copied something, then there's also a paste above and paste below, which                      |
| 24:00      | is perfect.                                                                                              |
| 24:01      | I love it.                                                                                               |
| 24:02      | It works.                                                                                                |
| 24:03      | It's solid.                                                                                              |
| 24:05      | It does everything I need.                                                                               |
| 24:07      | And I just want to say thank you to the shortcuts team because it genuinely makes my life so             |
| 24:11      | much easier.                                                                                             |
| 24:12      | And if you got a mouse or trackpad connected to right click, we'll do the same thing.                    |
| 24:15      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 24:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 24:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 24:18      | So it's great.                                                                                           |
| 24:19      | And that combines with the other new feature is the ability to run shortcuts and split screen,           |
| 24:22      | which is really beneficial on iPad where you can, I find it when I'm using two different                 |
| 24:26      | shortcuts, like I've got one I built and then I want to build another one kind of like it,               |
| 24:31      | but I need the reference.                                                                                |
| 24:33      | So I will put, you know, on the right side, I'll put the old one on the left side, I'll                  |
| 24:37      | put the new one and you can copy and paste actions between them.                                         |
| 24:41      | So it's pretty nice.                                                                                     |
| 24:43      | It feels like a, you know, it just feels like an adult app when you start getting features               |
| 24:48      | like that.                                                                                               |
| 24:49      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 24:50      | It really does.                                                                                          |
| 24:51      | It's, it's a very grown app and yeah, it works great because I mean, that's, that's what                 |
| 24:55      | I do with a lot of my, my air table things.                                                              |
| 24:57      | I'm looking at two different shortcuts and before I was having to go back and, you know,                 |
| 25:01      | open one shortcut and then close it and go to the other and paste and open one.                          |
| 25:05      | And it was very slow going.                                                                              |
| 25:07      | I take screenshots, but I'd still miss info, stuff like that.                                            |
| 25:10      | Now I can just open up two shortcuts at the same time on my iPad, which is great.                        |
| 25:14      | And I have to say, David, 12.9 inch iPad, probably in my future.                                         |
| 25:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 25:19      | Well, I also think that even like when you knew what you wanted to do, like it was a                     |
| 25:22      | URL callback or some of the more complicated actions, it's just so easy to make a little                 |
| 25:27      | typo, you know, and, and when you can just copy an existing one, it just takes that out                  |
| 25:33      | of the equation.                                                                                         |
| 25:34      | I, I'm very happy with that.                                                                             |
| 25:36      | If I could ask for a little bit more as a regular [[Keyboard Maestro]] user, I'm used to                     |
| 25:41      | with Keyboard Maestro's ability to block and copy multiple actions at once.                              |
| 25:46      | So I like copy entire subroutines and [[Keyboard Maestro]], you know, you just select a bunch                |
| 25:50      | of actions, hit command C and with this, you're going to do one at a time.                               |
| 25:55      | I actually would, there must be a way, if they, if they have them, you know, software                    |
| 26:00      | to copy an action, there's no reason why they couldn't have the software to copy multiple                |
| 26:05      | actions.                                                                                                 |
| 26:06      | They're probably just struggling on what's the UI for that.                                              |
| 26:08      | How do you pick the multiple actions?                                                                    |
| 26:10      | But I would totally be okay with it only being available if you're using a mouse or a track              |
| 26:15      | pad.                                                                                                     |
| 26:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 26:17      | I was just thinking like hold down the shift key and arrow down.                                         |
| 26:19      | And if you don't have a track or keyboard or something like that, like, you know, if,                    |
| 26:23      | if it's a pro user feature, the vast majority of us pro users are going to be using either,              |
| 26:27      | you know, appointing device as Apple still calls them or keyboard attached to our iPads.                 |
| 26:32      | And especially with the magic keyboard and that new iPad era that supports the magic                     |
| 26:35      | keyboard, um, I believe, um, then, you know, I think we're, we're, you know, in for a lot                |
| 26:42      | more fun on that front in the future.                                                                    |
| 26:45      | And I think it's a pro feature, just the act of copying and pasting a shortcut action,                   |
| 26:50      | like people who are going to want to do that are already deep in.                                        |
| 26:55      | So you can give us a difficult interface.                                                                |
| 26:58      | We will figure it out because we're, we're by, by definition, people that are copying                    |
| 27:02      | and pasting short connections can handle it, you know, self-selecting group.                             |
| 27:07      | Um, yeah, now we talked in, right after dub dub, we talked about the, uh, the new triggers               |
| 27:15      | and I kind of came to this term as I was working on the field guide, but automatic automation.           |
| 27:21      | It's like, you know, this is something that I just want to acknowledge, you know, uh,                    |
| 27:27      | this year, I guess Apple, for whatever reason, didn't trust us enough on some of these shortcuts.        |
| 27:32      | So you could have automatic shortcuts, but they wouldn't trigger unless you tapped a                     |
| 27:37      | confirmation dialogue.                                                                                   |
| 27:39      | And this year they've removed that from nearly all of them.                                              |
| 27:43      | And the trick is when you create the, the shortcut, it shows, it's all done under the                    |
| 27:47      | automation tab.                                                                                          |
| 27:49      | So you go to that centre automation tab, make a personal automation.                                     |
| 27:52      | And after you create the, the trigger and the shortcut, there's a checkbox at the bottom                 |
| 27:56      | says ask before running.                                                                                 |
| 27:58      | And by default, it's turned on.                                                                          |
| 28:00      | They just really don't want you to be surprised by shortcuts going off, but, um, my advice               |
| 28:05      | is every time you see that button, uncheck it.                                                           |
| 28:08      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                        |
| 28:09      | You know, if you want your shortcut to run automatically, I wish it ran automatically                    |
| 28:13      | with the, the, the new triggers for a message and email, because I have been experimenting               |
| 28:20      | with the message one, uh, less with the email one because, uh, I've, uh, I've temporarily                |
| 28:26      | switched to Spark because it supports the, the new iOS 14 default mail client things.                    |
| 28:31      | And I have not found that this runs when it receives a message in Spark.                                 |
| 28:35      | So I'm hoping we're going to see something a little bit more integration-y with that.                    |
| 28:38      | But, uh, the message one, as far as I'm aware, if I, if I type in David Sparks, um, and say              |
| 28:45      | when David sends me a message, I cannot turn off the, the ask when run, which is a real                  |
| 28:50      | shame because I would love it to come and go into my OmniFocus and get a list of things                  |
| 28:55      | that I wanted to talk to you about and just pop it up as a little, you know, show result                 |
| 28:59      | for me and say, Hey, you wanted to talk to David about these things because I know you                   |
| 29:03      | can do that in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] where you can assign a specific, you know, like reminder to remind              |
| 29:07      | me when messaging this person, but it's not the same.                                                    |
| 29:11      | I want, I want all my stuff in one place.                                                                |
| 29:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 29:14      | I agree with you.                                                                                        |
| 29:15      | And there, there's three that it has this location incoming message and incoming email                   |
| 29:20      | and the result is it cripples those three triggers.                                                      |
| 29:23      | I mean, because you just can't use them like the email one would work for me too, because                |
| 29:27      | I'm often working on like transactions with other lawyers on behalf of clients and you                   |
| 29:33      | know, that business runs on email doesn't run on messages.                                               |
| 29:36      | And so it'd be great if an incoming email came in from someone I'm negotiating a contract                |
| 29:41      | from and it, you know, set the timer for that project.                                                   |
| 29:45      | And you know, I, I can think of a list right now of things I would like to do, you know,                 |
| 29:49      | open up [[Drafts]] note where I can take notes from the conversation and you know, all this                  |
| 29:52      | stuff, but it just won't happen without that confirmation.                                               |
| 29:57      | And it almost feels like, then what's the point?                                                         |
| 29:59      | I kind of find it amazing really that they didn't have a phone trigger.                                  |
| 30:05      | So when my phone rings and it's a specific person, then automatically, you know, I'd                     |
| 30:09      | like have the ability to run a shortcut because that could be, you know, quite useful as well.           |
| 30:15      | Same way you're using it for email, I could imagine it, you know, the opposition calls                   |
| 30:18      | and you'd also like to, you know, be able to start your timer then for that, but you                     |
| 30:23      | know, they didn't.                                                                                       |
| 30:24      | I think Apple's logic is we don't want someone else to trigger a shortcut on your device                 |
| 30:30      | by contacting you, but they don't even have an option to, to have an ask and run trigger.                |
| 30:36      | That's the thing, you know, what is the iPhone?                                                          |
| 30:38      | I thought it was supposed to be a phone as well.                                                         |
| 30:40      | I mean, I admittedly really use it as such, but yeah, I was just talking kind of generically,            |
| 30:45      | I don't want to send you a text message and fire off a shortcut, I guess there's some                    |
| 30:49      | scenario where there's a shortcut on your device that does things they don't want it                     |
| 30:54      | to do and then someone sends you the message.                                                            |
| 30:57      | I could see people setting it up as a prank, but at the same time you could use an open                  |
| 31:02      | app as a prank as well.                                                                                  |
| 31:03      | So, you know, I just, you know, I just trust us, you know, it's our phone.                               |
| 31:10      | I have a passcode on it so other people can't get in there and set pranks on my devices.                 |
| 31:15      | Then location is another one and we can get around it with, this is kind of going negative               |
| 31:19      | because, you know, they've given us all the candy we want, but there's three pieces of                   |
| 31:23      | chocolate that we're not allowed to take out of the box and it is frustrating.                           |
| 31:27      | But, but, you know, location is another one where I can think of a lot of cool automation                |
| 31:32      | I'd like to do if the automate, the location automation would work without me having to                  |
| 31:36      | pull my foot out of my pocket and say, okay, yes, do that.                                               |
| 31:39      | But let's talk about the new triggers and the existing triggers and what you can do                      |
| 31:45      | with them with this automatic automation.                                                                |
| 31:48      | The one I find myself using by far the most is just the time trigger, you know, just the                 |
| 31:53      | time of day.                                                                                             |
| 31:55      | Have you done any automation with the new iOS 14 and time triggers?                                      |
| 32:00      | So I have not because I already had push cut automation servers set up on an iPhone 6s                   |
| 32:06      | to do all this stuff, and I like the fact that it happens on a specific iPhone rather                    |
| 32:11      | than my primary iPhone, which especially because it's running a beta, it has had less than               |
| 32:16      | fabulous battery life this year, which is a shame.                                                       |
| 32:20      | So I've been using the iPhone battery pack a lot of the time, but no, I mean, I've experimented          |
| 32:24      | with it to make sure it works and to, you know, to try things out.                                       |
| 32:28      | And I have recently been experimenting with using it as an alarm in the mornings.                        |
| 32:33      | So that instead of having an alarm on my phone, I have it automatically run a shortcut at                |
| 32:39      | a specific time, which I can change on a daily basis if I need to.                                       |
| 32:42      | And that will turn on some lights in my bedroom and play some music to an [[AirPlay]] speaker that           |
| 32:47      | I have in there.                                                                                         |
| 32:48      | Nice.                                                                                                    |
| 32:49      | Yeah, I think the time based triggers are very useful for someone like me because my days                |
| 32:53      | are fairly regimented.                                                                                   |
| 32:55      | Like in the morning, I do some MacSparky production podcasts, whatever, and the afternoon I put         |
| 33:01      | my lawyer hat on and I can do a whole bunch of different like mode switches on my phone                  |
| 33:06      | and even my watch based on time of day.                                                                  |
| 33:10      | And those time triggers are also on day of week.                                                         |
| 33:12      | So like if you've got like Sunday, you want to take the day off, you may have your phone                 |
| 33:16      | set up differently.                                                                                      |
| 33:18      | And I think the even as basic as it is just time of day without a confirmation dialogue                  |
| 33:24      | opens up a lot of opportunities for automation.                                                          |
| 33:27      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                            |
| 33:29      | It really does.                                                                                          |
| 33:30      | It's amazing, you know, just what this can really do for us.                                             |
| 33:35      | So another thing that they added for us, David, was the close app trigger because I was using            |
| 33:41      | open app for a lot of things and starting time is right left and centre.                                 |
| 33:44      | But I realised that I definitely had a problem in that I then had a lot of time is running               |
| 33:49      | and they wouldn't get stopped at the right time because there is no way to tell when                     |
| 33:53      | I closed an app to stop the timer.                                                                       |
| 33:57      | Well, I was 14 is fixed that for us.                                                                     |
| 33:58      | And you can have something run with an app opens closes or both, which is nice.                          |
| 34:05      | Unfortunately, there is still no way to find out which app was opened, and if it was opened              |
| 34:11      | or closed.                                                                                               |
| 34:12      | So I've had to set up lots of individual automations for this app was opened, this app was closed.       |
| 34:19      | And then what I'm doing is I've just got a text in there, a text field, and then I have                  |
| 34:23      | a run shortcut and I pass the text through to the run shortcut, so that I can, you know,                 |
| 34:28      | have a logic built into one shortcut for time tracking.                                                  |
| 34:32      | And I can tell it which shortcut is being, which app is being opened, or which app is                    |
| 34:37      | being closed.                                                                                            |
| 34:38      | So I've been doing those individually.                                                                   |
| 34:39      | So explain that to me one more time.                                                                     |
| 34:41      | I'm doing individually as well.                                                                          |
| 34:43      | So for example, I'll create one automation, which says when [[Drafts]] is opened, for example,               |
| 34:50      | and then inside of that automation, I add a text action, which I just type [[Drafts]] open                   |
| 34:55      | into.                                                                                                    |
| 34:56      | And then I add another action run shortcut, which runs my general time tracking, automated               |
| 35:04      | time tracking shortcut.                                                                                  |
| 35:05      | And then that automated time tracking shortcut splits, it gets the last word open or closed,             |
| 35:12      | and goes, okay, so this was opened.                                                                      |
| 35:13      | So I need to run, like go through this branch of logic, okay, and the app was [[Drafts]].                    |
| 35:18      | So actually, in this case, I'm going to show a menu and ask what you're doing and, you                   |
| 35:22      | know, log it that way.                                                                                   |
| 35:24      | But other apps like the Kindle app, for example, on my iPad mini, it just starts a reading               |
| 35:28      | timer for me without asking me anything.                                                                 |
| 35:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 35:31      | But I don't understand what the text field, what the text, what purposes.                                |
| 35:35      | So I pass the text through to the shortcut, so the shortcut knows which app was opened.                  |
| 35:39      | Instead of me building one shortcut for [[Drafts]] was opened, and another shortcut for [[Drafts]]              |
| 35:44      | was closed.                                                                                              |
| 35:45      | So I have one automated time tracking shortcut, and I tell it, I tell it something was opened            |
| 35:49      | or something was closed, and then which app it was, and it figures it out based on that.                 |
| 35:56      | Gotcha.                                                                                                  |
| 35:57      | So that, so you don't have an explosion of closing and opening shortcuts, you're able                    |
| 36:02      | to combine it.                                                                                           |
| 36:03      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 36:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 36:05      | I wanted to consolidate it as much as I could into one shortcut, because also, you know,                 |
| 36:09      | some apps run, you know, the same thing, basically.                                                      |
| 36:12      | So I didn't want to have to figure out everything and replicate it multiple times, even with             |
| 36:19      | the copy action that seemed a little bit silly.                                                          |
| 36:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 36:22      | The opening shortcut, I mean, seemed built for Timery, it's like the Timery guy must                     |
| 36:28      | be so happy, right?                                                                                      |
| 36:29      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 36:30      | And this year, they kind of closed the loop, giving you the ability to trigger when you                  |
| 36:33      | close.                                                                                                   |
| 36:35      | What other uses do you have for the open app and close app shortcuts other than time tracking?           |
| 36:41      | I also use it to toggle dark mode and screen brightness.                                                 |
| 36:46      | So when I open Google Maps, I always set the screen brightness to 100%, because I pretty                 |
| 36:52      | much exclusively use Google Maps when I'm driving.                                                       |
| 36:55      | And so that works great.                                                                                 |
| 36:57      | And then when I close Google Maps, then I set the screen brightness back to, you know,                   |
| 37:00      | my usual, I think it's around about 30%, which works perfectly.                                          |
| 37:06      | And when I open the Kindle app, I always toggle into dark mode.                                          |
| 37:09      | And when I close the Kindle app, I check whether or not it's after sunset.                               |
| 37:13      | And if it is, then I leave it in dark mode.                                                              |
| 37:15      | If it's not, then I set it back to light mode.                                                           |
| 37:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 37:18      | I do the same thing.                                                                                     |
| 37:19      | I also have sometimes where it'll set kind of atmosphere for me.                                         |
| 37:24      | Like there's certain things I do in like [[Day One]].                                                        |
| 37:28      | And if it's at night and it's [[Day One]], I can have it, you know, put some music on and so                 |
| 37:33      | you can like go further steps down the road.                                                             |
| 37:36      | But the beginning point for it is that an application is opening.                                        |
| 37:41      | And this is one that you've got the ability to turn off the, you know, confirmed dialogue                |
| 37:47      | box.                                                                                                     |
| 37:48      | So like all this stuff just becomes so much more useful this year.                                       |
| 37:52      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 37:53      | I really wish we could change the confirmed dialogue, because I have been experimenting                  |
| 37:58      | with this a lot.                                                                                         |
| 38:00      | And the number of notifications I get from shortcuts is, you know, your automation is                    |
| 38:06      | running, your automation is running, your automation is running.                                         |
| 38:08      | And then, and then it says, oh yeah.                                                                     |
| 38:11      | And then I, and then I actually have it most of the time, show results.                                  |
| 38:14      | So I know what it did.                                                                                   |
| 38:16      | And then it says, you know, oh yeah.                                                                     |
| 38:18      | So you took it off charge or, and you know, and therefore your shortcuts been completed                  |
| 38:22      | where it's, you know, double check to make sure that whether or not a low power mode should              |
| 38:27      | be on because that's something I'm using actually.                                                       |
| 38:29      | And I disconnect from power.                                                                             |
| 38:31      | If I'm charging my phone and I unplug it, if the battery is less than 50%, I enable low                  |
| 38:36      | power mode because I figure I was probably charging it for a reason.                                     |
| 38:40      | And therefore if I'm taking it off charge, then I'm going to, you know, want to keep                     |
| 38:43      | it that way.                                                                                             |

| 40:34      | Thanks again to Mint Mobile for their support of the automators and all of Relay FM.                     |
| 40:40      | I'd like to follow up right before the break.                                                            |
| 40:42      | We were talking about power mode and that's another new set of triggers and this kind of                 |
| 40:47      | really opens up the floodgates.                                                                          |
| 40:48      | You've got triggers now when you plug into power, when you unplug from power, it can actively            |
| 40:54      | monitor your power level.                                                                                |
| 40:56      | So when you go below a certain set or when you go above a certain power reading, I find                  |
| 41:03      | this pretty useful.                                                                                      |
| 41:05      | And this is another one that's automatic automation so you don't have to be involved.                    |
| 41:09      | I don't do the thing you do where it's under 50% you put in the sleep mode.                              |
| 41:13      | I actually, though, do have a thing where it drops below 50% it lowers the brightness                    |
| 41:19      | and I've got just a couple power saving things that kick in as I head toward lower power                 |
| 41:24      | mode without going as extreme as low power mode.                                                         |
| 41:28      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 41:29      | I've also found I've been toggling this one on and off or rather just getting rid of the                 |
| 41:33      | shortcut and then reactivating it.                                                                       |
| 41:35      | Some days I need low power mode from like 40% rather than 20%.                                           |
| 41:40      | And so I've been just checking to see whether or not the phone is below 40% and then it                  |
| 41:46      | does that.                                                                                               |
| 41:47      | And what I do actually when I toggle it off, I just change it back to 20% because then                   |
| 41:51      | you know, iOS is good, put it in low power mode anyway.                                                  |
| 41:55      | So I find that it's quite handy.                                                                         |
| 41:57      | But I find that connecting to a charger and disconnecting from a charger is also great                   |
| 42:02      | because if I pick up my phone at night, then most of the time it's for reasons.                          |
| 42:08      | So I have the lamp next to my bed just turned on to 1%.                                                  |
| 42:12      | But that's still, you know, it's plenty bright enough when you've just woken up if you need              |
| 42:16      | to check your phone.                                                                                     |
| 42:17      | But I've had a couple of calls recently which have gone through, you know, my do not disturb             |
| 42:20      | where everything's set up.                                                                               |
| 42:21      | Nothing bad has happened.                                                                                |
| 42:23      | But you know, somebody's called me and you know, it's been nice to not be lying there                    |
| 42:27      | in the dark, you know, because having the light makes you think that things will be                      |
| 42:30      | all right.                                                                                               |
| 42:31      | And it turns out everything was all right.                                                               |
| 42:33      | And people were just butt-dialing me at three o'clock in the morning.                                    |
| 42:36      | So you know, I need to potentially take them off my favourites list.                                      |
| 42:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 42:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 42:42      | But that is a feature now that I would recommend checking out and everybody can kind of make             |
| 42:47      | their own decisions if power is a problem for them, but if you find yourself running                     |
| 42:51      | out of battery into the evening and you know, like you hit low power mode at five o'clock                |
| 42:57      | p.m.                                                                                                     |
| 42:58      | So rather than get that, you could create a shortcut at 50% charge.                                      |
| 43:03      | You do dim it a little bit, you know, maybe there's, maybe you don't use Bluetooth radio,                |
| 43:07      | you can turn it off.                                                                                     |
| 43:08      | Just, you know, just you have to make your own decisions.                                                |
| 43:10      | But you can do these power saving steps where maybe then you don't get to low power mode                 |
| 43:15      | until bedtime and then you're, you know, you're getting more out of your phone.                          |
| 43:19      | I would like them to add a trigger for attaching power to the Apple Watch or disconnect the              |
| 43:25      | Apple Watch.                                                                                             |
| 43:26      | I would solve the problem I was talking about earlier.                                                   |
| 43:28      | I could have it auto create a timer for me or maybe even send me reminders.                              |
| 43:33      | You're still plugged in.                                                                                 |
| 43:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 43:35      | But, you know, hey, one step at a time.                                                                  |
| 43:37      | That's the problem with shortcuts for me is every time they give me something, I think                   |
| 43:40      | of something else I want, I feel kind of bad for them.                                                   |
| 43:44      | There's no win there.                                                                                    |
| 43:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 43:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 43:47      | It's a shame.                                                                                            |
| 43:48      | But, you know, we do it because we love the app, right?                                                  |
| 43:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 43:51      | Now watch faces, you can set watch faces now and I think that is amazing and I started                   |
| 43:59      | out doing them by time, you know, I talked earlier about, you know, contextual computing                 |
| 44:04      | and like in the morning I have a simple analog face because I'm working on usually making                |
| 44:09      | videos or writing.                                                                                       |
| 44:11      | I don't want a lot of data on my wrist and then at noon it switches to the infograph                     |
| 44:18      | modular, which because my legal practice, I have lots of phone calls planned like a                      |
| 44:24      | lot of time blocked.                                                                                     |
| 44:25      | So I always want to know what I'm doing and what I'm heading into and I get all that data                |
| 44:30      | on the digital watch and then I've been doing anything.                                                  |
| 44:33      | Now we're at six o'clock.                                                                                |
| 44:34      | I switched to the breathe app or the breathe face, which is a very simple face.                          |
| 44:38      | I'm not settled that that's going to be one for the evening, but it's a great reminder                   |
| 44:41      | if I find myself at seven o'clock, I'm still working.                                                    |
| 44:44      | I look at my watch and it's like, oh, hey, dummy, you're supposed to be taking a little                  |
| 44:47      | break and that just happens automatically.                                                               |
| 44:51      | There's no confirmation.                                                                                 |
| 44:52      | I turned off that so I get automatic automation and that's been great.                                   |
| 44:57      | Now I, this is something anybody can do.                                                                 |
| 45:00      | It's like a two step shortcut.                                                                           |
| 45:01      | It's like, what time is it set watch face?                                                               |
| 45:04      | There's nothing to it.                                                                                   |
| 45:06      | But I've been playing further and I have something too.                                                  |
| 45:09      | It's not quite ready to share yet, but I have all these podcast partners that are all over               |
| 45:14      | the world and I'm working on figuring out a way to say, okay, if I have a podcast for                    |
| 45:21      | automators that day, put up the, what they call that watch face, the time zone face.                     |
| 45:27      | I think it's TZM, I forget what they call it, but, and just give me the London time                      |
| 45:33      | so I can know exactly what time it is for Rose that day as we're preparing.                              |
| 45:37      | In fact, I've got it running right now.                                                                  |
| 45:40      | Right now it looks to me like it's a little past six for you.                                            |
| 45:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 45:44      | Almost seven.                                                                                            |
| 45:45      | Just about quarter to seven.                                                                             |
| 45:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 45:47      | And as Rose knows, but the listeners don't, I seem to never know what time it is for                     |
| 45:51      | Rose.                                                                                                    |
| 45:52      | But anyway.                                                                                              |
| 45:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 45:54      | David always messages me at like nine PM and it's like, oh wait, shouldn't you be in                     |
| 45:56      | bed?                                                                                                     |
| 45:57      | And it's like, okay, I'm not 80, David.                                                                  |
| 45:58      | Apparently, I want you to sleep a lot.                                                                   |
| 46:00      | I mean, I would not object to sleeping more.                                                             |
| 46:02      | Let's be honest, but nine PM is a bit early for me.                                                      |
| 46:06      | So I think this is totally doable.                                                                       |
| 46:09      | The experiments have worked so far, but I've got three different podcast partners and different          |
| 46:14      | things going on.                                                                                         |
| 46:15      | But like, I've got a couple of clients that are in Asia and if I have appointments set                   |
| 46:20      | with them, why not just give me a time zone for their time zone, like a half hour before.                |
| 46:25      | So I think this will be fun and changing watch faces can be more than just a time-based                  |
| 46:32      | automation.                                                                                              |
| 46:33      | And I'm just starting to kind of go down this rabbit hole, but as an automator, it gets                  |
| 46:39      | me excited.                                                                                              |
| 46:40      | Definitely.                                                                                              |
| 46:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 46:42      | So I've been tying this mostly to timers.                                                                |
| 46:46      | So I use Timery, as previously mentioned, to start and stop a lot of timers for my time                  |
| 46:53      | tracking.                                                                                                |
| 46:54      | And I have been making sure that it automatically changes my watch face to an appropriate watch          |
| 47:00      | face, so that I've got good information when I'm at work versus other things.                            |
| 47:05      | And that is working really well for me.                                                                  |
| 47:08      | What I am also loving, even though there's a sleep mode on Apple Watch, I have been disabling            |
| 47:13      | the always on screen and enabling theatre mode at around about nine PM every night on                    |
| 47:20      | my Apple Watch.                                                                                          |
| 47:21      | And I'm turning it off at eight AM.                                                                      |
| 47:23      | And that for me is great.                                                                                |
| 47:26      | Sometimes I sleep badly and the little dim screen every so often wakes me up or I wake                   |
| 47:32      | up and I've managed to change my watch face to something else.                                           |
| 47:35      | So being able to automatically set the sleep watch face, I have a specific sleep watch                   |
| 47:40      | face, which I use behind the sleep function of the Apple Watch, which is the really big                  |
| 47:47      | numbers.                                                                                                 |
| 47:48      | And that's it.                                                                                           |
| 47:49      | That is great because then it's kind of a reminder for me, a subtle reminder that I                      |
| 47:53      | should be getting ready to wind up things up and go to bed before the phone taps me                      |
| 47:58      | on the shoulder and goes, hey, you know, it's time to get ready for bed.                                 |
| 48:00      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 48:01      | I want to go back to the idea of using toggle timers to set watch faces.                                 |
| 48:06      | I think that's genius.                                                                                   |
| 48:08      | Well, whenever I start a timer, so I use shortcuts to start the timers.                                  |
| 48:12      | So I have just added a little thing to it that says, and set my watch face to this,                      |
| 48:17      | which works great, works brilliantly for me.                                                             |
| 48:21      | So like, there's no way to detect you changing the timer manually, like going into the Timer             |
| 48:26      | app.                                                                                                     |
| 48:27      | It would have to be a shortcut based setting, but then to add a change the watch face is                 |
| 48:33      | simple.                                                                                                  |
| 48:34      | I mean, there would be a way.                                                                            |
| 48:37      | What you could do is you could have shortcuts do the open app automation.                                |
| 48:42      | And whenever you open Timer, then it could wait for, say, 30 seconds to give you enough                  |
| 48:47      | time to start it.                                                                                        |
| 48:48      | Or currently running Timer and execute logic based on that.                                              |
| 48:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 48:52      | But it would have to be still open.                                                                      |
| 48:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 48:55      | Well, no, the app, the Timer doesn't have to still be open.                                              |
| 48:58      | It just has to have a running timer.                                                                     |
| 49:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 49:01      | But how would you query what the running timer is with a shortcut?                                       |
| 49:04      | I believe Timer has an action for that.                                                                  |
| 49:06      | I'm sure I've used it for other things.                                                                  |
| 49:08      | You know, I think it does.                                                                               |
| 49:09      | And I've just never used it.                                                                             |
| 49:10      | I'll look into that.                                                                                     |
| 49:11      | But the, now tell me, like, what, how many faces do you have?                                            |
| 49:16      | I mean, do you have, like, an automator's face?                                                          |
| 49:19      | I do.                                                                                                    |
| 49:20      | And it's red, you know, because red's in our automators logo.                                            |
| 49:25      | It is, I believe it's the, the infograph face.                                                           |
| 49:30      | Well, it's on your wrist.                                                                                |
| 49:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 49:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 49:34      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 49:35      | But there's a couple of different round faces and I'm just trying to figure out which                    |
| 49:38      | one it is because there's the chronograph, there's count up, there's GMT, I may actually                 |
| 49:43      | change it to GMT because I've just been looking and they have, well, GMT is because that's               |
| 49:49      | my time zone, right?                                                                                     |
| 49:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 49:51      | Oh, no, that is the new one.                                                                             |
| 49:52      | But they have, they have a blue and red one, which is automator's colour.                                 |
| 49:54      | So I'm about to change my, my automator's watch face.                                                    |
| 49:57      | I really wish you could rename these because you can't right now.                                        |
| 50:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:02      | The problem is when you go to pick the watch face, it just gives you the watch face name.                |
| 50:06      | But if you have multiple instances of it, it's just, they're all the same name.                          |
| 50:10      | You've got to know what order they're in on your watch or you're going to get the wrong                  |
| 50:13      | one.                                                                                                     |
| 50:14      | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 50:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:16      | I like that Rose.                                                                                        |
| 50:17      | I think I might go to an unhealthy place with that idea.                                                 |
| 50:22      | That's all I'm going to say.                                                                             |
| 50:23      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 50:24      | Well, I'm expecting feedback next episode, please.                                                       |
| 50:26      | All right.                                                                                               |
| 50:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 50:28      | Interesting.                                                                                             |
| 50:29      | What's the most unique face you have to match like a work task?                                          |
| 50:33      | I mean, I don't know if it's unique, but I'm using the California face with the rainbow                  |
| 50:39      | and the California numbers on it.                                                                        |
| 50:42      | So it's nice Roman numerals, Roman numerals from 10 onwards, but the others are digits.                  |
| 50:50      | And I, I set it to that around about 7pm unless something else is setting my, you know, setting          |
| 50:55      | my watch face for me.                                                                                    |
| 50:57      | So I actually do have a timer based one, which checks if Timery has an active timer running.             |
| 51:03      | And if it like, so say for example, I'm recording automators right now, is there going, ah, she's        |
| 51:07      | recording automators, well, I'll wait.                                                                   |
| 51:10      | And then it does the same thing.                                                                         |
| 51:11      | I believe that one runs at 7, 8 and 9pm.                                                                 |
| 51:14      | No, just 7 and 8pm right now because I have the other one running at 9pm.                                |
| 51:18      | That's what's running at 9.                                                                              |
| 51:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 51:20      | If you could do a check, another way to this is like, you know, run it from 6am to 10pm                  |
| 51:29      | hourly and just check Timery.                                                                            |
| 51:32      | I really wish shortcuts had the ability to say, I want to run this thing every hour                      |
| 51:38      | between these hours, because as it is right now, I have a whole series of automations,                   |
| 51:43      | which are just like 7am, 8am, 9am, 10pm.                                                                 |
| 51:47      | And most of them have got nothing in, but it just means that if I want to run a bunch                    |
| 51:50      | of things at the same time on my phone, I could, you know, do that through here.                         |
| 51:56      | But instead I have, you know, 7am, 8am.                                                                  |
| 51:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 52:00      | And like you would have the 7am shortcut would say, what is Timery, showing us the                       |
| 52:06      | current timer and if, just I guess I would do it on an if-then statement, and then you                   |
| 52:12      | would just run through all the typical watch faces and it would automatically set itself.                |
| 52:17      | We are such nerds.                                                                                       |
| 52:19      | Also, shortcuts team, if you want to add a switch case to shortcuts and add the ability                  |
| 52:26      | to run every hour or every x interval, then it would be perfect, because then I could                    |
| 52:31      | say add 07, do this, add 08, do that, and that is the perfect use case for a switch                      |
| 52:37      | case instead of lots and lots of if statements.                                                          |
| 52:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 52:40      | No, agreed.                                                                                              |
| 52:41      | Agreed.                                                                                                  |
| 52:42      | And there's just no way to do that currently, because the way these automatic triggers work,             |
| 52:48      | there's no way to do that except make a separate one for every hour, you know, that gets crazy.          |
| 52:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 52:54      | That's one of the reasons why Push Cut Automation Server is still saving the day for me, because         |
| 52:58      | I have it run some stuff like on an hourly interval, some stuff's running on a 15 minute                 |
| 53:02      | interval, and I'm just running it all on Push Cut Automation Server because I can control                |
| 53:06      | it from my phone, but then my phone's not doing whatever every so often.                                 |
| 53:10      | So the more I think about the more, I think the way I would probably implement this would                |
| 53:14      | be to actually just make shortcuts to launch timers and put the watch change in.                         |
| 53:20      | That's just the easiest way.                                                                             |
| 53:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 53:23      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 53:24      | Thanks for having me.                                                                                    |
| 53:25      | I have a homework assignment.                                                                            |
| 53:26      | Thank you for that, Rose.                                                                                |
| 53:27      | Yes, you do.                                                                                             |
| 53:28      | In addition to being able to change watch faces, we also have the ability to trigger shortcuts           |
| 53:32      | from the watch, and this was something we had with the old workflow app, and I always                    |
| 53:37      | kind of missed that it went away, but you can assign shortcuts to your watch and just                    |
| 53:43      | open up the shortcuts app on your watch and trigger them.                                                |
| 53:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 53:48      | The question becomes, what do you really want to trigger from your watch?                                |
| 53:52      | I mean, Apple Watch Automations for me was the first one where I can have it change the                  |
| 53:58      | face to this and mute.                                                                                   |
| 54:00      | My watch spends most of its time on mute, but every so often I'll unmute it.                             |
| 54:03      | And so being able to make sure it's muted is great.                                                      |
| 54:07      | And so I started with experimenting with that, and a lot of the change face automations,                 |
| 54:14      | I've actually just got as individual shortcuts, which sounds kind of crazy, but it then means            |
| 54:18      | that I know that this one is the automator's face and this one is the nested folder's face               |
| 54:23      | and so on.                                                                                               |
| 54:24      | And because that's integrated into multiple ones, if I want to change my watch, like which               |
| 54:27      | watch face is the automator's face, I can now do that really easily.                                     |
| 54:31      | So I'm really glad in hindsight that I set that up.                                                      |
| 54:34      | So that's great.                                                                                         |
| 54:36      | It sounds crazy when you can just swipe between the faces, but if you have a lot of faces,               |
| 54:41      | especially if you've got different faces or different types of contexts, this actually                   |
| 54:46      | might be faster.                                                                                         |
| 54:47      | For me, it's more a case of, yes, this is definitely the face I want, and it'll also                     |
| 54:52      | do things like toggle the lights in my office and stuff like that if necessary, because                  |
| 54:56      | it can pull in the daylight or the light levels from my Hue sensor.                                      |
| 55:01      | I've done some home automation stuff with it, I feel like, because there's a [[HomeKit]]                     |
| 55:05      | app on the watch, but it's work, you know, you hit the [[HomeKit]], then you've got to press                 |
| 55:09      | the button and kind of get through to it.                                                                |
| 55:11      | And I know they made that better in iOS 14 too for the watch, but I do like the idea                     |
| 55:15      | of having complete control of that myself.                                                               |
| 55:18      | And making [[HomeKit]] based shortcuts is, I think, a good use for the watch app.                            |
| 55:24      | But I'm struggling to really find a lot of use cases for shortcuts off the watch.                        |
| 55:30      | I mean, so much of the stuff I do with shortcuts needs a screen for me to interact with it.              |
| 55:35      | But you know, I'm playing with it.                                                                       |
| 55:36      | If I'm going to move timers into shortcuts, I may experiment with that on the watch.                     |
| 55:40      | Have you done any of that?                                                                               |
| 55:42      | I've done a little bit of it.                                                                            |
| 55:43      | It seems to work really well, but I don't know if it's working just because my phone                     |
| 55:49      | is right next to my watch, and it's doing things through that.                                           |
| 55:52      | I've had some interesting experiences with stuff going, hey, that's not possible on the                  |
| 55:55      | Apple Watch.                                                                                             |
| 55:56      | At the moment, the run shortcut action does appear to be broken on Apple Watch, which                    |
| 56:00      | is a shame.                                                                                              |
| 56:01      | But fortunately, I wasn't really using that on my watch, which is good.                                  |
| 56:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 56:06      | But I do use that one in a lot of shortcuts.                                                             |
| 56:08      | So there's a bunch of things that just won't work on the watch, but it's there now.                      |
| 56:13      | And I feel like they've planted their flag and it's going to get better.                                 |
| 56:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 56:17      | I have to say, I am still using push cut on my Apple Watch quite a bit because I can,                    |
| 56:24      | or rather I'm using it through shortcuts on my Apple Watch, because then I can say, hey,                 |
| 56:28      | go and do this thing.                                                                                    |
| 56:29      | And it's something that needs a phone, but it doesn't necessarily need me at the phone                   |
| 56:33      | to do it.                                                                                                |
| 56:34      | So for example, I can say, hey, can you go and double check that all of the [[Drafts]] are                   |
| 56:38      | created for the ScreenCast online show that I'm making, and it will just go and do that                  |
| 56:42      | and dump it into [[Drafts]].                                                                                 |
| 56:43      | And then because iCloud sync, it works.                                                                  |
| 56:46      | And it's on whatever device I then pick up when I get to it in a few minutes.                            |
| 56:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 56:52      | What are some other examples of uses for push cut that you're using these days?                          |
| 56:57      | Well, for example, whenever automators show notes are created, I have it.                                |
| 57:03      | So that's done by a combination of Integra, Met, and Zapier, because I started changing                  |
| 57:10      | things on Zapier and then realised that I needed to trigger it in a different way.                       |
| 57:14      | And so I decided just to use Integra, Met to do that, which is, you know, it sounds                      |
| 57:18      | more complex than it is, and it's definitely more Rube Goldberg machine than is necessary                |
| 57:23      | for the vast majority of people.                                                                         |
| 57:25      | But whenever these show notes are actually created, then it pings my push cut for me                     |
| 57:31      | on all of my devices and goes, hey, the show notes for this show were created.                           |
| 57:36      | Here's a link.                                                                                           |
| 57:37      | So that I can just tap on it and it opens straight to Google Docs and I'm in and I can                   |
| 57:42      | go do it because, you know, if I'm creating stuff, I want to be able to just jump right                  |
| 57:45      | into it and do it.                                                                                       |
| 57:47      | A somewhat related note, IFTTT has a pro version now, where you can actually do multiple steps           |
| 57:54      | and do all the things we've complained about that it couldn't do for so long.                            |
| 57:58      | We are planning a future show roundup, Rose and I are both playing with it, that's coming.               |
| 58:03      | And if you have not signed up for it yet, I believe before, at some point in October,                    |
| 58:09      | it's going to change it right now, you can choose your own price.                                        |
| 58:11      | So if you're interested in that, go sign up for it now.                                                  |
| 58:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 58:15      | And they're locking that price in for a very long time right now.                                        |
| 58:18      | To start with, it was just for the first year, but now I believe they're saying until or                 |
| 58:23      | indefinitely that they're locking it into that price.                                                    |
| 58:26      | So if you think that you're going to want it in a couple of months, it might be worth                    |
| 58:29      | signing up on one of the cheaper, I believe they recommend $3.99, $6.99 and $9.99 is the                 |
| 58:36      | prices, but you can set your own price from $1.99 a month.                                               |
| 58:40      | We are sponsored this week by Sidequest.                                                                 |
| 58:43      | Sidequest is a new task tracking app for [[Slack]] that combines the reliability of traditional              |
| 58:47      | ticketing systems and the ease of use of modern to-do apps 100% inside your [[Slack]] workspace.             |
| 58:54      | It allows your team members to create tasks in personal task inboxes or in channels so                   |
| 58:58      | you can work on them as a team.                                                                          |
| 59:01      | As soon as the task has been created, Sidequest turns it into a single point of truth, so                |
| 59:05      | you always have a shared understanding of the task at hand, its history and its status.                  |
| 59:11      | Sidequest is great for transparently managing these little tasks that simply don't seem                  |
| 59:14      | to fit anywhere else, but it also shines when it comes to powering entire [[Slack]] base help                |
| 59:19      | this, both for larger teams or even external clients.                                                    |
| 59:23      | Sidequest was released just a month ago, but is already loved by hundreds of teams around                |
| 59:27      | the world, and is currently being featured as one of the top three apps in the [[Slack]]                     |
| 59:32      | app directory.                                                                                           |

| 01:00:08   | Our thanks to Sidequest for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                              |
| 01:00:12   | All right, Rose, there's also some stuff going on under the hood with the new shortcuts.                 |
| 01:00:20   | And as I understand it, it's going to be much easier for developers to make more complex                 |
| 01:00:27   | actions.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:28   | Have you seen that?                                                                                      |
| 01:00:29   | I haven't really seen that implemented much yet.                                                         |
| 01:00:32   | I haven't, but what I am seeing implemented are these automation suggestions, which I                    |
| 01:00:37   | think are a sign of amazing things to come.                                                              |
| 01:00:40   | Now right now, all of my automation suggestions, so you can find these in shortcuts at the               |
| 01:00:45   | bottom, you've got my shortcuts, automation tab, and then you've got the gallery.                        |
| 01:00:48   | If you look in the gallery, then as well as shortcuts from your apps, which was there                    |
| 01:00:52   | in iOS 13, above that, there's automation suggestions.                                                   |
| 01:00:56   | All of mine right now seem to be time related, but I'm really hoping that we're going to                 |
| 01:01:00   | see a lot more of these come out of the woodwork soon.                                                   |
| 01:01:06   | Because I think that that is a sign, especially if they link that to like, hey, you've arrived           |
| 01:01:11   | at this location.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:12   | I see that you usually open this app at this location.                                                   |
| 01:01:15   | I distinctly remember, I think it was on Twitter, somebody was saying that whenever they were            |
| 01:01:20   | at a specific Starbucks, they always checked a specific draft in [[Drafts]] for the code to                  |
| 01:01:25   | use the bathroom.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:28   | They noticed it was starting to show up whenever they hit that particular Starbucks because              |
| 01:01:32   | they needed the code.                                                                                    |
| 01:01:34   | I thought that was brilliant.                                                                            |
| 01:01:36   | I love that app developers have that.                                                                    |
| 01:01:38   | I would love to see shortcuts that can run based on that and shortcuts picking up on                     |
| 01:01:44   | that because that's pretty impressive.                                                                   |
| 01:01:46   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:47   | I believe that's all done on device.                                                                     |
| 01:01:49   | There's no cloud sharing, so respect your privacy.                                                         |
| 01:01:54   | Because it's done on device, I would think that so long as the developers have the framework             |
| 01:01:58   | that their apps could be just as smart.                                                                  |
| 01:02:01   | Well, it is if [[Drafts]] is doing it because [[Drafts]] is a third-party app.                                   |
| 01:02:05   | Exactly.                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:06   | I know that Agile Tortoise is extremely automation-friendly.                                             |
| 01:02:11   | That's why we love [[Drafts]] so much.                                                                       |
| 01:02:13   | But there are other app developers doing this stuff as well, so it'd be great to see all                 |
| 01:02:18   | of that come into effect.                                                                                |
| 01:02:20   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:02:21   | We got a lot of presence this year for shortcuts.                                                        |
| 01:02:25   | What's left on your list?                                                                                |
| 01:02:27   | I want shortcut history, not necessarily versioning, though versioning would be very helpful where       |
| 01:02:33   | it would save different versions of your shortcuts so that you could revert back to them if you          |
| 01:02:37   | wanted to, kind of like Time Machine does.                                                               |
| 01:02:40   | I would really like to be able to find out when was this shortcut last run and what was                  |
| 01:02:45   | the output of the shortcut.                                                                              |
| 01:02:46   | How often have I run this shortcut?                                                                      |
| 01:02:48   | When did I create this shortcut?                                                                         |
| 01:02:51   | I would love these to be accessible to shortcuts, like all of these little tidbits, because              |
| 01:02:55   | then I could find which shortcuts I use the most frequently.                                             |
| 01:02:59   | Shortcuts that I've used in the last month or shortcuts I haven't used in the last month.                |
| 01:03:03   | All of that sort of thing.                                                                               |
| 01:03:05   | That would be great because I have 954 shortcuts.                                                        |
| 01:03:09   | I would hazard a guess that I probably only use a hundred of them, but I have no idea                    |
| 01:03:14   | which 100 they are.                                                                                      |
| 01:03:18   | At the moment, I'm just sort of sitting around waiting, trying to figure all this out.                   |
| 01:03:23   | I've tried some things using [[Data Jar]] and other things to lock this info, but I'm then having             |
| 01:03:30   | to build it into every single shortcut, and yeah, I'm not particularly happy with that.                  |
| 01:03:36   | I want the dust to settle this year, I understand that app developers can put more power into            |
| 01:03:41   | the shortcut.                                                                                            |
| 01:03:42   | I want to see what happens.                                                                              |
| 01:03:44   | I feel like Apple has done a good job with shortcuts of making simple shortcuts that                     |
| 01:03:49   | do simple things, like at 10 o'clock change my watch face.                                               |
| 01:03:53   | I would like to see them expand towards the upper end to the power user end, and I believe               |
| 01:03:59   | they can do that without compromising the lower end, the simple end.                                     |
| 01:04:04   | I would like to see better UI elements.                                                                  |
| 01:04:08   | Let us be more like app developers and build our shortcuts to look pretty, and I know there's            |
| 01:04:15   | third-party apps that kind of help with that, but it really needs to come from Apple, and                |
| 01:04:20   | I would just like to see it become, I'd like to see them go even further.                                |
| 01:04:25   | I don't think it happens overnight.                                                                      |
| 01:04:27   | I actually think that I have a lot of respect for all the work the shortcut scene has done.              |
| 01:04:30   | I think that in a company like Apple, when you look how far they've come in just a couple                |
| 01:04:34   | of years, I'm actually really impressed.                                                                 |
| 01:04:37   | Oh yeah, me too.                                                                                         |
| 01:04:38   | If you listen to me, I seem to whine a lot, but it's because they've done such a good                    |
| 01:04:43   | job, I just keep wanting more.                                                                           |
| 01:04:45   | Yeah, me too, definitely.                                                                                |
| 01:04:47   | I'm genuinely really impressed at everything the shortcuts developers have put out, both                 |
| 01:04:52   | back when it was workflow and then after they moved to Apple and all of this stuff.                      |
| 01:04:57   | Last year, they barely got any screen time in [[WWDC]], there were just a few sort of foot                   |
| 01:05:03   | notes almost, and we got automations.                                                                    |
| 01:05:06   | That's incredible, and this year we've got even more powerful automations because they're                |
| 01:05:11   | automatic automations, as you call them, David, so I'm really pleased to see all of that stuff.          |
| 01:05:16   | All right.                                                                                               |
| 01:05:17   | Now, I went in this most recent episode of Mac Power users, Steve and I went into great                  |
| 01:05:21   | length into our iOS home screens and how we're implementing widgets.                                     |
| 01:05:26   | I have to know how Rosemary Orchard is doing it.                                                         |
| 01:05:30   | What have you done, Rose?                                                                                |
| 01:05:31   | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:32   | To start with, there was a feature I discovered very recently where if you tap and hold on               |
| 01:05:37   | your home screen to edit it, and then tap on the pages indicator, you can hide pages.                    |
| 01:05:42   | To start with, I did that and I now have a travel page where I have some travel-related                  |
| 01:05:49   | widgets and all the travel apps.                                                                         |
| 01:05:52   | That's what I did there.                                                                                 |
| 01:05:53   | So, you can hide pages with widgets on them, so you only see those when you travel.                      |
| 01:05:57   | Smart.                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:58   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:59   | So, I can just unhide it, which is great.                                                                |
| 01:06:00   | So, actually, the travel page would be the second page on my iPhone, only most of the                    |
| 01:06:04   | time I'm not traveling, but when I am traveling, I will need access to it.                               |
| 01:06:09   | And then on the home screen of my iPhone, I currently only have two widgets.                             |
| 01:06:13   | I have a small widget in the top right, and then a medium widget immediately below that.                 |
| 01:06:18   | So, I've got four apps in the top left, widget top right, then widget covering two rows,                 |
| 01:06:23   | and then two rows of apps, and then my doc.                                                              |
| 01:06:25   | Top right, I have colour widgets, series suggestions, because it's always interesting seeing what         |
| 01:06:31   | that throws up, pedometer plus plus, Timery, music, and batteries.                                       |
| 01:06:39   | And then in the bigger widget, I have a carrot, specifically the snark widget, because who               |
| 01:06:44   | doesn't love a little bit of snark, apparently some clouds up there are good clouds right                |
| 01:06:49   | now.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:50   | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:51   | Then I'm playing with launcher, because I've got some hot buttons to message certain people.             |
| 01:06:54   | Yes, you're one of them, David, and a hot button to play a specific, very large playlist                 |
| 01:06:59   | that I have.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:01   | Then I have two shortcuts, widgets after another, Fantastical, [[Dark Noise]], and [[Drafts]].                   |
| 01:07:09   | Okay, so are the shortcut widgets the medium or the large ones?                                          |
| 01:07:13   | The medium ones.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:14   | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:15   | So, I've only got four in there, but I've got two sets of four, so I'm kind of cheating,                 |
| 01:07:19   | but not much.                                                                                            |
| 01:07:20   | Good.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:21   | Well, you're loaded.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:22   | Are you okay if we share some of the pictures with the...                                                |
| 01:07:26   | Yeah, yeah, I will take a screenshot.                                                                    |
| 01:07:29   | The problem is taking a screenshot of everything that's actually in the stack.                           |
| 01:07:35   | Wait, if I edit the stack, I could take a screenshot of that and show people what's in the stack.        |
| 01:07:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:43   | So, I've done, and I'll share mine as well here, but it's also over on Mac Power Users,                  |
| 01:07:47   | but on the home screen, I have the large Fantastical view that has both the calendar month and           |
| 01:07:56   | then the upcoming appointments on it, and then below that, the medium-sized widget for                   |
| 01:08:02   | shortcuts with those big four that I talked about during the show.                                       |
| 01:08:05   | So, I don't have any apps on my home screen except in the dock at this point.                            |
| 01:08:09   | Wow.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:11   | So, I would try that, but I'm not 100% sure about it yet.                                                |
| 01:08:14   | Yeah, and then I just flip over to App Switcher on the next screen, so I've really kind of               |
| 01:08:18   | gone all in with this, and I'll be curious to see where I'm at six months, but I'm pretty                |
| 01:08:22   | happy with it as it is.                                                                                  |
| 01:08:24   | Yeah, I've been experimenting a little bit with some other apps, Widgetsmith, definitely                 |
| 01:08:30   | one of them.                                                                                             |
| 01:08:31   | That's on my second screen right now, but there's also Color Widgets and WidgetPack, and WidgetPack        |
| 01:08:39   | is particularly interesting to automators listeners because it's updated by shortcuts.                   |
| 01:08:44   | So, for example, I have NASA photo of the day, and it does that through shortcuts, where                 |
| 01:08:54   | it gets the astronomy photo of the day for you, and like countdowns to things, and it                    |
| 01:08:59   | can do a shortcuts grid of nine shortcuts in that space, which I'm still considering.                    |
| 01:09:05   | I kind of like the idea, but I'm not 100% sold on it yet, where you can do all of that,                  |
| 01:09:13   | and I'm finding it really interesting.                                                                   |
| 01:09:14   | I want to see what new apps we get this year with iOS 14 from developers making stuff for                |
| 01:09:19   | shortcuts.                                                                                               |
| 01:09:20   | Yeah, it's like an explosion of widget apps right now, and between now and the time we                   |
| 01:09:25   | record the next show, there'll probably be 10 more, at least, and it'll be 10 more contenders,           |
| 01:09:32   | but it'll be fun to see how all this plays out, and it's also cool to see that non-power                 |
| 01:09:41   | users are getting into these widgets and using them to decorate their home screens and do                |
| 01:09:46   | all this cool stuff.                                                                                     |
| 01:09:47   | So, I'm looking forward to see how this all plays out.                                                   |
| 01:09:49   | Me too.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:50   | All right, that does it for this episode.                                                                |
| 01:09:53   | If you are using the new shortcuts in fun and interesting ways, you should probably go                   |
| 01:09:57   | over to the Automators forums or was it talk.automators.fm.                                              |

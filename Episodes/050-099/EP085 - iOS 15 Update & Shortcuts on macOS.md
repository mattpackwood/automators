| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators,                                   |
| 00:04      | the show where we talk about how to get                            |
| 00:05      | your technology to do your work for you and                        |
| 00:07      | tell you about all of those important things.                      |
| 00:09      | I'm Rosemary Orchard, and as always,                               |
| 00:10      | I'm joined by my co-host, David Sparks.                            |
| 00:12      | Hey, David, how are you today?                                     |
| 00:13      | I am great, Rose.                                                  |
| 00:15      | It is so nice talking to you.                                      |
| 00:17      | It is. I was on holiday for a bit,                                 |
| 00:19      | so our listeners didn't miss out on an episode,                    |
| 00:21      | but we missed out on talking to each other for a bit,              |
| 00:23      | which is a shame.                                                  |
| 00:23      | Yeah. I mean, so much has happened.                                |
| 00:25      | We've had Apple events,                                            |
| 00:26      | and iOS releases, and a lot of this stuff                          |
| 00:31      | does impact automation,                                            |
| 00:32      | so we've got a kind of a smorgasbord of automation today.          |
| 00:37      | Yeah. I feel like we should start with the Apple event,            |
| 00:40      | because while the new devices themselves                           |
| 00:42      | don't necessarily make any significant changes to our automations, |
| 00:45      | they're shiny and new,                                             |
| 00:46      | and it's fun to talk about them for a couple of minutes,           |
| 00:49      | because everybody's going to be curious as to what we got.         |
| 00:52      | I think people might be able to guess what I got,                  |
| 00:56      | but David, what did you get?                                       |
| 00:58      | I ordered a new iPhone.                                            |
| 01:00      | That's what I've done so far.                                      |
| 01:03      | I am interested in that new iPad mini.                             |
| 01:07      | I have an aged iPad mini that I keep in my bedside table,          |
| 01:11      | and I know [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] ordered a new iPad mini,                        |
| 01:14      | and all the cool kids are ordering iPad minis,                     |
| 01:16      | and I'm going to find out.                                         |
| 01:18      | I just haven't got a round to it.                                  |
| 01:18      | I want to see what the trading value is of my existing one,        |
| 01:23      | because to be fair, the one I have does what I need,               |
| 01:27      | Instapaper, Kindle.                                                |
| 01:31      | I mean, I do a lot of reading on it,                               |
| 01:32      | but I don't know, maybe I could do more with one,                  |
| 01:35      | and I really like that new design language.                        |
| 01:39      | I really like that it works with the new Apple Pencil,             |
| 01:42      | so I'm very tempted by that.                                       |
| 01:44      | Yes.                                                               |
| 01:45      | How about you?                                                     |
| 01:47      | People will not be surprised to find out                           |
| 01:48      | that I have ordered a purple iPad mini.                            |
| 01:51      | Of course.                                                         |
| 01:52      | First of all, it's purple.                                         |
| 01:53      | How could I not?                                                   |
| 01:54      | Secondly, I have the last gen iPad mini,                           |
| 01:58      | and it's wonderful in many respects.                               |
| 01:59      | It is a perfectly sized handbag device for me.                     |
| 02:02      | It fits in all but two of my smallest handbags,                    |
| 02:06      | and those two smallest handbags barely fit a Pro Max iPhone,       |
| 02:09      | just barely.                                                       |
| 02:11      | So it's not a surprise that the iPad mini doesn't fit in there,    |
| 02:13      | and quite frankly, if I'm using those handbags,                    |
| 02:14      | it's because I'm going somewhere fancy,                            |
| 02:15      | which hasn't happened in two years,                                |
| 02:17      | but that's beside the point.                                       |
| 02:19      | So I've ordered that and I went with the English Lavender case,    |
| 02:24      | because it's purple.                                               |
| 02:26      | It's English and it's lavender.                                    |
| 02:28      | Oh, yeah, and it's a lovely colour.                                 |
| 02:30      | But the iPhone doesn't come in purple,                             |
| 02:33      | because in the middle of this year,                                |
| 02:34      | I actually switched to an iPhone mini                              |
| 02:35      | when they came out with the purple one,                            |
| 02:37      | because I couldn't resist.                                         |
| 02:38      | And it turns out I love the mini iPhone,                           |
| 02:41      | but I don't love the new colours enough to not go pro,              |
| 02:45      | especially with the camera,                                        |
| 02:46      | because I've really missed having that zoom lens on the camera,    |
| 02:49      | the telephoto, and especially optical image stabilisation          |
| 02:53      | on all the lenses and so on.                                       |
| 02:55      | I just, yeah, I went pro this year,                                |
| 02:58      | but I did not go Pro Max.                                          |
| 03:00      | That was a mistake last year.                                      |
| 03:02      | But as we'll find out later in the show,                           |
| 03:03      | that Pro Max was not entirely a mistake.                           |
| 03:06      | There's a usage for it coming up.                                  |
| 03:08      | Oh, so you got the big one and now you want the small one?         |
| 03:12      | Yeah, yeah, so I, yeah,                                            |
| 03:14      | because I had the regular 11 Pro,                                  |
| 03:17      | and that was great, and I liked it,                                |
| 03:19      | but it was a little too big.                                       |
| 03:21      | And it turns out the [[MagSafe]] PopSocket,                            |
| 03:23      | actually I love [[MagSafe]],                                           |
| 03:24      | [[MagSafe]] is amazing at being able to                                |
| 03:26      | [[MagSafe]] a PopSocket on there,                                      |
| 03:27      | and then pop it off and throw a wallet on there,                   |
| 03:30      | or pop it off and chuck it on a charger.                           |
| 03:32      | That works really, really well for me,                             |
| 03:34      | and I really like that.                                            |
| 03:36      | And [[MagSafe]] is brilliant, basically.                               |
| 03:38      | It's not the cheapest technology for all these things,             |
| 03:41      | but the PopSocket makes holding a phone much easier.               |
| 03:44      | And so I think I'm gonna be fine with the 13 Pro,                  |
| 03:48      | not Max, in Sierra Blue, because it's a lovely blue.               |
| 03:51      | That is a very pretty colour.                                       |
| 03:54      | I usually, first of all, I want a second.                          |
| 03:57      | Everything you said about PopSocket,                               |
| 04:00      | we're just [[MagSafe]] in general.                                     |
| 04:01      | I have the [[MagSafe]] PopSocket, the [[MagSafe]] wallet,                  |
| 04:05      | the [[MagSafe]] case, and the [[MagSafe]] battery.                         |
| 04:07      | So I am all in with it,                                            |
| 04:09      | and I really like just sticking things on my phone.                |
| 04:12      | And the PopSocket, I was skeptical about it.                       |
| 04:15      | I bought it with the intention that I may have to return it,       |
| 04:18      | and it, no, it's great.                                            |
| 04:19      | It really sticks on there good.                                    |
| 04:21      | Yeah, I think it's the strongest magnet                            |
| 04:24      | out of all the [[MagSafe]] magnets that I have.                        |
| 04:27      | It is incredibly strong, and it's brilliant.                       |
| 04:30      | Something I've also noticed is if you have a [[MagSafe]] case on,      |
| 04:35      | other devices stick to the [[MagSafe]] case                            |
| 04:37      | better than they stick to the phone itself.                        |
| 04:39      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 04:40      | I don't know if there's like a force multiplier with magnets,      |
| 04:43      | or it's just the texture of the case gives it a better grip.       |
| 04:47      | And as silicon cases definitely stick much better                  |
| 04:49      | than leather cases, that said,                                     |
| 04:52      | there is a wisteria leather case,                                  |
| 04:55      | which is kind of a purplish lavender-y blue.                       |
| 04:57      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 04:58      | And yeah, that's apparently coming tomorrow                        |
| 05:02      | as we record this episode.                                         |
| 05:03      | I don't have the silicon.                                          |
| 05:04      | I have the leather case, I have the orange one                     |
| 05:06      | from the iPhone 12.                                                |
| 05:08      | As we record this,                                                 |
| 05:10      | when the show releases, it's actually iPhone day,                  |
| 05:13      | but we're recording this even before the reviews come out.         |
| 05:16      | So I bought the Pro Max again.                                     |
| 05:22      | Usually I go through this self-flatulation every time I,           |
| 05:27      | wait, I don't think I said that right.                             |
| 05:29      | Isn't it flatulation, just farting?                                |
| 05:31      | Yes, flagellation.                                                 |
| 05:32      | Okay, so that was not what I wanted to say.                        |
| 05:36      | Flagellation, oh boy.                                              |
| 05:37      | I'm just digging deeper.                                           |
| 05:39      | I don't know, yeah, I'm Googling it.                               |
| 05:42      | David, we're good.                                                 |
| 05:43      | I beat myself up every year.                                       |
| 05:45      | How's that?                                                        |
| 05:46      | Over like, do I get the big one?                                   |
| 05:47      | Do I get the little one, blah, blah.                               |
| 05:49      | This year it just came to me,                                      |
| 05:50      | because last year I got the big white one                          |
| 05:52      | and I got the big white one again.                                 |
| 05:53      | I like the colour of it.                                            |
| 05:55      | I like the white because I really like the silver bands            |
| 05:58      | on the side, the sky blue tempted me,                              |
| 06:00      | but I don't want coloured bands                                     |
| 06:02      | because I want to be able to use it with any case                  |
| 06:04      | without having to think about it too much.                         |
| 06:06      | And I keep my phone out of the case a lot                          |
| 06:09      | when I'm just around the house,                                    |
| 06:10      | but whenever I leave the house, I put it in a case                 |
| 06:12      | and I just got the exact same phone basically.                     |
| 06:16      | And I can't wait to get it.                                        |
| 06:18      | We haven't got reviews yet, but that camera system,                |
| 06:21      | I am super into it.                                                |
| 06:23      | And I hope that it is as good as Apple says it is.                 |
| 06:27      | Yes, yeah, I'm very much looking forward to this.                  |
| 06:31      | The cinematic mode, I think is gonna be really fun                 |
| 06:34      | for recording some stuff.                                          |
| 06:35      | I've had so much fun with centre stage                             |
| 06:37      | with friends on Zoom calls.                                        |
| 06:40      | We've been trying it out and it's great.                           |
| 06:42      | I walk out of shop to go grab a glass of water                     |
| 06:44      | and I walk back in and it like captures me                         |
| 06:47      | and zooms in on me dramatically                                    |
| 06:48      | as I'm walking back to the iPad with a glass of water.             |
| 06:51      | It's so much fun that then I go out                                |
| 06:53      | and grab a snack and then come back                                |
| 06:55      | and I've been eating way too many snacks basically                 |
| 06:57      | as the short end of that story.                                    |
| 06:59      | But it's really good fun.                                          |
| 07:01      | I'm so glad the iPad mini has that as well                         |
| 07:03      | because centre stage really is just a nice feature                 |
| 07:06      | because you really are focused on the iPad.                        |
| 07:10      | And then the Apple Watch isn't out yet,                            |
| 07:12      | but has a decision been made?                                      |
| 07:15      | Yes, I unfortunately have had a couple of minor incidents          |
| 07:19      | with my Apple Watch over the last year                             |
| 07:20      | and the face on this one is scratched.                             |
| 07:23      | So I'm upgrading to a series seven                                 |
| 07:26      | and I'm gonna get stylised.                                        |
| 07:28      | But the main reason for the upgrade                                |
| 07:30      | aside from the scratches is I'm gonna go cellular                  |
| 07:32      | for the very first time                                            |
| 07:34      | because I'm excited by the idea of it.                             |
| 07:37      | I'm switching carriers here in the UK anyway                       |
| 07:40      | just because my current carrier                                    |
| 07:42      | doesn't have great signal where I live                             |
| 07:46      | and there are other carriers with better signal.                   |
| 07:48      | So I'm gonna be paying a bit more money                            |
| 07:49      | and I thought let's pay all the more money                         |
| 07:52      | and get a cellular Apple Watch as well                             |
| 07:54      | because there are times when I have gone out                       |
| 07:56      | and I've forgotten my phone at home.                               |
| 07:58      | It doesn't usually happen, but it does happen at times             |
| 08:01      | and also just being able to leave my phone at home                 |
| 08:04      | and go for a jog or something without my phone                     |
| 08:07      | but still having a way to make a call if I need to                 |
| 08:11      | or reply to a message if I need to                                 |
| 08:13      | is gonna be really good.                                           |
| 08:14      | So I'm looking forward to trying that for the very first time.     |
| 08:18      | Yeah, I am too also interested in the new watch.                   |
| 08:21      | I've got a series five.                                            |
| 08:22      | So I feel like I'd like to get the feature                         |
| 08:25      | that stands out the most to me is brighter, always on.             |
| 08:29      | The series five is always on                                       |
| 08:31      | but it's actually pretty dark.                                     |
| 08:32      | Sometimes it's kind of hard to read it.                            |
| 08:34      | But I also expect we're gonna hear about M1X Max soon              |
| 08:40      | and that is something I'm definitely going to want                 |
| 08:42      | to spend money on and I'm kind of at that expensive point          |
| 08:45      | in my life, the kids, two kids in college, blah, blah, blah.       |
| 08:48      | So we'll see what I actually end up buying                         |
| 08:50      | but I definitely got a phone                                       |
| 08:51      | and I will probably be definitely buying an M1X Mac mini           |
| 08:55      | if those come out and everything else is, it's in play.            |
| 08:59      | Let's say that.                                                    |
| 09:01      | Yeah, I am incredibly happy with my M1iMac.                        |
| 09:05      | I love it.                                                         |
| 09:06      | This thing is silent.                                              |
| 09:08      | It is fast.                                                        |
| 09:09      | It is insanely fast and it's brilliant.                            |
| 09:11      | And I got an M1 MacBook Pro as well                                |
| 09:14      | because I needed a machine I could install Monterey on             |
| 09:16      | that was gonna have all of the features.                           |
| 09:18      | And so I went M1 for that.                                         |
| 09:20      | I took it on holiday with me and it was great.                     |
| 09:22      | I was building apps in [[Xcode]]                                       |
| 09:25      | and uploading them to the App Store.                               |
| 09:27      | As this episode releases, by the way,                              |
| 09:30      | there is still a chance if you have not done so already            |
| 09:33      | to donate to the Relay FM for St. Jude campaign                    |
| 09:36      | at stjude.org slash relay.                                         |
| 09:38      | So if you haven't done that,                                       |
| 09:40      | there's links in the show notes to all the details.                |
| 09:42      | You should do that.                                                |
| 09:43      | But some friends of mine built an app                              |
| 09:44      | which is basically just a widget to track the campaign             |
| 09:48      | and I have an App Store account.                                   |
| 09:50      | So I hosted it and it's just a [[TestFlight]] application             |
| 09:53      | but I was able to do builds for that                               |
| 09:55      | and another app that they then decided to build                    |
| 09:57      | while I was on holiday really quickly on the M1.                   |
| 10:01      | And it was brilliant because most of the time                      |
| 10:03      | was occupied by searching for wifi                                 |
| 10:06      | and trying to upload the app to the App Store after that.          |
| 10:08      | But being able to do the build incredibly quickly                  |
| 10:10      | meant that things were considerably less painful                   |
| 10:13      | than they would have been on an Intel machine.                     |
| 10:14      | And that was really good.                                          |
| 10:16      | We got all excited about Apple gear and automation.                |
| 10:18      | We didn't talk about that.                                         |
| 10:19      | And it's been an amazing year.                                     |
| 10:21      | They've raised $500,000 this year,                                 |
| 10:23      | a million dollars total over the kind of run                       |
| 10:26      | of these podcasts-athons.                                          |
| 10:28      | And I just don't know what to say,                                 |
| 10:31      | that there's not much we do on this show more important            |
| 10:35      | than helping cure kids of cancer.                                  |
| 10:38      | So I mean, I can't think of anything better                        |
| 10:40      | and whether you have-                                              |
| 10:41      | The one thing I will say,                                          |
| 10:43      | which is worth everybody hearing is also                           |
| 10:45      | St. Jude does all of this research                                 |
| 10:47      | and they share it for free around the world.                       |
| 10:50      | Which a lot of research is kept private                            |
| 10:53      | so that companies can make money off of it.                        |
| 10:56      | And St. Jude doesn't do that.                                      |
| 10:57      | If it helps kill cancer,                                           |
| 10:58      | they want to share it with the world.                              |
| 11:01      | So that's pretty awesome.                                          |
| 11:04      | So many scientists are so possessive of their research             |
| 11:07      | and St. Jude just puts it out there.                               |
| 11:09      | And also, just like I understand                                   |
| 11:12      | that times are tough right now.                                    |
| 11:14      | A lot of folks lost jobs and things.                               |
| 11:16      | We're dealing with that in my house.                               |
| 11:17      | My wife lost her job.                                              |
| 11:19      | But at the same time,                                              |
| 11:20      | even if you just have $5, it helps.                                |
| 11:23      | And there's a lot of people who listen to this show.               |
| 11:24      | So anyway, just think about it.                                    |
| 11:26      | We'd appreciate it if you'd help out.                              |
| 11:28      | If you have donated, man, thank you.                               |
| 11:30      | You're the reason we were able to get                              |
| 11:32      | to that $500,000 number and we really appreciate it.               |
| 11:35      | All that's in the show notes, so check it out.                     |
| 11:38      | One other thing, speaking of spending money,                       |
| 11:41      | Rose, I made a new field guide.                                    |
| 11:42      | You did.                                                           |
| 11:44      | And David, you knocked it out of the park again.                   |
| 11:46      | I'm reworking my entire Devon Think setup.                         |
| 11:49      | Thank you for all of the extra work                                |
| 11:51      | that you've created for me.                                        |
| 11:52      | Yeah, so I made the Devon Think field guide.                       |
| 11:54      | This is one of the most requested titles that I've had.            |
| 11:59      | I started it in April.                                             |
| 12:01      | It's got eight and a half hours of content,                        |
| 12:03      | but it's all broken down into small pieces                         |
| 12:05      | over a hundred videos.                                             |
| 12:06      | So you don't have to watch it all in one sitting.                  |
| 12:08      | And whether you've never touched Devon Think                       |
| 12:11      | or you're a pro user,                                              |
| 12:12      | I hope that you can get something out of it.                       |
| 12:14      | And it's on sale for a limited time.                               |
| 12:17      | When this episode publishes, it won't be much longer.              |
| 12:21      | So if you want to get that introductory price,                     |
| 12:24      | go over to learn.macsparkyi.com and check it out.                    |
| 12:27      | There is an automation angle to this                               |
| 12:29      | because there's a whole section in the video field guide           |
| 12:32      | because Devon Think, what I heard,                                 |
| 12:34      | because as I started working on this,                              |
| 12:36      | the field guide got to talk to the gang behind Devon Think.        |
| 12:39      | One of the main developers is super in automation.                 |
| 12:41      | And they basically kind of built a version of [[Hazel]]                |
| 12:45      | into it and they built a bunch of tools into Devon Think           |
| 12:48      | that make automation very good.                                    |
| 12:52      | Yes, yeah, they did.                                               |
| 12:54      | And I really, really love those tools.                             |
| 12:56      | In general, I find Devon Think                                     |
| 12:58      | to be a really useful tool for me because there's no more,         |
| 13:01      | did I store this in iCloud or Dropbox or whatever?                 |
| 13:05      | I just throw it in Devon Think and search there later.             |
| 13:07      | Now, one of the advantages you get with Devon Think                |
| 13:10      | is you get those links.                                            |
| 13:11      | I mean, the application creates links for every file.              |
| 13:15      | So for automators, that can be really handy                        |
| 13:17      | to be able to grab a link from any file                            |
| 13:20      | and just jump back to it.                                          |
| 13:22      | Either way, learn.macsparkyi.com for Devon Think field guide.        |
| 13:26      | And if you go to, is it relay.fm slash St. Jude?                   |
| 13:32      | I think that would get you there to donate to St. Jude.            |
| 13:35      | St. Jude.org slash relay will definitely get you there as well.    |
| 13:38      | I got it wrong, I got it wrong.                                    |
| 13:40      | It's okay, both of them work actually.                             |
| 13:42      | All right, great.                                                  |
| 13:43      | So anyway, back to buying stuff.                                   |
| 13:47      | I'm kind of sitting tight.                                         |
| 13:48      | Sounds like you're on your way.                                    |
| 13:50      | You're gonna have to tell us what you're doing                     |
| 13:52      | with that Mac mini,                                                |
| 13:53      | I'm sorry, the iPad mini in terms of automation.                   |
| 13:55      | Yeah, so the moment my current iPad mini                           |
| 13:58      | is the smallest amount of storage.                                 |
| 14:00      | I think it was 16 gigs.                                            |
| 14:02      | It's not cellular.                                                 |
| 14:03      | There's a bunch of handicaps to it,                                |
| 14:05      | which I didn't really think of when I bought it.                   |
| 14:08      | And I love it.                                                     |
| 14:09      | It's a great device.                                               |
| 14:10      | So it's gonna be given to my grandmother                           |
| 14:12      | because she constantly talks about wanting to upgrade her iPad     |
| 14:15      | but doesn't really have a real need to.                            |
| 14:18      | So I'll upgrade hers for her                                       |
| 14:20      | because that'll make her happy                                     |
| 14:21      | and happy grandmother is a good thing.                             |
| 14:24      | And then I'm going to use my lovely new purple.                    |
| 14:29      | It's more of a lilac, really.                                      |
| 14:31      | So the iPad mini as my on the go iPad slash notebook.              |
| 14:36      | Like a lot of people keep like a reporters notebook                |
| 14:39      | or something in their bag.                                         |
| 14:42      | And I prefer the iPad mini because I can take notes                |
| 14:45      | and they don't get screwed up corners and everything.              |
| 14:47      | And I use notability.                                              |
| 14:49      | It's brilliant.                                                    |
| 14:50      | And I also use it for sometimes                                    |
| 14:54      | wiggling away at my pocket cue.                                    |
| 14:55      | I also have a Kobo, which syncs with Pocket,                      |
| 14:58      | which is brilliant.                                                |
| 14:59      | So I prefer longer things to read on the Kobo,                     |
| 15:02      | but a lot of it is also just,                                      |
| 15:04      | it's a nice large convenient device                                |
| 15:07      | that you can have with you.                                        |
| 15:08      | And now it's got USB-C as well.                                    |
| 15:10      | It's a great device to just have in your bag                       |
| 15:12      | and just be able to pull out and go,                               |
| 15:14      | oh yeah, actually, there was this video I wanted to show you       |
| 15:16      | and it's big enough screen size                                    |
| 15:18      | that I can show my grandmother or my parents                       |
| 15:20      | or a friend the video.                                             |
| 15:22      | And they'll actually be able to see what I'm talking about         |
| 15:25      | instead of squinting at a phone,                                   |
| 15:27      | which especially with the mini iPhone has been problematic.        |
| 15:29      | But even with the Max, it's a fairly small screen                  |
| 15:32      | if somebody's trying to show somebody else something.              |
| 15:36      | Whereas with the mini, it's a bit easier.                          |
| 15:38      | All right, so something you said I wanna follow up on              |
| 15:40      | real quick is the note taking on an iPad.                          |
| 15:45      | And this is something we literally,                                |
| 15:47      | we just talked about this on Mac Power Users,                      |
| 15:49      | this show coming out this weekend,                                 |
| 15:51      | we're gonna cover it too.                                          |
| 15:51      | They had this new feature, Quick Note.                             |
| 15:54      | And the argument I made on Mac Power Users                         |
| 15:57      | is this is Apple's response to pad of paper and pencil.            |
| 16:00      | Like the historic problem is if I had a pad of paper               |
| 16:05      | and a pencil and I met you in a hallway                            |
| 16:07      | and you started telling me a phone number,                         |
| 16:09      | I could write it down.                                             |
| 16:10      | Whereas if I'm holding an iPad and an Apple pencil                 |
| 16:14      | and you start telling me a phone number,                           |
| 16:16      | there is like a 10 or 15 seconds of things I need to do            |
| 16:20      | before I can write it down.                                        |
| 16:22      | Gotta get the thing booted up,                                     |
| 16:23      | I gotta get to the right app,                                      |
| 16:25      | I gotta create a new document.                                     |
| 16:26      | And the whole idea with Quick Note is you swipe up                 |
| 16:29      | and you just start writing.                                        |
| 16:31      | What is the Rosemary Orchard workflow                              |
| 16:33      | for taking notes on an iPad?                                       |
| 16:35      | Well, at the moment, I have been using Quick Note a bit,           |
| 16:39      | but obviously the previous iPad Mini                               |
| 16:41      | uses the old Apple pencil,                                         |
| 16:43      | which means that there's always the tap on the screen              |
| 16:45      | with the Apple pencil.                                             |
| 16:47      | Apple pencil's out of battery.                                     |
| 16:49      | Plug the Apple pencil into a lightning port like a dork.           |
| 16:52      | Wait for it to charge up, get distracted, do other things.         |
| 16:58      | But basically a lot of the ways that I currently use               |
| 17:01      | the iPad Mini is with a small folding Bluetooth keyboard.          |
| 17:06      | Because this-                                                      |
| 17:06      | Wow, like an iPad mini size keyboard?                              |
| 17:10      | So it folds down to be a little larger                             |
| 17:12      | than an iPhone Pro Max.                                            |
| 17:14      | Wow.                                                               |
| 17:15      | I'm gonna get a link for the show notes.                           |
| 17:18      | So I have been told by some men                                    |
| 17:20      | that this is a pocketable keyboard.                                |
| 17:24      | I am not 100% sure of that,                                        |
| 17:26      | but it is the kind of thing that fits                              |
| 17:29      | into a smallish, you know, size.                                   |
| 17:35      | So that is quite a good thing.                                     |
| 17:37      | But basically-                                                     |
| 17:38      | Oh, it's not the size of an iPad Mini.                             |
| 17:40      | It's actually a keyboard that's bigger, but it folds up.           |
| 17:44      | Yeah, it folds up.                                                 |
| 17:45      | I have one of those too.                                           |
| 17:46      | It's my previous me charging.                                      |
| 17:47      | And it's pretty good.                                              |
| 17:49      | I also ordered and have already received                           |
| 17:51      | because Apple shipping and logistics,                              |
| 17:53      | the Logitech keys to go in a pink colour,                           |
| 17:56      | because that does not fold.                                        |
| 17:57      | And the one complaint I have about the MoKo foldable               |
| 18:01      | keyboard or indeed any foldable keyboard                           |
| 18:03      | is it folds in the middle.                                         |
| 18:04      | And if you try to use it on your lap,                              |
| 18:07      | then you will experience the pain                                  |
| 18:09      | that is a folding keyboard.                                        |
| 18:10      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 18:11      | I have like a little folding keyboard I got off Amazon.            |
| 18:14      | I'll put a link in as well.                                        |
| 18:16      | I think it was like $20 or $30.                                    |
| 18:18      | And you charge it with micro USB,                                  |
| 18:20      | but I can put it in my bag and like,                               |
| 18:23      | if we're out for a family day or something,                        |
| 18:26      | I keep it like just in case,                                       |
| 18:28      | because sometimes with a lot of practice,                          |
| 18:30      | something comes up where I need to bang out a proper email         |
| 18:34      | and having that little folding keyboard                            |
| 18:36      | makes it a lot easier.                                             |
| 18:37      | I use it with the phone primarily though.                          |
| 18:38      | I've never used it with an iPad Mini.                              |
| 18:41      | Yes, and mine actually pairs with multiple devices,                |
| 18:44      | which is great.                                                    |
| 18:45      | I love that.                                                       |
| 18:47      | And I can only find a four pack on Amazon right now,               |
| 18:51      | but I actually use it with a little iPhone stand,                  |
| 18:57      | which again, folds up to be practically nothing,                   |
| 19:00      | which is great.                                                    |
| 19:02      | And this works.                                                    |
| 19:05      | There also, you can also get larger iPad stands,                   |
| 19:10      | but I've actually gone this time with,                             |
| 19:12      | or larger ones of these stands for the iPad, sorry.                |
| 19:15      | They do a four to 11 inch size,                                    |
| 19:17      | which is not four inches in diameter.                              |
| 19:20      | It's just bigger to be more supportive.                            |
| 19:22      | I found in landscape mode,                                         |
| 19:23      | this is fine for propping up the iPad.                             |
| 19:25      | I'm not gonna be touching the screen huge amounts anyway,          |
| 19:28      | but I've actually gone with the smart cover this time,             |
| 19:31      | which is nice.                                                     |
| 19:33      | That there's of course no trackpad                                 |
| 19:34      | with either of these keyboards, but I can survive.                 |
| 19:37      | The idea is basically just a something's come up                   |
| 19:40      | like I need to log into a server                                   |
| 19:42      | and reboot the Mac Power users forum                               |
| 19:43      | or update the automated forums                                     |
| 19:45      | because something's gone hinky.                                    |
| 19:47      | And I can do that with Secure ShellFish and these two.             |
| 19:52      | It's quite comfortable and easy to do.                             |
| 19:54      | So yeah, that's my little go-to,                                   |
| 19:58      | but I'll be trying the Logitech keys to go.                        |
| 20:01      | It's nice, it's a little spongy feeling,                           |
| 20:03      | but it's also apparently a very durable keyboard.                  |
| 20:06      | So I'm gonna have to see how that pans out.                        |
| 20:09      | All right, well, sounds like we're set for hardware                |
| 20:13      | until Apple announces the M1X.                                     |
| 20:16      | I don't think I'm gonna be getting one.                            |
| 20:18      | I mean, famous last words, right?                                  |
| 20:19      | I wasn't gonna get an M1 Mac, but laptop                           |
| 20:22      | because I didn't need one.                                         |
| 20:23      | And then, well, I got one, but you know,                           |
| 20:27      | the M1s I've got are incredibly powerful and fast.                 |
| 20:32      | And I'm honestly not taxing them at all right now.                 |
| 20:34      | So I don't see a real need to upgrade.                             |
| 20:37      | And also if I do, I think my accountant might kill me.             |
| 20:40      | And there's a really good argument                                 |
| 20:42      | that the M1 is good enough for like 90% of the people,             |
| 20:47      | including myself honestly,                                         |
| 20:48      | but if they come out with an M1X Mac Mini,                         |
| 20:52      | it's gonna be really hard for me to resist that.                   |
| 20:55      | That's what I have to say.                                         |
| 20:56      | Yeah, I mean, I have to say, I've got a Mac Mini,                  |
| 20:58      | my old Mac Mini sitting here on my server                          |
| 21:00      | as a build machine now.                                            |
| 21:02      | So that whenever, you know, one of those apps                      |
| 21:04      | that I mentioned before needs building,                            |
| 21:06      | then it theoretically should happen automagically.                 |
| 21:09      | But yeah, it would be nice if it were an M1                        |
| 21:14      | because it would be even speedier.                                 |
| 21:17      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by privacy.com.       |
| 21:21      | I'm always a little bit anxious                                    |
| 21:22      | when it comes to looking at my money things online.                |
| 21:24      | There's nothing worse than dodgy network or something              |
| 21:26      | where, you know, your details might go missing.                    |
| 21:29      | And of course, there's always that oops, I misclicked              |
| 21:31      | and it looked like my bank story.                                  |
| 21:34      | Privacy is a tool that makes it easy                               |
| 21:35      | to manage your financial lives online                              |
| 21:37      | while keeping your most important information secure.              |
| 21:40      | By generating virtual numbers,                                     |
| 21:42      | privacy masks your bank information.                               |
| 21:44      | So you never have to worry about giving out to people              |
| 21:46      | you don't know online.                                             |
| 21:48      | I'm always a little sketched out                                   |
| 21:50      | when I have to give my car details                                 |
| 21:51      | to somewhere that I don't actually know online.                    |
| 21:54      | Places like Amazon and so on,                                      |
| 21:56      | they've got lots of security behind them                           |
| 21:58      | that this little shop that I've never heard of before              |
| 22:00      | but otherwise seems to have good reviews, maybe not.               |
| 22:03      | Privacy can help keep my details safe                              |
| 22:05      | because of course, if it's a one-time use card number,             |
| 22:08      | then once it's used, it's never going to be used again.            |
| 22:11      | And should something pop up,                                       |
| 22:13      | I'll know where it's come from.                                    |
| 22:15      | Take back control of your payments,                                |
| 22:17      | decide who can charge your card, how much and how often.           |
| 22:20      | And you can close the cards at any time.                           |
| 22:23      | Plus you can make sure                                             |
| 22:24      | that you'll never accidentally bill twice                          |
| 22:25      | or upgraded to another service without your consent.               |
| 22:28      | And privacy is partnered with the good folks at 1Password.       |

| 22:36      | All virtual cards created in 1Password                           |

| 23:00      | Okay, let's switch over from hardware to software.                 |
| 23:05      | So iOS 15 has shipped.                                             |
| 23:09      | There are, there's a story here for automators.                    |
| 23:14      | Let's start with shortcuts.                                        |
| 23:17      | And this is not necessarily a happy story.                         |
| 23:23      | Shortcuts has been rough for me this year                          |
| 23:26      | throughout the beta period.                                        |
| 23:28      | Yeah, yeah, it's been very dodgy for me as well.                   |
| 23:32      | There have been times where stuff just hasn't worked at all.       |
| 23:36      | And there are times right now when things are crashing             |
| 23:38      | and then you, you go back to it later                              |
| 23:41      | and the exact same thing works.                                    |
| 23:43      | Yeah, it seems to me like the problems,                            |
| 23:45      | and I was hoping this would get sorted out                         |
| 23:47      | before they ship it.                                               |
| 23:49      | And this is a complete speculation on my part,                     |
| 23:51      | but I think that probably the problem is                           |
| 23:53      | you've got one team now making it for both Mac                     |
| 23:57      | and iPhone and iPad.                                               |
| 23:58      | So they're probably stretched pretty thin.                         |
| 24:01      | And the one on Monterey Mac is even in worse shape right now.      |
| 24:05      | I'm trying to make a shortcuts field guide for the Mac             |
| 24:08      | and it is rough because I do these rehearsals                      |
| 24:10      | and then I start to record                                         |
| 24:11      | and it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do.                   |
| 24:13      | But it'll get there.                                               |
| 24:16      | But I think the problem is primarily in creation,                  |
| 24:20      | not execution.                                                     |
| 24:20      | Like if you have a working shortcut,                               |
| 24:22      | I don't think you're gonna have any problems.                      |
| 24:25      | Largely, there's a few broken actions,                             |
| 24:26      | but I mean, in general, they'll work.                              |
| 24:28      | But creating shortcuts,                                            |
| 24:29      | I'm really having a lot of troubles                                |
| 24:31      | with like just getting it to like pick a variable                  |
| 24:34      | and things like that.                                              |
| 24:34      | Yeah, or dragging and dropping an action                           |
| 24:37      | and actually putting it where you dropped it.                      |
| 24:39      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 24:40      | Like this should work, but it doesn't.                             |
| 24:42      | Frequently, I end up having to drop the action                     |
| 24:44      | and at the end by just tapping it                                  |
| 24:46      | and then drag it around and then drag some other actions           |
| 24:49      | to move it where I actually want it to go.                         |
| 24:52      | It's just incredibly finicky and frustrating.                      |
| 24:55      | I've actually had better luck                                      |
| 24:57      | creating some shortcuts on macOS,                                  |
| 25:00      | but the problem with creating them on macOS                        |
| 25:02      | is of course that a bunch of the actions aren't available          |
| 25:06      | because it's macOS and shortcuts is need macOS.                    |
| 25:09      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 25:10      | And developers have been busy this summer.                         |
| 25:12      | They've got a lot to do.                                           |
| 25:14      | And I know some development companies                              |
| 25:17      | have just been insanely busy.                                      |
| 25:19      | So they've had to decide that they're gonna focus                  |
| 25:21      | on other things that need supporting first                         |
| 25:24      | and then come back to shortcut support                             |
| 25:27      | for macOS a little bit later,                                      |
| 25:28      | because they're very aware that a lot of their user base           |
| 25:31      | won't be upgrading to Monterey the day releases,                   |
| 25:33      | which is not the same time that iOS 15 releases.                   |
| 25:36      | iOS 15 is releasing as we record on Monday.                        |
| 25:39      | So it should have been out for five days or so                     |
| 25:41      | by the time you get this episode,                                  |
| 25:44      | but Monterey is still coming.                                      |
| 25:47      | So developers have got time there,                                 |
| 25:48      | but equally a lot of people on macOS                               |
| 25:51      | don't upgrade immediately.                                         |
| 25:52      | Yes.                                                               |
| 25:54      | But to the extent it is working                                    |
| 25:55      | or will be working, I think, pretty shortly,                       |
| 25:59      | they have done, they've made changes.                              |
| 26:01      | The user interface or the build environment                        |
| 26:04      | is more compact now.                                               |
| 26:06      | You've got the ability to fold up actions,                         |
| 26:09      | which is something I think we've always kind of wanted.            |
| 26:12      | Yep.                                                               |
| 26:13      | Those are all nice usability improvements.                         |
| 26:16      | We still don't have the ability                                    |
| 26:17      | to blow up a text box into full screen.                            |
| 26:20      | I would like to see that show up at some point.                    |
| 26:23      | But they definitely are moving in the right direction              |
| 26:27      | with that stuff.                                                   |
| 26:33      | I guess some of the other stuff I like is the testing tools,       |
| 26:37      | the ability to kind of like stop                                   |
| 26:39      | and programmatically debug your shortcuts is there.                |
| 26:46      | So I think they're starting to get some more tools                 |
| 26:48      | for people that want to make longer shortcuts.                     |
| 26:51      | Yes.                                                               |
| 26:52      | But equally, we haven't yet received things                        |
| 26:54      | like commenting out shortcut actions,                              |
| 26:56      | which I know a lot of people are looking for.                      |
| 26:58      | I spotted a thread on Reddit about that today                      |
| 27:01      | or a few days ago.                                                 |
| 27:05      | So actually, the solution that I have for this,                    |
| 27:07      | if you want to comment out an action,                              |
| 27:09      | is to add a number action to your shortcut,                        |
| 27:12      | type zero in your number and add a repeat action.                  |
| 27:15      | And then tap and hold on the repeat variable                       |
| 27:17      | and select the number,                                             |
| 27:19      | because then it will repeat zero times.                            |
| 27:21      | And then afterwards, you can just delete the repeat,               |
| 27:24      | which is why occasionally you'll download                          |
| 27:26      | well, my shortcuts and there'll just be                            |
| 27:27      | a strange number zero in there.                                    |
| 27:29      | And that's from me debugging                                       |
| 27:30      | and I didn't delete it at some point.                              |
| 27:33      | But yeah, there are a lot of tools                                 |
| 27:34      | that people are still after,                                       |
| 27:35      | but equally it is definitely getting a lot better,                 |
| 27:38      | which I'm really pleased about.                                    |
| 27:40      | Yeah, in terms of actions,                                         |
| 27:43      | we did talk about this in the WWDC show,                           |
| 27:45      | but I'm happy to report they survived the beta process.            |
| 27:49      | There are a bunch of new files based to actions                    |
| 27:52      | and shortcuts, which I think once they get                         |
| 27:55      | the bugs worked out of this,                                       |
| 27:56      | are gonna be super useful to people                                |
| 27:58      | that wanna make any kind of shortcuts                              |
| 28:00      | that involves files.                                               |
| 28:02      | Yep, yep, I love the fact                                          |
| 28:03      | that you can save these things anywhere.                           |
| 28:06      | I did have an issue actually the other day,                        |
| 28:09      | where I was trying to create a shortcut on macOS,                  |
| 28:13      | I created the shortcut on macOS, it worked perfectly.              |
| 28:16      | I didn't have to pull out my iPhone or my iPad to do it,           |
| 28:19      | but I was trying to save files                                     |
| 28:20      | into a specific folder on my device,                               |
| 28:22      | and it was just not happy about it,                                |
| 28:25      | even though the folder was technically in iCloud.                  |
| 28:28      | I guess maybe my path was wrong or something,                      |
| 28:30      | but it just kind of failed and saved the files                     |
| 28:33      | in the root folder of shortcuts,                                   |
| 28:34      | which is not the kind of error that I was expecting.               |
| 28:37      | Fortunately, macOS Finder,                                         |
| 28:39      | it's really easy to sort by day created                            |
| 28:41      | and just go delete 180 files,                                      |
| 28:45      | because it was creating 180 files.                                 |
| 28:46      | Or if you're fluent in [[Hazel]],                                      |
| 28:49      | you can also build something on that end                           |
| 28:51      | to kind of manage that for you.                                    |
| 28:53      | Yeah, yeah.                                                        |
| 28:53      | If nobody wants to do that,                                        |
| 28:54      | it should all be handled within shortcuts, you know?               |
| 28:56      | But I call it the Mac Boone,                                       |
| 29:00      | you know, the creation of a bunch of tools                         |
| 29:03      | on the Mac side actually came back                                 |
| 29:04      | to the benefit of the iPhone and iPad,                             |
| 29:08      | move file, open file, rename, select,                              |
| 29:12      | folder actions, well not folder actions                            |
| 29:16      | in the sense that you think of them on a Mac,                      |
| 29:17      | but you can do things with the folders now.                        |
| 29:20      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 29:20      | Another Mac Boone, we got our PDF actions,                         |
| 29:23      | but they're not complete yet.                                      |
| 29:25      | We didn't get the full set from Automator.                         |
| 29:27      | I suspect that's just a question of time.                          |
| 29:30      | Yeah, yeah, it will happen, I think.                               |
| 29:33      | It's one of those things where I think they                        |
| 29:35      | have to be a little careful                                        |
| 29:36      | about translating some actions back.                               |
| 29:38      | As far as I'm aware, you still can't have,                         |
| 29:42      | like a shortcut would fail gracefully on a platform                |
| 29:45      | where an action is not available.                                  |
| 29:47      | So for example, if you tried to do a vibrate action                |
| 29:49      | on iPad or Mac, it would just go, eh, I can't do that.             |
| 29:53      | So you have to wrap it in if statement                             |
| 29:55      | and get your device type first to check                            |
| 29:56      | whether or not it's compatible for that,                           |
| 30:00      | which is a bit frustrating,                                        |
| 30:03      | but you could always include a shortcut                            |
| 30:04      | which returns can vibrate or, you know,                            |
| 30:07      | can toggle cellular or something                                   |
| 30:10      | and just, you know, put all the things into that                   |
| 30:13      | that you need and then return yes or no                            |
| 30:14      | and do things based on that.                                       |
| 30:16      | Yeah, I would like to see that get better, honestly.               |
| 30:19      | Yeah, I think that that should just,                               |
| 30:21      | I think there should be an option where, you know,                 |
| 30:23      | with lots of actions where you can tap on that arrow               |
| 30:25      | to reveal more options,                                            |
| 30:27      | you should just be able to like slide on a toggle                  |
| 30:29      | that says ignore if not possible.                                  |
| 30:32      | Or even just like an alert device specific, you know,              |
| 30:36      | like so it vibrates on the phone,                                  |
| 30:37      | but maybe it does something else on the iPad, I don't know.        |
| 30:40      | But the, there are solutions to that.                              |
| 30:43      | And right now the only solution is that we have to be nerdy        |
| 30:46      | and have to write if statements to get around it.                  |
| 30:48      | Yeah, which is not amazing for people who are brand new            |
| 30:52      | to shortcuts, but equally.                                         |
| 30:54      | It's not that hard, yeah.                                          |
| 30:55      | Yeah, it's fine.                                                   |
| 30:56      | So yeah, people can learn                                          |
| 30:59      | and it's actually quite a good practice for learning               |
| 31:01      | how shortcuts works, I think,                                      |
| 31:03      | because it teaches you a bunch of stuff                            |
| 31:04      | that you didn't necessarily already know.                          |
| 31:07      | Yeah, get on screen content.                                       |
| 31:10      | You know, we've got a couple things going                          |
| 31:13      | with the mobile devices this year                                  |
| 31:15      | where they're able to take advantage                               |
| 31:17      | of some new features in the operating system.                      |
| 31:19      | And that adds some interesting fodder for new shortcuts.           |
| 31:24      | Yeah, I'm curious, David, as to how you're using this              |
| 31:26      | because I have to say,                                             |
| 31:28      | it's one of those things I got excited about early on              |
| 31:30      | thinking, oh, I'm gonna be able to do this.                        |
| 31:32      | I tried using it and it crashed hard on me.                        |
| 31:36      | And I kind of gave up after that                                   |
| 31:37      | and got distracted by other things                                 |
| 31:39      | and never really went back to it.                                  |
| 31:41      | I know that you've been playing with this                          |
| 31:42      | a bit more than I have.                                            |
| 31:43      | So what are you currently doing with that?                         |
| 31:45      | I'm not getting it working either at this point,                   |
| 31:48      | but the quick type and the ability to pull                         |
| 31:53      | that type out of pictures I am using                               |
| 31:55      | as Daisy and I continue to work on the Disneyland Field Guide,      |
| 31:57      | I take pictures of like the menus in the restaurants               |
| 31:59      | and things like that, and I can get the text out,                  |
| 32:02      | but they've got the action in there,                               |
| 32:05      | but I just can't get it to work reliably.                          |
| 32:07      | But we're gonna get there, I don't know.                           |
| 32:10      | I feel like I could tie it to a geolocation                        |
| 32:12      | and like have it send me all that text                             |
| 32:15      | without me having to go in and manually grab it.                   |
| 32:18      | I just think, like I said at the beginning,                        |
| 32:20      | kind of the segment is the dark cloud over shortcuts is,           |
| 32:25      | yes, we got some cool new features,                                |
| 32:26      | but right now a lot of it seems                                    |
| 32:28      | like all the pipes aren't connected.                               |
| 32:30      | Yeah, yeah, it really does feel like that to some extent,          |
| 32:34      | but equally some things the pipes are incredibly well              |
| 32:38      | connected on, such as focus modes.                                 |
| 32:40      | Yes.                                                               |
| 32:42      | And oh my gosh, focus modes are so powerful.                       |
| 32:46      | And I had an idea, David, the other day,                           |
| 32:48      | because I have some NFC tags on my desk                            |
| 32:50      | that I use at different times of day.                              |
| 32:52      | Yeah, right on.                                                    |
| 32:53      | Based on, it's actually, I use a different NFC tag                 |
| 32:56      | based on which focus mode I'm in.                                  |
| 32:58      | Yeah, I mean, that's like a two step shortcut, right?              |
| 33:01      | Yeah, but I actually don't anymore.                                |
| 33:03      | I've consolidated down to one NFC tag                              |
| 33:06      | and instead I check which focus mode I'm in                        |
| 33:08      | and I run a different shortcut                                     |
| 33:09      | based on the focus mode that I'm in.                               |
| 33:11      | Okay, explain that.                                                |
| 33:13      | So my NFC tag action now runs, it's actually a shortcut            |
| 33:20      | because I wanted to edit it on the iPad.                           |
| 33:22      | So it runs a shortcut and that shortcut goes,                      |
| 33:24      | hey, and it tries to get the focus mode for me.                    |
| 33:27      | At least this was working the other day.                           |
| 33:29      | I'm now doubting myself as to whether or not                       |
| 33:30      | you can get your current focus mode.                               |
| 33:32      | And of course, shortcuts is crashed.                               |
| 33:33      | So I'm unable to actually double check this.                       |
| 33:37      | Always good when my shortcuts doesn't open.                        |
| 33:40      | Yeah, we make this show without a net.                             |
| 33:44      | I talked about self farting earlier,                               |
| 33:46      | so I don't think it can get any worse.                             |
| 33:49      | Yeah, sorry, there was only the set focus mode.                    |
| 33:51      | That was it, that was it.                                          |
| 33:53      | So I have action set up for my focus modes                         |
| 33:56      | whenever I turn on a focus mode.                                   |
| 33:59      | Or whenever focus modes turn off,                                  |
| 34:02      | that they write to a Data Jar variable.                            |
| 34:05      | And then what I do is I get the variable out of Data Jar.          |
| 34:08      | That's what I'm doing there,                                       |
| 34:09      | to find out which focus mode I'm in.                               |
| 34:11      | And then I just if, and if I'm in work focus mode,                 |
| 34:13      | it runs this shortcut.                                             |
| 34:15      | If I'm in podcasting focus mode,                                   |
| 34:17      | I'm debating splitting podcasting up into three podcasts,          |
| 34:21      | but it runs basically different actions based on that.             |
| 34:24      | And I've actually seen NFC tags                                    |
| 34:26      | are making their way into the mainstream.                          |
| 34:28      | This is kind of cool.                                              |
| 34:30      | I was going through my email earlier today                         |
| 34:32      | and Moft who are the people                                      |
| 34:34      | who make a [[MagSafe]] wallet for the iPhone,                          |
| 34:36      | which is also a stand and some other accessories,                  |
| 34:40      | including like a fake [[MagSafe]] thing for the iPad,                  |
| 34:42      | which I have and I love,                                           |
| 34:45      | are making a smart desk mat                                        |
| 34:49      | where you can like put your devices on it.                         |
| 34:51      | But the thing that caught my eyes,                                 |
| 34:52      | it has two NFC tags built into it, David.                          |
| 34:55      | So NFC tags are hitting the mainstream.                            |
| 34:58      | And the idea is like you tap one of them and it does something     |
| 35:00      | and you tap the other one, it does something else                  |
| 35:02      | and it is to help you work.                                        |
| 35:03      | Like they're showing enabling focus modes                          |
| 35:07      | or a focus thing in an app.                                        |
| 35:12      | I think it's focus minder or something.                            |
| 35:13      | I'm not entirely sure, but I love the idea of this.                |
| 35:17      | It's a really cool idea.                                           |
| 35:19      | And I'm glad that more and more people are seeing NFC tags         |
| 35:22      | for the wonderness that they are,                                  |
| 35:24      | because they are wonderful.                                        |
| 35:25      | So, but the game back to your shortcut, what you're doing is,      |
| 35:29      | you're storing the focus mode,                                     |
| 35:30      | then when you hit the NFC tag,                                     |
| 35:33      | it just runs an if statement to find which focus mode you're in    |
| 35:37      | from your Data Jar variable.                                       |
| 35:39      | And then it does a different,                                      |
| 35:40      | it's almost like a choose from menu at that point,                 |
| 35:42      | where you can set you up.                                          |
| 35:44      | Yeah, so it actually just goes,                                    |
| 35:45      | yeah, it goes through if statements and says,                      |
| 35:48      | if this focus mode, which is actually a text variable,             |
| 35:52      | because I just save it to Data Jars text.                          |
| 35:54      | Yeah, that's easy.                                                 |
| 35:55      | If the text is this, do that.                                      |
| 35:56      | If the text is this, do that.                                      |
| 35:57      | If the text is this, do that.                                      |
| 35:58      | Sure, if it's focus, then open the focus outline                   |
| 36:03      | and turn on audio hijack and like that kind of stuff.              |
| 36:07      | Exactly, yeah, yeah.                                               |
| 36:09      | And I'm not nesting my if statements here                          |
| 36:14      | because nested if statements are hard to read                      |
| 36:17      | and they end up using all the space on,                            |
| 36:19      | especially on an iPhone mini,                                      |
| 36:21      | but even on say, and I've had pro at some point,                   |
| 36:23      | you're using a third of the space                                  |
| 36:25      | if you've got too many nested if statements.                       |
| 36:27      | Instead, I'm using if I've removed the otherwise part              |
| 36:31      | and just added an exit shortcut action in there.                   |
| 36:34      | So it'll do what it's supposed to do                               |
| 36:35      | and then exit the shortcut and that's it.                          |
| 36:38      | And that works really well.                                        |
| 36:39      | So I'm glad that that exists.                                      |
| 36:41      | I'm a big fan of focus mode.                                       |
| 36:45      | I think it's something that everybody should consider.             |
| 36:48      | I do think Apple has a little bit of work                          |
| 36:50      | to make it more accessible to people.                              |
| 36:53      | Yes.                                                               |
| 36:54      | Because like for instance right now                                |
| 36:56      | to allow a group of contacts through,                              |
| 37:00      | you have to select each individual contact                         |
| 37:02      | rather than just picking like a contact                            |
| 37:05      | or an address book group, you can't do that.                       |
| 37:08      | So there's some things I'd like to see them change about it        |
| 37:10      | but I think this is really powerful.                               |
| 37:12      | However, and I'm ashamed to admit                                  |
| 37:15      | as a host of the automator said,                                   |
| 37:17      | I have not combined a much automation with it.                     |
| 37:19      | The way I trigger focus modes is on my watch,                      |
| 37:22      | you've got a really cool way to slide up                           |
| 37:24      | from the clock face on the watch                                   |
| 37:27      | and you can set a focus mode                                       |
| 37:28      | and it respects that across your device                            |
| 37:30      | and I'm off to the races,                                          |
| 37:32      | but I haven't done like a setup type automation,                   |
| 37:36      | which is what you're describing on it                              |
| 37:38      | and I really should.                                               |
| 37:39      | And I think that's kind of like for me,                            |
| 37:43      | that would be something I would wanna run on the Mac               |
| 37:45      | and right now shortcuts on the Mac                                 |
| 37:46      | still needs a bit of work.                                         |
| 37:48      | So maybe when it gets a bit more stable,                           |
| 37:50      | I can do something with that.                                      |
| 37:52      | Yeah, it's one of those things                                     |
| 37:55      | where I have a love hate relationship with focus modes.            |
| 37:58      | There are two bugs in focus modes right now                        |
| 38:00      | which make them very difficult to use.                             |
| 38:03      | As we speak, the release candidate,                                |
| 38:06      | or sorry, the release candidate's been out for a while             |
| 38:09      | but iOS 15 is just publicly launched                               |
| 38:11      | and it is actually a different build.                              |
| 38:12      | So I'm hoping that these two particular bugs have been fixed       |
| 38:15      | because they are incredibly frustrating                            |
| 38:17      | and almost show stoppers.                                          |
| 38:19      | The first is that no call or ID calls                              |
| 38:24      | don't come through in any focus mode.                              |
| 38:26      | Even if that's enabled,                                            |
| 38:27      | my doctors uses no call or ID to call out.                         |
| 38:31      | So if I have a doctor's appointment,                               |
| 38:32      | I will not get that call if I'm in a focus mode.                   |
| 38:36      | And I cannot enable that.                                          |
| 38:38      | So I have to manually go in and disable focus modes                |
| 38:40      | if I'm expecting a call from the doctor,                           |
| 38:42      | which is just incredibly frustrating and annoying                  |
| 38:44      | because I would like that to just come through.                    |
| 38:48      | The other one is shortcuts notifications                           |
| 38:50      | don't come through in focus mode, which is fine                    |
| 38:52      | because I don't necessarily want a,                                |
| 38:54      | your shortcut is running a notification.                           |
| 38:56      | But you know what I would like to see?                             |
| 38:58      | I'd like to see my menus and my lists,                             |
| 39:00      | but I don't because they just don't show up.                       |
| 39:03      | Yeah, like you trigger a shortcut and you don't get anything.      |
| 39:05      | Yeah, like you trigger a shortcut and nothing happens              |
| 39:07      | or it looks like nothing is happening                              |
| 39:09      | and then it times out                                              |
| 39:10      | because you didn't tap a menu option that you can't see.           |
| 39:13      | Yeah, they're so close with this.                                  |
| 39:15      | I just feel like- So close.                                        |
| 39:17      | And I think this is related to the fact                            |
| 39:19      | that shortcuts doesn't have notification settings.                 |
| 39:21      | It's a special one in that notification settings                   |
| 39:25      | are just on, but that also means                                   |
| 39:27      | that I can't explicitly enable shortcuts notifications             |
| 39:30      | in focus modes.                                                    |
| 39:32      | And I've reported this as feedback.                                |
| 39:34      | Other people I know have reported this as feedback,                |
| 39:36      | but it's not been fixed.                                           |
| 39:38      | I expect the team has just been swamped                            |
| 39:40      | dealing with all of the things that they have to deal with,        |
| 39:42      | but it is very frustrating                                         |
| 39:44      | because it does break a lot of my shortcuts automations            |
| 39:47      | because I'm there going,                                           |
| 39:49      | well, I tap this thing, why isn't it?                              |
| 39:51      | Oh, right, I'm in a focus mode.                                    |
| 39:53      | So a lot of my automations,                                        |
| 39:54      | now the first thing it does is it turns off my focus mode.         |
| 39:59      | I just say turn off, do not disturb.                               |
| 40:01      | And that seems to be working as a workaround right now.            |
| 40:04      | Not 100% certain.                                                  |
| 40:06      | But it will probably break again at some point,                    |
| 40:09      | but it turns off, do not disturb.                                  |
| 40:12      | And then it runs my shortcut.                                      |
| 40:14      | And then I have to remember to turn on                             |
| 40:17      | the correct focus mode at the end.                                 |
| 40:19      | As in I use the ask each time focus mode                           |
| 40:23      | and just say turn it on until turned off focus modes               |
| 40:26      | generally are enabled and disabled by automation.                  |
| 40:29      | So they should get turned off then when the automation runs.       |
| 40:33      | Say the end of the working day.                                    |
| 40:35      | Yeah, I would like to see,                                         |
| 40:38      | I would just like to see shortcuts get healthier right now.        |
| 40:43      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 40:44      | And maybe this is like a point one thing.                          |
| 40:48      | One thing I'm certain of is that the shortcut scene                |
| 40:50      | wants to fix that more than I want them to fix it.                 |
| 40:53      | I'm sure they're, it's driving them crazy, but the...              |
| 40:55      | Oh yeah, I'm sure it is.                                           |
| 40:56      | But equally they, you know,                                        |
| 40:58      | everybody needs a work-life balance.                               |
| 41:00      | And I'm hoping that they are finding that                          |
| 41:03      | or attempting to find that                                         |
| 41:04      | and not working themselves to the bone on this.                    |
| 41:06      | It would be wonderful if everything could magically be fixed.      |
| 41:09      | But equally, you know, if some things have to get fixed            |
| 41:13      | in a point one update, then we're gonna have to live with that.    |
| 41:15      | And, you know, expanding the shortcuts platform                    |
| 41:18      | under the Mac was not something you did in an afternoon.           |
| 41:22      | I'm sure they're very busy with that.                              |
| 41:24      | Yeah, it seems to me like it took them quite a while to do.        |
| 41:27      | And they've done an incredibly good job for it.                    |
| 41:31      | And I'm hoping that when Monterey launches,                        |
| 41:33      | everything is gonna just work out with actions                     |
| 41:37      | that are available from Mac OS and iOS applications,               |
| 41:40      | just working interchangeably.                                      |
| 41:42      | So my [[Drafts]] actions will run in shortcuts on the Mac              |
| 41:44      | or shortcuts on my iPhone or iPad.                                 |
| 41:46      | And that'll be fabulous.                                           |

| 42:16      | Hiring a new employee can be harrowing.                            |
| 42:19      | Not only do you have to get the person                             |
| 42:20      | with the right skill set,                                          |
| 42:21      | you also have to get the person with the right attitude.           |
| 42:25      | That's why hiring the right person is so important.                |
| 42:27      | If you get the wrong chemistry in your office,                     |
| 42:30      | all of a sudden, you can't get any work done.                      |

| 43:28      | of the Automators podcast and all of Relay FM.                     |
| 43:33      | So one of the reasons we haven't been able to talk much,           |
| 43:36      | just like offline is that you've been on holiday,                  |
| 43:39      | as you say, if you come from the north of the UK.                  |
| 43:43      | Yes.                                                               |
| 43:44      | But apparently your automation,                                    |
| 43:46      | so you had all your automation set up                              |
| 43:48      | for your home automation when you left                             |
| 43:49      | and you came back to Anarchy.                                      |
| 43:52      | What happened?                                                     |
| 43:53      | Well, there was also some Anarchy while I was gone.                |
| 43:55      | I had some scheduling things                                       |
| 43:57      | that I had to schedule appointments for                            |
| 43:59      | and I forgot that I was on holiday.                                |
| 44:01      | And so I didn't add GMT to things or BST                           |
| 44:05      | as it currently is British summertime                              |
| 44:07      | versus Greenwich Mean Time.                                        |
| 44:09      | And I realised that I was doing things wrong                       |
| 44:11      | and I had to go back through                                       |
| 44:12      | and edit like two different appointments.                          |
| 44:14      | And remember when they were to start with                          |
| 44:16      | that was quite difficult.                                          |
| 44:18      | Because you can't find calendar events                             |
| 44:20      | based on the fact that you added them                              |
| 44:22      | or edited them in the last week.                                   |
| 44:24      | That is actually a little tricky to do.                            |
| 44:27      | And then I created a shortcut, David,                              |
| 44:29      | which just headed them with the correct time zone,                 |
| 44:32      | which fixed that problem.                                          |
| 44:34      | I also pulled out an oldie, but a goodie                           |
| 44:36      | and stuck it back on my home screen.                               |
| 44:38      | On the home screen, it's just referred to as at home,              |
| 44:42      | the at being the at symbol.                                        |
| 44:44      | And when I tap it, it pops open a text field.                      |
| 44:48      | I type multiple new lines of whatever it is.                       |
| 44:50      | I need to remember to do when I get home.                          |
| 44:52      | And it throws it in OmniFocus with my at home tag.                 |
| 44:56      | And that is deferred to the day that I return home,                |
| 45:00      | which works quite nicely.                                          |
| 45:02      | How was it getting the day you returned home?                      |
| 45:05      | It's looking at my calendar at the end                             |
| 45:07      | of the current all day calendar event in the tripped calendar.     |
| 45:10      | Okay, all right.                                                   |
| 45:11      | So that works quite nicely.                                        |
| 45:14      | So that was great, but a couple of days into my holiday,           |
| 45:21      | I noticed that I was no longer able to access                      |
| 45:23      | anything on my home network.                                       |
| 45:24      | And I was more than a little bit concerned about this              |
| 45:27      | because I have multiple devices that should be talking             |
| 45:29      | to the internet on a regular basis.                                |
| 45:31      | At the very least, things like my home automation                  |
| 45:34      | should be accessible to the outside world.                         |
| 45:36      | And it was not.                                                    |
| 45:38      | And in the end, I had a chat, an internet chat with my ASP,        |
| 45:41      | they ran some checks and said,                                     |
| 45:43      | looks like there's possibly a problem with your line.              |
| 45:45      | We'll schedule an engineer to come out.                            |
| 45:47      | They were scheduled to come out today, actually.                   |
| 45:49      | Fortunately, when I got home, I was able to determine              |
| 45:52      | that my internet was not the problem.                              |
| 45:54      | My power was, I'd run out of electricity                           |
| 45:57      | or rather the electricity had gone off at some point               |
| 46:00      | and then a switch in my consumer unit,                             |
| 46:03      | a breaker switch flipped and it didn't come back on.               |
| 46:06      | When the power came back on.                                       |
| 46:08      | And that's problematic because my house is electric,               |
| 46:12      | there is no gas and everything except for the oven                 |
| 46:16      | and the water heater were on these switches.                       |
| 46:18      | So that's internet.                                                |
| 46:21      | That's all of my computers, most of them are on UPS.               |
| 46:23      | So they just shut down automatically                               |
| 46:24      | because they knew, hey, we're running out of power.                |
| 46:27      | I have decided I will be trying to set it up to send an email      |
| 46:30      | when they flip over to UPS battery power.                          |
| 46:32      | That's something that you can do using network UPS tools           |
| 46:36      | or nuts tools.                                                     |
| 46:38      | But to do this, that means that my internet needs to be up         |
| 46:41      | because if my Internet's not up,                                   |
| 46:43      | it can try and send an email all it's like, all it likes.          |
| 46:46      | But guess what, there's no internet.                               |
| 46:49      | If your router just shut itself down,                              |
| 46:50      | what that doesn't do you much good.                                |
| 46:51      | Well, I mean, it's not that it shut itself down,                   |
| 46:53      | it just straight up doesn't have power.                            |
| 46:54      | So I ordered another UPS.                                          |
| 46:55      | I'm in the middle, my TV died just before I went on holiday        |
| 46:58      | as well, brilliant timing.                                         |
| 47:00      | So I'm currently recabling my entire TV unit                     |
| 47:03      | to fit everything in nicely.                                       |
| 47:05      | I've decided to go with dedicated charging drawers                 |
| 47:07      | so that all of my like Nintendo Wii chargers                         |
| 47:10      | and Nintendo switch controllers                                    |
| 47:12      | and all of that can just be in one place                           |
| 47:14      | and you pop open a drawer, you select the controller               |
| 47:16      | you want and it's charged and you're ready to go.                  |
| 47:19      | But the biggest problem with all of this                           |
| 47:22      | was actually my freezer.                                           |
| 47:23      | Oh boy.                                                            |
| 47:24      | Because guess what?                                                |
| 47:25      | My freezer and my fridge lost power for a week.                    |
| 47:30      | Coming home to that at 10.30 at night                              |
| 47:31      | was not my most favourite thing in the world.                       |
| 47:33      | Not pleasant smell I'm sure.                                       |
| 47:35      | Well, actually the smell was fine                                  |
| 47:37      | until I opened the fridge and the freezer door.                    |
| 47:38      | Fortunately, the fridge was pretty much fine                       |
| 47:40      | because I just, I just,                                            |
| 47:43      | I emptied it out aside from like two things                        |
| 47:46      | which had long dates on them before I left.                        |
| 47:49      | The freezer on the other hand,                                     |
| 47:50      | there was freezer soup in the bottom of my freezer, David.         |
| 47:54      | Yeah, there had been ice cream and stuff in there.                 |
| 47:57      | It was not good.                                                   |
| 47:59      | And so I decided this is the point                                 |
| 48:01      | where I need some automation in here.                              |
| 48:03      | I cannot put my fridge in freezer on a UPS.                        |
| 48:06      | I could, but a fridge freezer is gonna use up                      |
| 48:08      | a lot of power on a UPS, it's gonna run for minutes.               |
| 48:11      | And it like, it's not really solving the problem.                  |
| 48:14      | The real solution to the problem here                              |
| 48:17      | is to know that I've lost power.                                   |
| 48:19      | So either I can deal with it                                       |
| 48:21      | or I can call somebody to deal with it for me.                     |
| 48:24      | So there's a couple of things.                                     |
| 48:25      | I'm gonna try using network UPS tools                              |
| 48:28      | or nut tools and [[Home Assistant]].                                   |
| 48:30      | They can integrate with one another.                               |
| 48:32      | I have multiple UPS.                                               |
| 48:33      | So like getting information from at least one of them              |
| 48:36      | should not be a problem.                                           |
| 48:38      | And something you said earlier is something I did.                 |
| 48:40      | I put a UPS on my network closet.                                  |
| 48:43      | So like the router and the cable modem,                            |
| 48:46      | they're on a UPS, that helps.                                      |
| 48:48      | Yeah, so that's one of the other things I got.                     |
| 48:50      | So that'll be the modem router from the ISP,                       |
| 48:54      | which I pretty much just use as a modem.                           |
| 48:56      | The Eero, all the networks running through that                    |
| 48:58      | and all the network switches.                                      |
| 48:59      | There's also, I have hybrid internet.                              |
| 49:02      | So I have a 4G backup basically to my internet connection.         |
| 49:07      | So if the phone line goes down,                                    |
| 49:09      | because that's where my internet comes in,                         |
| 49:10      | I don't have fiber here,                                           |
| 49:12      | then it'll switch over to a 4G backup.                             |
| 49:13      | That is also obviously gonna get plugged in.                       |
| 49:15      | Now, is that an additional service?                                |
| 49:17      | I'm not familiar with that in the U.S.                             |
| 49:19      | Yeah, that was an additional service.                              |
| 49:20      | It's available with BT over here                                   |
| 49:22      | at the principle sum of seven pounds a month,                      |
| 49:24      | which I decided was an excellent price to pay                      |
| 49:28      | to have pretty much guaranteed internet                            |
| 49:30      | considering how reliant both my day job                            |
| 49:33      | and all the podcasting and everything is                           |
| 49:35      | on having internet.                                                |
| 49:36      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 49:38      | So for me, that was well worth paying                              |
| 49:41      | seven pounds a month for that.                                     |
| 49:44      | But I decided that as well as doing all this,                      |
| 49:48      | I need another device as well,                                     |
| 49:50      | which can intervene and potentially use                            |
| 49:53      | any other kind of network connection                               |
| 49:55      | to semi-communication.                                             |
| 49:58      | And I had an idea.                                                 |
| 49:59      | I've talked about my love of push cut automation                   |
| 50:01      | server before David.                                               |
| 50:03      | And it's currently running on an iPod touch,                       |
| 50:05      | which is sitting here on my desk.                                  |
| 50:06      | But I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max sitting right next to it,          |
| 50:10      | which is a test device, which is fine.                             |
| 50:14      | About to get replaced with your iPhone 13 Pro.                     |
| 50:16      | Yeah, well, no, the 12 Pro Max is still a test device,             |
| 50:20      | even if it's push cut automation server device,                    |
| 50:22      | but I can use the mini as a test device.                           |
| 50:25      | And the 12 Pro Max has got really good battery life,               |
| 50:27      | David, like really good battery life.                              |
| 50:31      | So that is gonna become my push cut automation server.             |
| 50:34      | And I'm gonna stick,                                               |
| 50:35      | I think Americans call it pre-pay.                                 |
| 50:37      | We call it pay as you go over here.                                |
| 50:38      | One of those sims in it.                                           |
| 50:41      | And so it will be able to text me, email me.                       |
| 50:46      | It can try and call me.                                            |
| 50:47      | It's not gonna help if it calls me.                                |
| 50:48      | But basically, if my internet goes down                            |
| 50:51      | and power goes down, it's gonna be able to communicate.            |
| 50:54      | But what I'm gonna do is whenever it's disconnected                |
| 50:56      | from power, just straight up boring short cuts automation,         |
| 50:59      | send email, send message.                                          |
| 51:02      | Just do that.                                                      |
| 51:03      | Because if it's trying to send an email and a message,             |
| 51:07      | at least one of those should go through.                           |
| 51:09      | And then it can also queue up                                      |
| 51:11      | automations on its push cut server to run to say,                  |
| 51:16      | hey, check in 15 minutes, whether or not you've got power          |
| 51:19      | and Wi-Fi and then send a message with power,                      |
| 51:24      | whether or not you're plugged in,                                  |
| 51:25      | how much battery you've got                                        |
| 51:26      | and whether or not you're on Wi-Fi.                                |
| 51:29      | And so I'm gonna try and do that for me                            |
| 51:31      | because I think that that is probably a pretty good extra          |
| 51:36      | for this because I have to say,                                    |
| 51:38      | coming home at 10.30 at night and having to empty                  |
| 51:40      | three large rubbish bags of food out of my freezer                 |
| 51:43      | and clean my freezer and ordering new groceries                    |
| 51:46      | to come the next day                                               |
| 51:47      | because I had literally nothing else to eat in the house           |
| 51:49      | was not the most fun experience ever.                              |
| 51:51      | No, I bet.                                                         |
| 51:52      | And it could be fixed.                                             |
| 51:53      | If I had known that my power had gone off                          |
| 51:55      | and my power hadn't come back on,                                  |
| 51:57      | I could have had a friend come                                     |
| 51:58      | and just flipped the switch on the breaker.                        |
| 52:00      | That's a unique problem though.                                    |
| 52:02      | I know there are internet of things devices                        |
| 52:04      | to detect water, for instance,                                     |
| 52:06      | you can put them like in a room where your clothes washer is       |
| 52:10      | and if it leaks, you'll get a notice.                              |
| 52:12      | But the problem with power is that a lot of time,                  |
| 52:15      | power is gonna take down your internet at the same time.           |
| 52:18      | Yeah.                                                              |
| 52:19      | And that's not an easy problem to solve.                           |
| 52:21      | Sounds like you've got a solution though.                          |
| 52:23      | Well, I think I've got two solutions                               |
| 52:24      | because by putting my router, modem,                               |
| 52:26      | a hybrid backup and primary network devices on EPS,                |
| 52:32      | then I should still be able to communicate over a wifi             |
| 52:36      | and so on.                                                         |
| 52:37      | But say, for example, there's a lightning strike                   |
| 52:39      | and it takes out the phone line.                                   |
| 52:40      | That's something that's happened to my parents before.             |
| 52:43      | They had to get the line and socket replaced                       |
| 52:45      | after the next-door neighbour's ham radio fascination               |
| 52:48      | resulted in a lightning strike directly to their house,            |
| 52:52      | which blew out several things in my parents' house.                |
| 52:55      | His mask was not correctly attached to the side of the house.      |
| 52:59      | So of course it just-                                              |
| 53:00      | Grounded, yeah.                                                    |
| 53:01      | Yeah, yeah, it wasn't grounded.                                    |
| 53:02      | So the lightning just went,                                        |
| 53:04      | oh, electricity, let's have some fun with this.                    |
| 53:08      | And had lots of fun, including fun with our house                  |
| 53:10      | because they meet attached houses, it just jumped over.            |
| 53:14      | Was not a big leap for some lightning.                             |
| 53:16      | But yeah, so I've had that happen before.                          |
| 53:20      | I've encountered apparently a couple of interesting problems       |
| 53:24      | involving electricity in my life, David.                           |
| 53:25      | I'm hoping that this is the end of them.                           |
| 53:27      | It certainly could have been worse.                                |
| 53:30      | My TV had already been fried by other purposes                     |
| 53:33      | of playing Mario Kart with some friends                            |
| 53:35      | and one of them said, I'm gonna throw a shell at you.              |
| 53:37      | And then my TV just stopped accepting HDMI input.                  |
| 53:40      | Wait, what's that?                                                 |
| 53:43      | I don't think Alex is truly at fault here,                         |
| 53:46      | but it is very entertaining to try and blame                       |
| 53:48      | my broken TV on him.                                               |
| 53:49      | It's a 12-year-old TV.                                             |
| 53:50      | The HDMI ports giving up is like far from unexpected.              |
| 53:56      | So it's one of those things.                                       |
| 53:58      | 12-year-old TVs after a while.                                     |
| 53:59      | What did you throw?                                                |
| 54:01      | He was go through a red shell at me and Mario Kart.                |
| 54:06      | I guess you're gonna give me a TV.                                 |
| 54:08      | Yeah, yeah, I got a new TV.                                        |
| 54:09      | I got a Philips Hue Ambilight one.                                 |
| 54:12      | So it's got the gradient lights built into the back,               |
| 54:15      | which is really nice because then it's not a home kit TV,          |
| 54:20      | but it is Homebridge supported.                                   |
| 54:22      | But it has that lighting built into the back                       |
| 54:25      | because I couldn't upgrade to a 55-inch TV                         |
| 54:27      | without replacing my living room with a television.                |
| 54:32      | There wouldn't have been space for much else in there              |
| 54:34      | if I'd done that.                                                  |
| 54:35      | So I'm glad I opted for the 43-inch that I've got.                 |
| 54:40      | And it really is lovely.                                           |
| 54:41      | I honestly, though, do think this whole idea                       |
| 54:44      | of kind of like emergency automation                               |
| 54:47      | is something that people should give thought to.                   |
| 54:50      | Have you done any of this stuff with like the water notice         |
| 54:53      | when you get water leaking in your house?                          |
| 54:55      | Yeah, so I actually have a couple                                  |
| 54:57      | of the Aqara flood sensors.                                        |
| 55:00      | That's A-Q-A-R-A.                                                  |
| 55:02      | They're fairly cheap.                                              |
| 55:03      | I already have the Aqara.                                          |
| 55:04      | I actually now have the M2 Hub, David,                             |
| 55:06      | because they are available here in Europe from the Apple stores.   |
| 55:09      | And they're properly available on Amazon.                          |
| 55:11      | So I picked up an M2 Hub, which is a European one.                 |
| 55:14      | And I'm in the process of migrating all my accessories             |
| 55:16      | from the M1S over.                                                 |
| 55:19      | But I've got two flood sensors.                                    |
| 55:21      | One is outside of my storage cupboard,                             |
| 55:24      | just because that's not really waterproofed.                       |
| 55:26      | Everything's up off the floor in there.                            |
| 55:27      | But if water were to enter, I'd like to know.                      |
| 55:31      | And the other thing is the other one                               |
| 55:34      | is attached to my dehumidifier.                                    |
| 55:36      | And I stuck a float sensor in my dehumidifier                      |
| 55:39      | because the actual float sensor built into the dehumidifier        |
| 55:41      | is too high.                                                       |
| 55:43      | And then when I pulled the drawer out of the dehumidifier,         |
| 55:45      | water splooshes everywhere, which is frustrating.                  |
| 55:48      | So I attached, there are two screws on the float sensor            |
| 55:52      | so that you can attach wires to them                               |
| 55:54      | or some other kind of sensor.                                      |
| 55:57      | And so I attached a float sensor to that.                          |
| 55:59      | I stuck the float sensor inside my dehumidifier                    |
| 56:01      | at a lower level, where I can safely pull the drawer out           |
| 56:03      | without water splooshing everywhere and empty it.                  |
| 56:06      | So it tells me now when it's full.                                 |
| 56:08      | I just can't get over how much more inexpensive                    |
| 56:12      | the Aqara stuff is over everything else.                           |
| 56:14      | Like I'm just looking right now                                    |
| 56:15      | because I don't have any float sensors I'm thinking,               |
| 56:18      | I should at least have one in my laundry room.                     |
| 56:20      | And the Fibaro one is $50.                                         |
| 56:26      | The Eve one is $80.                                                |
| 56:29      | And the Aqara one is $18.                                          |
| 56:31      | It's like, how do they get away with making this stuff?            |
| 56:33      | And I'm guessing that's the Amazon price                           |
| 56:35      | because if you look on LA Express,                                 |
| 56:37      | it's probably cheaper than that.                                   |
| 56:39      | Though you'll have to wait 10 days for it to arrive                |
| 56:41      | instead of it coming tomorrow.                                     |
| 56:43      | But they still work, right?                                        |
| 56:44      | I guess I'd have to buy a hub too.                                 |
| 56:46      | I don't have an Aqara hub.                                         |
| 56:48      | Yeah, you probably wouldn't get an Aqara hub.                      |
| 56:50      | If you don't have an Aqara hub                                     |
| 56:52      | but you are looking into [[Home Assistant]],                           |
| 56:55      | you could get a Zigbee dongle for [[Home Assistant]],                  |
| 56:59      | plug that in and pair the Aqara stuff with that                    |
| 57:02      | and then share it back to HomeKit.                                 |
| 57:05      | That is something that you can do.                                 |
| 57:07      | But that is a lot more work than just buying the Aqara hub.        |
| 57:10      | For most people, I would not recommend that route.                 |
| 57:12      | It's just if you're really interested                              |
| 57:14      | in all of the [[Home Assistant]] stuff                                 |
| 57:16      | and trying to minimise the number of hubs you've got,              |
| 57:19      | then [[Home Assistant]] is wonderful.                                  |
| 57:21      | I'm using [[Home Assistant]] as the hub actually                       |
| 57:23      | for a couple of Aqara devices                                      |
| 57:25      | because I wanted to know 10 minutes                                |
| 57:27      | after my dishwasher door opens that I should empty it,             |
| 57:30      | not when my dishwasher door opens.                                 |
| 57:32      | And I just wanted an automation to do that                         |
| 57:34      | and [[Home Assistant]] can do that natively.                           |
| 57:36      | It's really easy.                                                  |
| 57:37      | And you've had pretty good luck with the car                       |
| 57:39      | because I know it keeps coming up on the show for you.             |
| 57:42      | Yeah, it's small, it's cheap, it's reliable                        |
| 57:47      | and it's inobtrusive.                                              |
| 57:48      | Like the stuff is white and a light gray colour                     |
| 57:51      | and it works like there's not a lot more I can really say          |
| 57:55      | other than it does exactly what it's supposed to                   |
| 57:58      | and it doesn't break the bank.                                     |
| 57:59      | I mean, the thing is any individual sensor                         |
| 58:02      | from Aqara is cheap.                                               |
| 58:03      | The problem is you are not gonna want one sensor.                  |
| 58:05      | You're gonna want lots of sensors.                                 |
| 58:07      | Once you realise that you can attach a sensor                      |
| 58:09      | to every single window and door                                    |
| 58:11      | so that you know when you've got out of,                           |
| 58:13      | oh shoot, did I shut that window?                                  |
| 58:15      | Oh yeah, yeah, I did.                                              |
| 58:16      | Like you can check it.                                             |
| 58:17      | Yeah, door and window sensors are $18.                             |
| 58:20      | And just like all this stuff is just like                          |
| 58:21      | so much less expensive than their competitors.                     |
| 58:25      | Yeah, it really is good.                                           |
| 58:27      | So Aqara make things for Xiaomi.                                   |
| 58:30      | And so you can actually buy the Xiaomi things                      |
| 58:34      | and pair them in the Aqara app to the Aqara Hub                    |
| 58:40      | and they should still appear in HomeKit.                           |
| 58:43      | So for example, I bought some Xiaomi motion sensors                |
| 58:49      | because I couldn't get the Aqara one at a time.                    |
| 58:51      | I just wanted to get one and try it to see what it was like.       |
| 58:54      | First of all, those things are tiny,                               |
| 58:55      | like the top half of my thumb, David,                              |
| 58:57      | from the knuckle up to the end of the nail.                        |
| 58:59      | Like that's how big it is.                                         |
| 59:00      | It is so small.                                                    |
| 59:02      | I love it.                                                         |
| 59:03      | Yeah, I'm gonna need you to send me some links.                    |
| 59:05      | I will put them in the show notes too,                             |
| 59:06      | but we've got to.                                                  |
| 59:07      | Yeah, yeah, we will.                                               |
| 59:08      | I think I'm gonna try it.                                          |
| 59:10      | I mean, it's just not that expensive.                              |
| 59:11      | It's 60 bucks to buy the Generation 2 Hub,                         |
| 59:15      | but everything else after that is really inexpensive.              |
| 59:18      | The Generation 2 Hub, and I believe the M1S,                       |
| 59:21      | actually have got matter support now, David.                       |
| 59:25      | They're supporting matter and thread specifically.                 |
| 59:30      | So Aqara are definitely,                                           |
| 59:32      | they're really all in on home automation                           |
| 59:35      | and they are looking towards the future.                           |
| 59:38      | And blinds with a roller chain,                                    |
| 59:41      | like where there's circular chains,                                |
| 59:43      | they are coming out with an atom                                   |
| 59:47      | that you can clip onto a chain to open and close your blinds,      |
| 59:52      | which is pretty awesome.                                           |
| 59:54      | I already have a solution for that with Soma stuff                 |
| 59:56      | because I also have a cord.                                        |
| 59:57      | I have a chain and a cord and I need both of them.                 |
| 01:00:00   | So I went with Soma for that,                                      |
| 01:00:01   | but yeah, it's pretty awesome                                      |
| 01:00:03   | that all the stuff is available and relatively affordable.         |
| 01:00:08   | I mean, as far as home automation guys, it's affordable.           |
| 01:00:10   | They certainly have it all,                                        |
| 01:00:11   | smart plugs, vibration sensors, water sensors.                     |
| 01:00:16   | Yeah, the vibration sensors show up in HomeKit                     |
| 01:00:18   | as motion sensors.                                                 |
| 01:00:20   | So I have one stuck on my office chair                             |
| 01:00:23   | because it's looking for movement in this room,                    |
| 01:00:26   | in my office.                                                      |
| 01:00:28   | And sometimes I'm not moving enough                                |
| 01:00:30   | that either of my other motion sensors,                            |
| 01:00:32   | I have a hue and an IKEA motion sensor in here as well.            |
| 01:00:35   | I'm not necessarily moving enough                                  |
| 01:00:36   | that either one of those will pick me up,                          |
| 01:00:38   | but I am moving enough that the vibration sensor                   |
| 01:00:40   | will pick me up.                                                   |
| 01:00:42   | And also I have one of those on my letterbox.                      |
| 01:00:44   | So whenever a post comes through the door,                         |
| 01:00:46   | I get a notification saying you've got mail                        |
| 01:00:48   | because that's fun.                                                |
| 01:00:49   | All right, yeah, just on the HomeKit topic,                        |
| 01:00:55   | we talked about this recently.                                     |
| 01:00:57   | And as a result of that, I ordered a robot mop                     |
| 01:01:02   | at your insistence.                                                |
| 01:01:03   | It's the little one.                                               |
| 01:01:05   | Yeah, you got the one with Wi-Fi though, right?                    |
| 01:01:08   | Because TJ also emailed in about this                              |
| 01:01:11   | because he wanted to tell me there's a deep clean feature          |
| 01:01:14   | and my robot mop is very dumb.                                     |
| 01:01:17   | It doesn't have Wi-Fi                                              |
| 01:01:18   | because you have to go and fill it with water first anyway.        |
| 01:01:20   | So it doesn't have a deep clean feature unfortunately,             |
| 01:01:23   | but I believe yours might.                                         |
| 01:01:24   | Yeah, and it works great.                                          |
| 01:01:25   | I just wanted to add to that.                                      |
| 01:01:26   | I've got the robot vacuum and the robot mop                        |
| 01:01:29   | and like we said during the show,                                  |
| 01:01:32   | the trick with these things is to run them regularly               |
| 01:01:35   | and they do a good job.                                            |
| 01:01:37   | You still may need to sweep and mop once in a while,               |
| 01:01:40   | but much less often.                                               |
| 01:01:41   | Yes.                                                               |
| 01:01:42   | Dog is used to them now.                                           |
| 01:01:44   | Dog doesn't care anymore.                                          |
| 01:01:46   | For a while that was a big deal to her,                            |
| 01:01:48   | but now she doesn't care.                                          |
| 01:01:49   | Oh, yeah, yes.                                                     |
| 01:01:51   | Now I remember the first time Smudge,                              |
| 01:01:52   | my foster cat made her acquaintance                                |
| 01:01:54   | with the robot vacuum and it was her own fault                     |
| 01:01:58   | because she was playing around                                     |
| 01:01:59   | and apparently moved it off the dock a bit.                        |
| 01:02:01   | And so it came out to like greet her                               |
| 01:02:04   | and she was not impressed at all.                                  |
| 01:02:07   | And they spent 20 minutes trying to get under the furniture        |
| 01:02:09   | to attack the brushes.                                             |
| 01:02:11   | So I had to take the robot vacuum away                             |
| 01:02:13   | and hide it in the cupboard while I was fostering her              |
| 01:02:15   | because she was half-scared.                                       |
| 01:02:17   | All right, last question for you today.                            |
| 01:02:19   | We've talked about iOS 15.                                         |
| 01:02:22   | We are a little disappointed                                       |
| 01:02:23   | with some of the shortcuts bugs,                                   |
| 01:02:25   | but I think that's going to eventually get fixed.                  |
| 01:02:28   | So let's assume they're going to get it all working.               |
| 01:02:31   | And somebody comes up to Rose, Mary Orchard and said,              |
| 01:02:34   | okay, Rose, we're starting a plan for iOS 16.                      |
| 01:02:37   | What direction do they need to go with shortcuts                   |
| 01:02:39   | for next year?                                                     |
| 01:02:42   | Hmm, this is a tricky one                                          |
| 01:02:46   | because they've already added a lot.                               |
| 01:02:48   | I think it's a little difficult to see right now                   |
| 01:02:53   | because a lot of the people have been quite nervous                |
| 01:02:54   | to get their hands on shortcuts and so on                          |
| 01:02:57   | because we've had corrupted databases                              |
| 01:02:59   | and stuff in the past.                                             |
| 01:03:01   | But I think I would just like to see more deeper integrations      |
| 01:03:07   | with the operating system.                                         |
| 01:03:08   | For example, telling me what my current focus mode is              |
| 01:03:10   | and so on.                                                         |
| 01:03:12   | It's not that I'm wanting them to show lock things                 |
| 01:03:14   | like [[Toolbox Pro]], but equally,                                     |
| 01:03:16   | I also know that [[Alex Hay]], maker of Toolbox Pro                    |
| 01:03:19   | is very happy when some of his actions                             |
| 01:03:23   | get show locked by the [[Shortcuts]] team                              |
| 01:03:25   | because it means that they're useful                               |
| 01:03:28   | to the shortcuts audience.                                         |
| 01:03:30   | And so knowing, for example,                                       |
| 01:03:32   | if I'm in light mode or dark mode,                                 |
| 01:03:34   | and things like that is useful.                                    |
| 01:03:36   | And I would really love to see that become a native action         |
| 01:03:40   | inside of shortcuts because things like focus modes                |
| 01:03:44   | and so on are incredibly powerful,                                 |
| 01:03:46   | but being able to switch between things                            |
| 01:03:49   | knowing which focus mode I'm in as well is even better.            |
| 01:03:53   | Like I would love to change my wallpaper                           |
| 01:03:55   | when I activate any focus mode,                                    |
| 01:03:58   | depending on which focus mode I'm in,                              |
| 01:04:00   | but I would like to have them all in one shortcut                  |
| 01:04:01   | instead of having different shortcuts                              |
| 01:04:03   | for each different focus mode.                                     |
| 01:04:05   | And yeah, that's not ideal.                                        |
| 01:04:08   | So I think that and graceful failures                              |
| 01:04:11   | with non-supported device actions,                                 |
| 01:04:14   | like vibrating a Mac.                                              |
| 01:04:16   | I understand I can't vibrate a Mac,                                |
| 01:04:18   | but let me just continue anyway, please.                           |
| 01:04:21   | Yeah, I guess my request would be,                                 |
| 01:04:25   | I feel like they made progress on automation tasks,                |
| 01:04:28   | but it's too fiddly and too many notifications                     |
| 01:04:32   | and too many confirmation dialog boxes.                            |
| 01:04:35   | I'd like them to give users more power here.                       |
| 01:04:38   | And even if I have to go into a buried setting                     |
| 01:04:41   | and throw a switch, I'd be willing to do that.                     |
| 01:04:44   | And I would just like to see the automation stuff                  |
| 01:04:46   | become more automatic                                              |
| 01:04:47   | because a lot of it is not automatic enough,                       |
| 01:04:50   | I think at this point.                                             |
| 01:04:53   | Another thing I'd like to see them put some effort into            |
| 01:04:55   | is make the screen time data just more accessible.                 |
| 01:04:58   | Not only, I talked on the MPU,                                     |
| 01:05:01   | I'd like this to be available to third party developers            |
| 01:05:03   | so they can develop apps using screen time data.                   |
| 01:05:06   | I feel like screen time is just a feature                          |
| 01:05:08   | that Apple kind of built and then kind of ignored.                 |
| 01:05:11   | But if you can just give me that data                              |
| 01:05:13   | where a third party app developer could use the data               |
| 01:05:16   | to give me better features,                                        |
| 01:05:17   | or if I could write my own in shortcuts,                           |
| 01:05:19   | I would like to see that happen.                                   |
| 01:05:22   | Yes, yes, I fully agree with that.                                 |
| 01:05:25   | That would be wonderful.                                           |
| 01:05:27   | And in fact, generally having openness                             |
| 01:05:29   | and the ability to extract all this data                           |
| 01:05:32   | using shortcuts from all of the things would be wonderful.         |
| 01:05:36   | We're getting there with being able to save files anywhere         |
| 01:05:39   | in iCloud Drive, that is fabulous.                                 |
| 01:05:42   | But more steps are always great.                                   |
| 01:05:45   | And if any of the shortcuts seem to be listening,                  |
| 01:05:46   | they should not be disheartened by the fact                        |
| 01:05:49   | that there are still bugs.                                         |
| 01:05:50   | I'm a developer myself,                                            |
| 01:05:52   | I understand everything ships with bugs                            |
| 01:05:54   | and you're working hard, I'm very sure of that.                    |
| 01:05:56   | Oh yeah.                                                           |
| 01:05:57   | Yeah, it can only get better, that's the thing.                    |
| 01:06:01   | Yeah, yeah, it's a good thing.                                     |
| 01:06:04   | Like things are definitely improving,                              |
| 01:06:06   | you can't make progress without making a couple of bugs            |
| 01:06:09   | in the way.                                                        |
| 01:06:10   | Was it gonna break a few eggs?                                     |
| 01:06:12   | Can it scramble me?                                                |
| 01:06:13   | Yes, to make an omelet.                                            |
| 01:06:15   | Yeah, I do think that we should reiterate                          |
| 01:06:19   | that it's amazing how far shortcuts has come.                      |
| 01:06:23   | And I think it's only natural to have some growing pains           |
| 01:06:25   | when you're developing onto an entirely new platform               |
| 01:06:28   | at the same time you're trying to update the old one.              |
| 01:06:30   | So we are both big fans of what they're doing                      |
| 01:06:34   | and I know they're putting everything they have into this.         |
| 01:06:36   | But right now it's kind of hard to use.                            |
| 01:06:39   | And if you're listening to the show,                               |
| 01:06:41   | you're fine using your shortcuts.                                  |
| 01:06:44   | If you're trying to create new shortcuts                           |
| 01:06:45   | and you're having problems, just hang in there, you know.          |
| 01:06:50   | But do file bugs.                                                  |
| 01:06:51   | I mean, if you've got a way to report bugs,                        |
| 01:06:53   | that really helps these guys and gals                              |
| 01:06:55   | to know where they need to direct their attention.                 |
| 01:06:59   | Yes, apple.com/feedback.                                     |
| 01:07:01   | File bugs, but not like a joint, you know.                         |
| 01:07:04   | Make sure that you include reproduction steps,                     |
| 01:07:06   | screenshots wherever possible and so on.                           |
| 01:07:09   | I know some bugs don't show up.                                    |
| 01:07:10   | If you try and screen record them,                                 |
| 01:07:11   | that is useful information, tell them that.                        |
| 01:07:14   | Still include the screen recording                                 |
| 01:07:15   | and say it's not happening in the screen recording.                |
| 01:07:19   | So that they know what steps you're doing                          |
| 01:07:21   | and how to recreate it themselves.                                 |
| 01:07:23   | Like give them as much details possible.                           |
| 01:07:25   | And I know these people, they are wonderful people.                |
| 01:07:28   | They are working really hard.                                      |
| 01:07:29   | I am 100% sure of that.                                            |
| 01:07:31   | So just giving them the data so that they know                     |
| 01:07:33   | what you found that's broken                                       |
| 01:07:34   | or what you think is broken is very helpful for everybody.         |
| 01:07:39   | And feel free to share those bugs.                                 |
| 01:07:41   | When you find them on Twitter or in the forums                     |
| 01:07:44   | or something like that.                                            |
| 01:07:45   | So that other people can also verify                               |
| 01:07:49   | and maybe see if they can find a workaround for you                |
| 01:07:51   | or say that's how it's supposed to work                            |
| 01:07:53   | if they happen to know that it's always worked like that.          |
| 01:07:57   | But yeah, it's always good to work together                        |
| 01:08:00   | as a community to help everybody out.                              |
| 01:08:02   | Got any automation problems you're trying to solve, Rose?          |
| 01:08:04   | Anything on your plate?                                            |
| 01:08:06   | I mean, aside from the lack of power,                              |
| 01:08:08   | I'm focusing on that one right now.                                |
| 01:08:12   | And yeah, I'm gonna have to work on some other things              |
| 01:08:15   | I have been not experimenting with,                                |
| 01:08:18   | but using the or disabling the auto-join Wi-Fi option recently     |
| 01:08:23   | because I was using a roaming hotspot when I was in France,        |
| 01:08:27   | but I didn't want all of my devices                                |
| 01:08:29   | to immediately hop onto the hotspot as soon as it came up          |
| 01:08:31   | because of course it slows things down.                            |
| 01:08:33   | So I fixed that.                                                   |
| 01:08:34   | I automated my problem away                                        |
| 01:08:36   | by disabling auto-join network, which works wonderfully.           |
| 01:08:41   | So I'm quite pleased about that.                                   |
| 01:08:43   | And yeah, other than that,                                         |
| 01:08:46   | I've not really got a lot going on right now.                      |
| 01:08:47   | David, what about you?                                             |
| 01:08:49   | I am doing an experiment.                                          |
| 01:08:50   | I'm about two weeks into it now                                    |
| 01:08:52   | where I am not using toggle and Timery,                            |
| 01:08:56   | which are a nice combination for time tracking,                    |
| 01:09:00   | but instead just using the timing app.                             |
| 01:09:03   | Just for a variety of reasons.                                     |
| 01:09:05   | The M1 Macs are so powerful and the battery lasts so long          |
| 01:09:08   | that I find that I'm not using the iPad as often                   |
| 01:09:12   | for work-y work these days.                                        |
| 01:09:16   | So as a result, I've got really good data and timing.              |
| 01:09:19   | Timing not only tracks data on your main Mac,                      |
| 01:09:21   | but it tracks it on your second Mac as well.                       |
| 01:09:24   | So I've got really good data for time tracking and timing,         |
| 01:09:26   | and it makes it very easy while you're sitting at your Mac         |
| 01:09:29   | to modify and set new timers or report in time.                    |
| 01:09:34   | And because the app shows you exactly                              |
| 01:09:36   | what you were doing in that minute,                                |
| 01:09:38   | what app you were in,                                              |
| 01:09:39   | it makes it very easy to get really accurate time tracking,        |
| 01:09:43   | but it doesn't have really a mobile app.                           |
| 01:09:45   | But they have this web API and a web service                       |
| 01:09:49   | and they even have some shortcuts, actions they've created.        |
| 01:09:53   | But I really want to like dig in on that right now                 |
| 01:09:56   | and see if I can make timing work when I'm not at a Mac.           |
| 01:10:01   | And I need to do some work with these,                             |
| 01:10:04   | with their existing shortcuts.                                     |
| 01:10:05   | I want to make some modifications                                  |
| 01:10:07   | and see if I can automate them for specific projects               |
| 01:10:10   | and things like that.                                              |
| 01:10:11   | So I haven't even really started the project                       |
| 01:10:13   | and I've just started doing the research on it,                    |
| 01:10:15   | but that is the automation project                                 |
| 01:10:17   | that I can report in on probably next time we do a show.           |
| 01:10:20   | Excellent. I'm looking forward to it.                              |
| 01:10:22   | I am going to be going all in again on time tracking               |
| 01:10:25   | in a couple of weeks most likely,                                  |
| 01:10:28   | and just giving that another go,                                   |
| 01:10:30   | because I kind of fell off a little bit over the summer            |
| 01:10:33   | while I was messing around with lots of things                     |
| 01:10:35   | and I broke a whole bunch of automations, of course,               |
| 01:10:38   | because there's betas, so break things,                            |
| 01:10:42   | because that's what happens.                                       |
| 01:10:44   | And so I will be playing with that a lot                           |
| 01:10:47   | and I think I'm going to be using Timery for this,                 |
| 01:10:49   | because a lot of my time tracking is based on iOS work.            |
| 01:10:53   | And that and focus modes combined,                                 |
| 01:10:55   | I think are going to be the power feature for me.                  |
| 01:10:58   | Well, I mean, and Timery has an excellent Mac app.                 |
| 01:11:01   | It's still a great solution, but you know, I'm just a nerd         |
| 01:11:04   | and once in a while, I've got to try something different           |
| 01:11:06   | just to see how it's going.                                        |
| 01:11:07   | Absolutely.                                                        |
| 01:11:08   | And I do like the accuracy of the data and timing,                 |
| 01:11:13   | because I mean, you don't have to throw a switch.                  |
| 01:11:15   | It's just looking for you.                                         |
| 01:11:17   | Yeah. Yeah, I do love that feature.                                |
| 01:11:19   | All right. Well, we are the Automators podcast.                    |

| 01:11:39   | Anything going on?                                                 |
| 01:11:40   | Anything going on in your life, Rose,                              |
| 01:11:42   | that we should be sharing with folks?                              |
| 01:11:44   | Well, I did recently switch my website                             |
| 01:11:46   | from WordPress to Jekyll.                                          |
| 01:11:48   | It's still at rosemaryorchard.com.                                 |
| 01:11:50   | It looks very similar, but it's much faster to load,               |
| 01:11:53   | which is a good thing.                                             |
| 01:11:54   | And there are some pages that are missing.                         |
| 01:11:56   | I'm aware my recommendations page needs to come back.              |
| 01:11:58   | I've already had three emails about that.                          |
| 01:12:00   | Thank you for people who love that page.                           |
| 01:12:02   | And I will be bringing that back soon.                             |
| 01:12:04   | But if anything's broken there and you stumble across it,          |
| 01:12:07   | feel free to hit me up in my email or Twitter                      |
| 01:12:10   | and let me know something's broken,                                |
| 01:12:12   | because I would love to fix it.                                    |
| 01:12:14   | So, yes.                                                           |
| 01:12:15   | That's what I've been doing there.                                 |
| 01:12:17   | That was my holiday project, David.                                |
| 01:12:19   | I finally moved CMS to something that's considerably               |
| 01:12:21   | better than WordPress.                                             |
| 01:12:23   | At least for me.                                                   |
| 01:12:24   | It's a great website, and I love it.                               |
| 01:12:26   | So, I'm glad your speed ended up.                                  |

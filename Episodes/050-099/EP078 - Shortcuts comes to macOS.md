| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators. I'm David Sparks, and I'm joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                              |
| 00:07      | How are you, Rosemary?                                                                                                    |
| 00:09      | Oh, I'm excited, David. WWDC happened. There was an impulse purchase on my end. Yeah,                                     |
| 00:16      | things are exciting in a very good way.                                                                                   |
| 00:19      | Yeah, I mean, once a year, Apple unwraps the Christmas presents for us, and as automators,                                |
| 00:24      | we're always on the lookout for new stuff, and this year they deliver it again.                                           |
| 00:28      | We're going to spend a lot of this episode going through it, but at the top of the show,                                  |
| 00:32      | I just want to say, I feel like The Automators team and the Shortcuts team in particular                                  |
| 00:37      | are the boss over there. They're just doing so good right now.                                                            |
| 00:40      | Oh, yeah, yeah. I am really impressed. Multiple videos, Shortcuts appearing in videos                                     |
| 00:47      | that are technically not about shortcuts. It's great. I'm so impressed.                                                   |
| 00:52      | They're really doing such a great job. Not only are they delivering a great app and service,                              |
| 00:59      | but they're clearly influencing other people there, which is just wonderful.                                              |
| 01:04      | And they've become Mac developers this year.                                                                              |
| 01:07      | Yeah, which we hoped about, but we didn't expect.                                                                         |
| 01:12      | We hoped.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13      | And yes, we got it.                                                                                                       |
| 01:15      | So we're going to get into all of that, but I'm not going to slip by that you just talked about an impulse purchase.      |
| 01:23      | And what happened, Rose?                                                                                                  |
| 01:27      | Okay, well, so this is linked to the fact that Shortcuts will be coming to Mac OS Monterey.                               |
| 01:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:36      | So of course, I have a book, Take Control Shortcuts. You have Shortcuts Field Guide.                                      |
| 01:42      | So this means for both of us, there is work required.                                                                     |
| 01:45      | And to some extent, this work is required before this is publicly available or before it's a standard release for people. |
| 01:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:53      | Now, I have a lovely M1 iMac. This is what I'm using right now. I'm recording on it. It works great.                      |
| 01:59      | But as you and I both know, and I'm sure many of our listeners are aware,                                                 |
| 02:03      | if you install a beta operating system, you can expect a certain number of things not to work.                            |
| 02:09      | And considering the fact that I have three podcasts, I have screencasts, I have writing and so on,                        |
| 02:15      | I thought, ah, but Monterey Crash is probably not going to, you know,                                                     |
| 02:20      | fly as an excuse for more than a day or two.                                                                              |
| 02:23      | I'm going to have a queue of people lining up to kill me if I just upgrade that.                                          |
| 02:28      | So I upgraded my Intel MacBook Air.                                                                                       |
| 02:30      | Now, my Intel MacBook Air has had an exciting couple of years since I got it.                                             |
| 02:37      | It likes its fans.                                                                                                        |
| 02:40      | And it's been around the world almost literally, mileage wise.                                                            |
| 02:45      | And it's a great machine. There is nothing wrong with it.                                                                 |
| 02:49      | But oh my gosh, the thing is loud. And I nuked it and paved it for Monterey.                                              |
| 02:53      | It didn't help.                                                                                                           |
| 02:55      | And it was honestly just giving me a bit of a headache.                                                                   |
| 02:58      | And then I found some of the Monterey features are only available on an M1 Mac.                                           |
| 03:02      | And of course, a lot of the apps which are going to be having shortcut support                                            |
| 03:07      | will also be just going, OK, actually, we're going to release our iOS app on macOS.                                       |
| 03:12      | But for that, you need an M1.                                                                                             |
| 03:14      | So the Intel won't work for those apps, yeah.                                                                             |
| 03:16      | The Intel does not work for those Macs at all.                                                                            |
| 03:19      | And so I looked at it and I went, huh, and I looked on the refurb store                                                   |
| 03:24      | and next day delivery on a refurbished MacBook Pro was available.                                                         |
| 03:30      | So at that arrive last Thursday.                                                                                          |
| 03:33      | Nice. Did you sell your Intel machine back to Apple?                                                                      |
| 03:36      | I have not yet sold my Intel machine. It's on my to-do list.                                                              |
| 03:39      | Or actually, technically, it's in my OmniFocus.                                                                           |
| 03:41      | I wanted to make sure that I've completely and utterly wiped that machine                                                 |
| 03:45      | before I send that off.                                                                                                   |
| 03:47      | But yeah, I will be getting rid of that because there's no point having two laptops,                                      |
| 03:52      | at least for me.                                                                                                          |
| 03:54      | I'm fine with, you know, now I'm sitting here surrounded by M1s.                                                          |
| 04:00      | Technically, my 12 Pro Macs does not have an M1 chip inside it,                                                           |
| 04:03      | but I've got a 12.9 inch iPad Pro here, a 13 inch MacBook Pro and an M1 Mac                                               |
| 04:09      | all within, you know, hands reach.                                                                                        |
| 04:12      | And wow, I'm loving the M1 life. It's so quiet, David.                                                                    |
| 04:15      | Yeah, you told me like a month ago that your plan was to just use the iMac as your Mac                                    |
| 04:20      | and then use your iPad with through like remote desktop to go in and run Mac stuff                                        |
| 04:27      | off your iPad like it was a laptop.                                                                                       |
| 04:29      | Yeah, and honestly, my plan for many things is absolutely still that.                                                     |
| 04:34      | I was hoping a little bit more for more developer-y targeted announcements at WWDC.                                       |
| 04:43      | So, you know, being able to run a standard terminal on my iPad would be great,                                            |
| 04:48      | but there are apps for that like Secure Shellfish, Prompt from Panic,                                                     |
| 04:52      | things like that, all of which work great.                                                                                |
| 04:54      | So, you know, that's perfect.                                                                                             |
| 04:56      | But in this particular case, you know, I need to write a book on shortcuts,                                               |
| 05:01      | including shortcuts for Mac.                                                                                              |
| 05:02      | And as people are going to find out, that's not just a case of,                                                           |
| 05:05      | and it runs on the Mac, there's a lot more to it than it just runs on the Mac.                                            |
| 05:09      | So I need to be able to take all the screenshots and everything.                                                          |
| 05:11      | I consider doing a virtual machine or installing it on an external keyboard,                                              |
| 05:17      | all kinds of things.                                                                                                      |
| 05:18      | And I thought, no, the best solution really is just have a machine,                                                       |
| 05:22      | and this machine is the machine for this.                                                                                 |
| 05:24      | And who knows, I may actually sell it, you know, in a couple of months.                                                   |
| 05:30      | That would be fine.                                                                                                       |
| 05:31      | But I may not.                                                                                                            |
| 05:32      | Nothing should.                                                                                                           |
| 05:33      | I'll see.                                                                                                                 |
| 05:34      | My advice is to wipe your Intel Mac, get what you can from it from Apple,                                                 |
| 05:40      | or if you want to like deal with the third party sellers.                                                                 |
| 05:42      | So they usually get you a little bit more money,                                                                          |
| 05:44      | but it comes a little more headache.                                                                                      |
| 05:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 05:47      | So Apple is not going to give me a lot of money for the MacBook Air,                                                      |
| 05:49      | even though it's definitely, but if you buy it from Apple,                                                                |
| 05:52      | they're selling it for at least three times the price that they would give me for it.                                     |
| 05:56      | So I am going to go ahead and put that one on eBay.                                                                       |
| 05:59      | I need to double check that I can't convince my mom to upgrade from her first                                             |
| 06:02      | generation 12 inch MacBook, just MacBook.                                                                                 |
| 06:05      | But, you know, we'll see.                                                                                                 |
| 06:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 06:08      | But I would try and monetise that one and just keep the M1 because that's really the way                                  |
| 06:13      | and you get so spoiled with these laptops where the battery just runs all day.                                            |
| 06:17      | And I can't imagine you getting rid of it.                                                                                |
| 06:21      | I have been thinking too about, I know the show's about hardware,                                                         |
| 06:24      | but, but, you know, here I am.                                                                                            |
| 06:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 06:27      | I've been thinking a lot about it because, you know, we had these rumored                                                 |
| 06:29      | laptops coming out the MacBook Pros and I still think they're going to come out soon.                                     |
| 06:33      | And they're going to be like screamers, you know, compared to the M1s.                                                    |
| 06:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 06:38      | And, you know, like what is my next move?                                                                                 |
| 06:40      | You know, because I'm a nerd and I always am thinking about that.                                                         |
| 06:44      | So I was thinking I'd get a, you know, just a loaded MacBook Pro and make that my only                                    |
| 06:48      | Mac.                                                                                                                      |
| 06:49      | I've got this cool monitor I can plug it into, but it's just, that just never works                                       |
| 06:52      | for me.                                                                                                                   |
| 06:53      | I tried using this M1 laptop that way for a couple of weeks and it just, I just like the                                  |
| 06:58      | ability to sit down on my computer and start working and plugging and unplugging always                                   |
| 07:02      | seems to have headaches compared that I didn't, that I don't want to deal with.                                           |
| 07:06      | So currently I have an M1 laptop and an M1 Mac mini.                                                                      |
| 07:11      | And the more I think about it, I think my strategy will be whenever, you know, the stuff shakes                           |
| 07:16      | loose is to get the loaded Mac mini, whatever the next, you know, the, like the pro, I'm                                  |
| 07:21      | holding up air quotes, Mac mini is just kind of improve the Mac mini a bit and have that                                  |
| 07:26      | the one attached to my monster monitor and just keep the M1 laptop and just, you know,                                    |
| 07:31      | because for on the road and, and moving around, this is all the computer I need.                                          |
| 07:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 07:37      | Yeah, I have to confess the one thing I had kind of forgotten about is there are some                                     |
| 07:41      | events that I like to attend, which have hackathon days as the second day.                                                |
| 07:46      | And it's okay to remote into your machine for like half an hour, an hour or two is worth                                  |
| 07:51      | of use.                                                                                                                   |
| 07:52      | But if you're taking part in a hackathon, being able to run your code directly on your                                    |
| 07:56      | machine, regardless of the network is definitely something that I need to keep in mind.                                   |
| 08:01      | So I suspect that this M1 MacBook Pro is here to stay.                                                                    |
| 08:06      | I love it.                                                                                                                |
| 08:07      | You know, I've not had a 13 inch MacBook Pro before actually.                                                             |
| 08:10      | I've had a 15 inch.                                                                                                       |
| 08:12      | Actually, no, that's a lie.                                                                                               |
| 08:14      | My first MacBook after the MacBook Air was a 13 inch pro, but that had the CD slot in the                                 |
| 08:18      | side.                                                                                                                     |
| 08:19      | I've not had the modern form factor with USB C and I like it.                                                             |
| 08:22      | It's great.                                                                                                               |
| 08:23      | It seems to be doing everything I need it to do so far.                                                                   |
| 08:26      | I will say I'm still using my M1 iMac for most things.                                                                    |
| 08:30      | I'm sitting here talking into it right now because, you know, it's already set up for                                     |
| 08:35      | that.                                                                                                                     |
| 08:36      | But I've got the M1 MacBook Pro right here under my microphone because we've got plenty                                   |
| 08:40      | to talk about on the Mac today, David.                                                                                    |
| 08:42      | I am so excited that Apple is paying attention to automation on the Mac and everywhere, clearly,                          |
| 08:49      | because it's everywhere this year.                                                                                        |
| 08:51      | In particular on the Mac.                                                                                                 |
| 08:53      | And so we talked earlier that Apple's bringing shortcuts to the Mac.                                                      |
| 08:56      | There's a really good interview at Mac Power Users.                                                                       |
| 08:59      | We'll put a link in the show note where we, we actually had an Apple representative come                                  |
| 09:03      | on the show and talk about it.                                                                                            |
| 09:05      | The concern I had with shortcuts coming to the Mac was, you know, we have a rich ecosystem                                |
| 09:11      | of automation already on the Mac between [[AppleScript]], Shell script, and all the cool things                              |
| 09:16      | you can do with apps like [[Hazel]] and Automator and even TextExpander.                                                      |
| 09:21      | So number one is I wanted them to focus more on automation on mobile devices because there                                |
| 09:28      | is no rich ecosystem there.                                                                                               |
| 09:30      | It's just shortcuts.                                                                                                      |
| 09:32      | And number two, I was worried about if Apple shows up with shortcuts on the Mac, what,                                    |
| 09:38      | you know, are they going to start lobbying hand grenades at their competition?                                            |
| 09:43      | And like, are they going to disable AppleScript or are they going to make it so apps                                     |
| 09:49      | like [[Keyboard Maestro]] can't work on a Mac?                                                                                |
| 09:52      | And that's not the case.                                                                                                  |
| 09:54      | I mean, I think my worries were ill founded in hindsight because just on the, you know,                                   |
| 10:01      | zooming out on the 50,000 foot level, we've got shortcuts on the Mac, which brings over                                   |
| 10:07      | a bunch of cool actions from shortcuts on iOS that we didn't have on the Mac.                                             |
| 10:11      | Stuff that only Apple could really address through automation.                                                            |
| 10:15      | We still have Shell scripting and AppleScript in place.                                                                  |
| 10:19      | They have not removed it.                                                                                                 |
| 10:20      | Not only have they not removed it, they've added support for it in the new shortcuts,                                     |
| 10:24      | which means Apple is kind of on board with that stuff.                                                                    |
| 10:27      | And consequently, [[Keyboard Maestro]], [[Hazel]], Shell scripting, AppleScripting, all that                                     |
| 10:34      | stuff is here, you know, for the long haul and people can go down that deep if they want                                  |
| 10:40      | to stay at the shortcuts level and make nice little shortcuts and not worry about it.                                     |
| 10:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 10:45      | And I think this is what's really great.                                                                                  |
| 10:46      | You know, they're not killing anything off, at least not yet.                                                             |
| 10:50      | I say that because some of the way that they phrase certain things makes me feel like some                                |
| 10:56      | applications may be eliminated in the future, but certainly this year, nothing is going away.                             |
| 11:02      | What are you worried about?                                                                                               |
| 11:04      | Can you give me an example?                                                                                               |
| 11:05      | Well, I'm not worried about it.                                                                                           |
| 11:06      | The fact that you can import automator actions and convert automator actions to shortcuts,                                |
| 11:11      | and you know, they've made a thing about you can convert them to shortcuts, makes me feel                                 |
| 11:17      | like maybe the hint here is don't create things in automator anymore.                                                     |
| 11:22      | Create it in shortcuts because automator.                                                                                 |
| 11:25      | I agree with you.                                                                                                         |
| 11:26      | I think automator is not long for this world.                                                                             |
| 11:28      | And that makes me feel a little sad because our friend Sal was so instrumental in making                                  |
| 11:33      | automator.                                                                                                                |
| 11:34      | But if he were here, I think he'd also say, I don't care.                                                                 |
| 11:36      | So long as automation is on the Mac, I don't care what the platform is.                                                   |
| 11:40      | And really, automator is not shell scripting.                                                                             |
| 11:43      | Automator is just like shortcuts.                                                                                         |
| 11:45      | It's a layer on top of that to make it easy to use.                                                                       |
| 11:49      | And so we aren't actually losing automation tools so much as we're losing kind of the                                     |
| 11:56      | easy shell on top of it.                                                                                                  |
| 11:59      | And although I will say that one of the arguments they've made is that, hey, we're bringing                               |
| 12:05      | all the most important automator actions over is they're not bringing all of them over.                                   |
| 12:11      | And like I've already had a couple of break, I've got this really clever one I used to                                    |
| 12:17      | watermark PDFs all the time because I'm a lawyer.                                                                         |
| 12:19      | I send out draft PDFs every day.                                                                                          |
| 12:22      | So that action still only works in automator because they did not bring the watermark                                     |
| 12:28      | action over.                                                                                                              |
| 12:29      | I submitted a ticket on it.                                                                                               |
| 12:31      | And I could actually, I think, write it in shortcuts with a layering of an image with                                     |
| 12:37      | an opacity.                                                                                                               |
| 12:38      | Yeah, image overlay.                                                                                                      |
| 12:39      | But it's not the same as watermarking.                                                                                    |
| 12:42      | You have to monkey around with things.                                                                                    |
| 12:44      | You have to go through each page of the PDF.                                                                              |
| 12:47      | You might even have to convert them to images before you can do that.                                                     |
| 12:51      | I'm not 100% sure.                                                                                                        |
| 12:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 12:53      | And if you do that, then obviously there's no built-in text anymore.                                                      |
| 12:56      | And you have to OCR things afterwards.                                                                                    |
| 12:58      | That feels like it's, I feel like maybe missing a watermark was an oversight or at the very                               |
| 13:05      | least, they're not intending on you converting everything to images first.                                                |
| 13:11      | Or either just like the Kanban board inside the shortcuts team has a card that says watermark                             |
| 13:18      | and it hasn't been converted yet.                                                                                         |
| 13:20      | It's like they haven't got to it yet.                                                                                     |
| 13:23      | So I do think that we may lose a little bit that way if they don't take it all over.                                      |
| 13:30      | But I actually really feel like they're in real good faith trying to bring over everything.                               |
| 13:35      | And I know from, we've met all these people.                                                                              |
| 13:39      | When we had the automator set up at WWC, the shortcuts team in large part was there.                                      |
| 13:43      | In fact, some of the people giving these sessions I've met at our meet up.                                                     |
| 13:46      | Yeah, I think I've definitely met both of them from the shortcuts is coming to Mac OS                                     |
| 13:52      | session Ayaka and Ian.                                                                                                    |
| 13:53      | And I mean, they're lovely people in person.                                                                              |
| 13:55      | And I'm really glad to see, you know, that they are, you know, at WWDC presenting, you                                    |
| 14:01      | know, it's online this year, but hopefully next year there will be in person as well.                                     |
| 14:05      | Because I would love to meet the entire team again and congratulate them because clearly                                  |
| 14:10      | this is a huge step.                                                                                                      |
| 14:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 14:12      | And but I do know also, like just looking at the original core workflow team, they were                                   |
| 14:18      | heavily inspired by automator.                                                                                            |
| 14:20      | I mean, they saw that.                                                                                                    |
| 14:21      | And they're like, why don't we have something like that on the iPhone?                                                    |
| 14:24      | So they built it.                                                                                                         |
| 14:25      | And now, you know, kind of it's come full circle.                                                                         |
| 14:28      | But these people who started with affection for automator are not going to torpedo automator.                             |
| 14:33      | They're going to give us, I think, everything that they possibly can and make it better.                                  |
| 14:38      | I mean, I feel like Sal didn't get enough support from Apple on Automator.                                                |
| 14:43      | I feel like if he had been kind of unleashed on this thing, we would have had a lot of                                    |
| 14:47      | these souls years ago, but, you know, it didn't happen for whatever reason.                                               |
| 14:50      | And now it's happening.                                                                                                   |
| 14:53      | And there are so many pieces of shortcuts that are easier to automate than with shell and                                 |
| 15:01      | AppleScripting, like, you know, inherent pieces.                                                                         |
| 15:04      | Like I'm always struggling when I try to do shortcuts around contacts because there's                                     |
| 15:10      | just really not a good way to do that with AppleScript and shell script.                                                 |
| 15:13      | And I know people are going to start writing me their scripts and tell me how great they                                  |
| 15:16      | are at it.                                                                                                                |
| 15:17      | And it's just like, you know, kind of the layer automation that you get with keyboard                                     |
| 15:20      | and maestro that those apps don't really work that well with contacts, but contacts on                                    |
| 15:25      | iPhone and iPad with shortcuts is like trivially easy.                                                                    |
| 15:29      | And I expect we'll be getting the same kind of, you know, ease of use over on the Mac too.                                |
| 15:35      | I mean, the other one that we talk about all the time here is Timery and you and I have                                   |
| 15:40      | struggled to come up with these goofy automations for Timery.                                                             |
| 15:45      | And like that's going to be an app on the MacBook.                                                                        |
| 15:48      | Now it is an app on the Mac.                                                                                              |
| 15:49      | You know that he's going to put all those hooks in and you're going to write very easy                                    |
| 15:53      | automation for your time tracking using shortcuts.                                                                        |
| 15:57      | Yes.                                                                                                                      |
| 15:58      | Yes, we are.                                                                                                              |
| 15:59      | And, you know, I tweeted out to ask some developers, some people I managed to ping specifically                           |
| 16:06      | a tweet is never long enough and my memory always sucks when it comes to lift stall the                                   |
| 16:10      | developers who've got either great shortcut support or make shortcuts Apple apps off the                                  |
| 16:14      | apps off the top of your head and remember their Twitter handles.                                                         |
| 16:18      | So that that that was a challenge, but I tweeted some people and a lot of people are tweeted                              |
| 16:24      | back saying, yeah, I've already got, you know, a draft build of this, but, you know, theoretically                        |
| 16:28      | running on the current macOS beta, which considering the fact that this is like two days after                            |
| 16:33      | WWDC, I was stunned.                                                                                                      |
| 16:36      | And, you know, and other people say that I'm working on our plan to do it and things like                                 |
| 16:41      | that. So I'm very excited because of course this means that, you know, we're going to                                     |
| 16:46      | have some of these apps that we already use and enjoy on, you know, on all of our platforms                               |
| 16:53      | and it looks to me based on what I've been seeing in the sessions that Apple have done                                    |
| 16:59      | a few things to make this easier and that hopefully you can use the same intense on                                       |
| 17:04      | both in both different applications, even if you have a completely separate application.                                  |
| 17:09      | So, you know, you pay, you pay for it once on the iPhone and you pay for it once on the                                   |
| 17:14      | Mac.                                                                                                                      |
| 17:15      | Theoretically, you can still have those same actions, which means that the shortcut that                                  |
| 17:19      | you run, then, you know, is the same shortcut, whichever platform, which is great because                                 |
| 17:24      | I know I wasn't able to verify if it's still like this.                                                                   |
| 17:27      | I suspect not.                                                                                                            |
| 17:28      | Things used to have different actions for things for iPad and things for iPhone.                                          |
| 17:32      | And I have a feeling if they currently do, then they won't need to do that anymore.                                       |
| 17:37      | And I have feeling they may have already fixed that anyway.                                                               |
| 17:41      | So, you know, this is great because it means even separate applications can have the same                                 |
| 17:46      | shortcut sections.                                                                                                        |
| 17:47      | So, you won't need to check, hopefully, if it's Mac, do this action.                                                      |
| 17:50      | If it's not Mac, do this other action.                                                                                    |
| 17:53      | And if it's Apple Watch, then crash and die because this, you know, this doesn't work on                                  |
| 17:58      | Apple Watch or whatever.                                                                                                  |
| 17:59      | I'm being hyperbolic.                                                                                                     |
| 18:00      | You know, there are some things that don't necessarily work on the Apple Watch the same                                   |
| 18:04      | as they don't work on the HomePod, just because, you know, it needs to go in and do this or                               |
| 18:09      | do that or whatever.                                                                                                      |
| 18:10      | But, you know, most things work everywhere.                                                                               |
| 18:13      | And a couple of my shortcuts that I've got here, it turns out a lot of my shortcuts,                                      |
| 18:18      | David, rely on third-party actions.                                                                                       |
| 18:21      | Who knew?                                                                                                                 |
| 18:22      | And so, I dug around and all of the ones that I found, which are just using macOS or shortcuts,                           |
| 18:28      | core actions, work.                                                                                                       |
| 18:30      | So, I can toggle my Wi-Fi on and off through an action in the menu bar because shortcuts                                  |
| 18:35      | is in my menu bar.                                                                                                        |
| 18:36      | I do think that, historically, setting up automation for a Mac developer was a challenge                                  |
| 18:43      | because there's two things going on.                                                                                      |
| 18:46      | First, it's a lot of work to add AppleScript support to your app.                                                         |
| 18:50      | I mean, it's a lot of work to add any kind of support to your app.                                                        |
| 18:53      | But, you know, AppleScript is a language that a lot of programmers don't like because it's                                |
| 18:59      | supposed to be more human-friendly.                                                                                       |
| 19:01      | I actually like AppleScript.                                                                                              |
| 19:03      | I'm comfortable with it, but I understand why some people don't.                                                          |
| 19:06      | So, you've got that barrier, but you also have the barrier knowing that very few users                                    |
| 19:11      | understand or have any desire to use AppleScript.                                                                         |
| 19:14      | So, it's like, am I going to add a new feature to my app that everybody can take advantage                                |
| 19:20      | of, or am I going to spend that same time building an AppleScript support for a very                                      |
| 19:24      | small subset of my users?                                                                                                 |
| 19:26      | And I think too often the answer is, well, I'm going to add the new feature.                                              |
| 19:31      | But now, with shortcuts, you're going to have a massively bigger user base that wants these                               |
| 19:39      | shortcuts.                                                                                                                |
| 19:40      | So, and frankly, Apple, I think, is putting in the time in the developer kit to make these                                |
| 19:46      | intents and these methods of using shortcuts much easier than historical AppleScript methods.                             |
| 19:53      | So, it's going to be a lower barrier and more users are going to want it.                                                 |
| 19:58      | And also, there's that thing.                                                                                             |
| 20:00      | You know whenever Apple adds a new feature, and this is a thing developers know, maybe                                    |
| 20:04      | listeners of the show don't know, but Apple adds some new feature, feature X.                                             |
| 20:08      | And, you know, let's say 50 developers really jump on that.                                                               |
| 20:12      | And at launch, they've got their apps already with feature X built into it.                                               |
| 20:17      | Well, go to the App Store and try to not see those apps because it's almost impossible.                                   |
| 20:22      | Apple is sticking those apps in front of your face, you know.                                                             |
| 20:25      | So, there's a marketing boost to them as well for adding support for this.                                                |
| 20:29      | So, I think there's a lot of good reasons for a lot of good app developers to add shortcuts                               |
| 20:34      | to their apps.                                                                                                            |
| 20:35      | And I think we'll see that you'll be surprised how many apps have really robust support for                               |
| 20:41      | shortcuts in September.                                                                                                   |
| 20:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 20:44      | And I'm hoping that, you know, we're going to see a lot of apps do this.                                                  |
| 20:47      | I know some app developers are not going to have this ready day one because they've got                                   |
| 20:52      | all of these other things that they also need to build in, you know, share play, things                                   |
| 20:56      | like that, you know, depending on the app, you know, certain features are probably more                                   |
| 21:00      | important than others to have on day one.                                                                                 |
| 21:02      | And there's a limited number of developer hours between now and whenever Apple actually                                   |
| 21:07      | releases this, because of course you don't know until the iPhone keynote.                                                 |
| 21:11      | And then, you know, it might be tomorrow, it could be Friday, it could be next week,                                      |
| 21:17      | you know, it could be today, they've done that before.                                                                    |
| 21:20      | I have seen developers having minor meltdowns on Twitter and I do not blame them because                                  |
| 21:25      | they thought they were going to be ready and they had a few more days and nope, it's today.                               |
| 21:29      | But, you know, we're going to see what happens and I'm pretty excited.                                                    |
| 21:33      | It looks like Apple have got, you know, quite a few things right here which will make it                                  |
| 21:37      | even easier.                                                                                                              |

| 23:30      | Our thanks to the Intrazone by Microsoft SharePoint for their support of the Automator's                                  |
| 23:35      | and all of Relay FM.                                                                                                      |
| 23:37      | So, you know, we've kind of been dancing around this a little bit, David, but I think it's                                |
| 23:41      | time to talk about what new stuff there is in shortcuts.                                                                  |
| 23:45      | Because obviously, you know, with shortcuts being on the Mac, they've added things kind                                   |
| 23:51      | of specifically for the Mac, but it's not just specific for the Mac.                                                      |
| 23:56      | Getting apps is clearly targeted at macOS.                                                                                |
| 24:00      | And perhaps getting on-screen content as well.                                                                            |
| 24:04      | And clearly, AppleScript and  shell script execution is also, you know, macOS stuff.                                        |
| 24:09      | But some of this stuff, like split screen apps, doesn't just work on Mac.                                                 |
| 24:13      | It also works on iPad.                                                                                                    |
| 24:15      | And I'm pretty, you know, excited about this because there's a lot that you can do with                                   |
| 24:21      | just a couple of things here.                                                                                             |
| 24:24      | And you don't need to, you know, spend hours digging around and figuring out how do I figure                              |
| 24:29      | out if these two applications are open, you just say split screen.                                                        |
| 24:32      | And even if they're not open right now, macOS opens them and boom, split screen.                                          |
| 24:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 24:38      | And it's interesting on a couple levels because window management was not something that                                  |
| 24:43      | shortcuts ever had to deal with before.                                                                                   |
| 24:45      | And they have addressed it here.                                                                                          |
| 24:48      | And it's not just split screen.                                                                                           |
| 24:50      | You can also place a window on the screen through shortcuts action.                                                       |
| 24:53      | Like you can say, as far as I could find, the available options are left half of the screen,                              |
| 24:59      | right half of the screen, top left quadrant, top right quadrant, top, or bottom left quadrant,                            |
| 25:07      | bottom right quadrant.                                                                                                    |
| 25:08      | So you've got basically six different ways you can set a window with a shortcut, which                                    |
| 25:14      | is enough for most people.                                                                                                |
| 25:15      | It's not going to give you like, moon level accuracy and allow you to put it on an 8x6                                    |
| 25:21      | grid or anything.                                                                                                         |
| 25:22      | But for most of people, I think this is going to be just fine.                                                            |
| 25:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 25:26      | And I think that's the trick, isn't it?                                                                                   |
| 25:28      | You know, shortcuts is shortcuts.                                                                                         |
| 25:30      | It's not [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                |
| 25:31      | It is not [[Hazel]].                                                                                                          |
| 25:33      | It's none of the macOS applications that we are used to using right now for automation                                    |
| 25:40      | purposes.                                                                                                                 |
| 25:41      | But it's definitely a step above Automator while still retaining most of that ease of                                     |
| 25:45      | use, which is great.                                                                                                      |
| 25:47      | I actually had a conversation with somebody at my job today about shortcuts, and he was                                   |
| 25:52      | saying that he made a shortcut at the weekend and it took him about five minutes.                                         |
| 25:56      | And now he has a phrase that he can say at his iPhone.                                                                    |
| 26:00      | And if he says it, then it sends GPS coordinates, what three words and stuff to a couple of                               |
| 26:05      | different people so that they can find him.                                                                               |
| 26:09      | What three words for people who aren't familiar is a grid square with three words assigned                                |
| 26:14      | per grid square so that people can find a very small location and find out exactly where                                  |
| 26:20      | you are instead of just I'm in, I don't know, California, which kind of, you know, saying                                 |
| 26:26      | town names can be at times.                                                                                               |
| 26:28      | And I was really impressed.                                                                                               |
| 26:29      | You know, this is somebody who, okay, he's a programmer, but at the same time, you know,                                  |
| 26:34      | this is somebody who hadn't played with shortcuts before the weekend and he created a shortcut.                           |
| 26:38      | So I'm pleased that it is accessible for people.                                                                          |
| 26:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 26:43      | So there's a couple of points I want to follow up on there.                                                               |
| 26:45      | The first is that, you know, window and file management were necessary on the Mac because                                 |
| 26:51      | that's what the Mac is good at.                                                                                           |
| 26:54      | But we're seeing that a bunch of these actions have dribbled back to the iPhone and the iPad                              |
| 26:59      | and these betas.                                                                                                          |
| 27:00      | So we got better file management automation, you know, which is, you know, I said earlier,                                |
| 27:07      | I was hesitant to get shortcuts on the Macs.                                                                              |
| 27:09      | I thought they needed to focus on the iPad and iPhone, but what happened was by going                                     |
| 27:13      | to the Mac, it gave them additional tools to bring back to the iPad and the iPhone.                                       |
| 27:18      | I mean, I was just wrong on that, on that anti, you know, shortcuts on the Mac in every                                   |
| 27:23      | possible way.                                                                                                             |
| 27:24      | But, but that's great because now we're going to talk and maybe this show or a future show                                |
| 27:28      | about all the new file management stuff you can do with shortcuts on your iPhone and iPad,                                |
| 27:33      | which wouldn't have happened if they hadn't gone to the Mac.                                                              |
| 27:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 27:37      | It is great.                                                                                                              |
| 27:38      | Specifically for people who have, you know, who are curious about the file stuff, specifically                            |
| 27:45      | you can now label files, you can move files, rename files, obviously reveal files in Finder,                              |
| 27:53      | but you can also, you know, get the parent folder and get the contents of a specific                                      |
| 27:59      | folder.                                                                                                                   |
| 28:00      | Previously, if you got the contents of a file path and it was a folder, so say, for example,                              |
| 28:06      | inside of Dropbox, you had a folder called Automators, then if you just put Automators                                    |
| 28:10      | in, in the path, then you could get everything inside the Automators folder, which is great                               |
| 28:15      | except, you know, you have to know that it was a specific thing that you have to know.                                    |
| 28:21      | And then it was get file from file path or whatever.                                                                      |
| 28:24      | And it just wasn't particularly logical.                                                                                  |
| 28:26      | Now there's a specific action to get the contents of a folder, which is great.                                            |
| 28:31      | And similarly renaming files.                                                                                             |
| 28:33      | This was quite tricky before.                                                                                             |
| 28:34      | Because people, the way that they did it, was they got the file, they saved the file,                                     |
| 28:39      | and then they deleted the original file, which was crazy works, but you shouldn't need to                                 |
| 28:44      | do that.                                                                                                                  |
| 28:45      | Like that, that's where things go wrong because then it didn't get saved.                                                 |
| 28:49      | And now you've deleted the file and that worked, saving it didn't and things like that.                                   |
| 28:54      | And, you know, it's not good.                                                                                             |
| 28:55      | So I'm really glad now that, you know, we have official actions for moving files, because                                 |
| 29:00      | again, people, the way they did that was they got the file, they saved it to the new location,                            |
| 29:05      | and then they deleted it.                                                                                                 |
| 29:06      | It's exactly the same.                                                                                                    |
| 29:07      | And now there's actions for that.                                                                                         |
| 29:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 29:09      | But saving it wasn't always where you wanted to save it because you could save it anywhere                                |
| 29:13      | in Dropbox, but on Apple's own iCloud service, you had to save it to a shortcut subfolder.                                |
| 29:18      | So like I had this crazy system where I had these subfolders in the shortcut subfolder                                    |
| 29:24      | in iCloud, and then I had [[Hazel]] on my Mac constantly watching them, like anything saved                                   |
| 29:29      | a shortcut slash Obsidian copy to my Obsidian database, anything, and, you know, and I had                                |
| 29:34      | all these weird rules that I had to like move files after I had created them via shortcuts                                |
| 29:40      | because shortcuts wouldn't let me just put it where I wanted to, to begin with.                                           |
| 29:44      | And that problem is now solved.                                                                                           |
| 29:45      | So yeah, all this stuff I really think probably stems from them having to get shortcuts on                                |
| 29:51      | the Mac.                                                                                                                  |
| 29:52      | And that's, that's good, right?                                                                                           |
| 29:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 29:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 29:57      | So just to be very clear, because I'm sure some people will be going, wait, wait, what                                    |
| 29:59      | does this mean?                                                                                                           |
| 30:00      | So you can save files from shortcuts anywhere in iCloud drive and anywhere in Dropbox.                                    |
| 30:07      | Dropbox was possible before, but now you've got anywhere in iCloud drive.                                                 |
| 30:13      | Similarly, you can get files from anywhere in iCloud drive, which means if, for example,                                  |
| 30:19      | you've been looking Obsidian going, yeah, I would really like obsidian, but you know,                                     |
| 30:24      | I'm using the iCloud sync and that means it's not really automation friendly.                                             |
| 30:27      | Well, with shortcuts, it now is.                                                                                          |
| 30:30      | So you have a whole bunch more options, which I'm sure people are, you know, not sure exactly                             |
| 30:37      | what that means yet.                                                                                                      |
| 30:38      | In some cases, in other cases, people are there running around like headless chickens                                     |
| 30:41      | going, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.                                                                                   |
| 30:44      | That was me last, last Monday, David, when, when they started announcing all this stuff                                   |
| 30:49      | and things were trickling out as I was trying on my really bad internet, which finally got                                |
| 30:54      | fixed two days later to download the betas.                                                                               |
| 30:57      | But yeah, there, there's all sorts of great things that have come, you know, previously                                   |
| 31:02      | there was an exit shortcut action.                                                                                        |
| 31:04      | It's now called stop shortcut, which is a bit more friendly, but there's also stop and                                    |
| 31:08      | output.                                                                                                                   |
| 31:09      | So if you previously had an exit shortcut action, it gets upgraded to a stop and output, but                              |
| 31:14      | there's also just a straight up stop shortcut action, which just stops.                                                   |
| 31:18      | That's it.                                                                                                                |
| 31:19      | It doesn't have a specific output or anything.                                                                            |
| 31:20      | It's just end, which is, you know, which is great.                                                                        |
| 31:25      | And there's, there's also also things, you know, focus modes.                                                             |
| 31:27      | Okay.                                                                                                                     |
| 31:28      | Let's put a pin in focus modes.                                                                                           |
| 31:29      | I want to come back to that because there's a lot to talk about.                                                          |
| 31:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 31:33      | But there's also start screensaver and things like that.                                                                  |
| 31:35      | So, you know, if I run this shortcut, then it starts my screensaver, which, you know,                                     |
| 31:40      | is exactly what you want.                                                                                                 |
| 31:41      | But iPhone and iPad don't have a screensaver, you know, you could lock them.                                              |
| 31:47      | I'm actually curious as to what that action does on my iPad.                                                              |
| 31:50      | I've not tried starting a screensaver on my iPad yet, David, have you?                                                    |
| 31:54      | Does it even exist?                                                                                                       |
| 31:55      | I'm not sure that action came over.                                                                                       |
| 31:56      | So this is, this is what's really interesting.                                                                            |
| 31:59      | Vibrate device is available.                                                                                              |
| 32:01      | The action is available on all devices now.                                                                               |
| 32:06      | So okay.                                                                                                                  |
| 32:07      | So now if I, if I look at a shortcut with start screensaver in, and I try and run it,                                     |
| 32:11      | it says it can only run on the Mac and if you try and vibrate an iPad or a Mac, it's                                      |
| 32:15      | going to tell you, no, I don't vibrate.                                                                                   |
| 32:19      | So you are going to need in some cases to use if actions to work around this for things                                   |
| 32:25      | that only work on macOS or only work on iPhone and iPad or only work on iPhone and Apple                                  |
| 32:30      | watch.                                                                                                                    |
| 32:32      | And so you'll need to use get device details.                                                                             |
| 32:34      | And I would suggest something like device model.                                                                          |
| 32:38      | There's also device is watch, which is, you know, your device is an Apple watch.                                          |
| 32:42      | And if I get the device model on this MacBook Pro, then it tells me it's a Mac, Mac with                                  |
| 32:48      | a capital M.                                                                                                              |
| 32:50      | So if it's a Mac, don't vibrate, you know.                                                                                |
| 32:52      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                            |
| 32:53      | So I mean, in this case, you'll probably want to say if it's an iPhone vibrate, I don't                                   |
| 32:58      | know if you're going to be running your shortcut on the Apple watch.                                                      |
| 33:01      | And if you will want the haptic feedback in which case you can vibrate on the Apple watch,                                |
| 33:08      | that might be a little tricky to do, you probably have to do a nested if else if, and then just                           |
| 33:15      | otherwise don't vibrate, you know, go on to the next section because, you know, Macs                                      |
| 33:20      | don't have vibration.                                                                                                     |
| 33:21      | And I don't want to do it today, but someday I want to talk about how we're using shortcuts                               |
| 33:24      | on our watches because I'm very curious how you're using yours.                                                           |
| 33:27      | Yeah, it's something I need to definitely get into more because I feel like I don't                                       |
| 33:31      | use shortcuts on my watch anywhere near as much as I should.                                                              |
| 33:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 33:35      | And there's just a ton of actions that are specific to devices, like on the Mac, if you                                   |
| 33:41      | try to run the timing device, like set an alarm, set a timer, it just gives you a message                                 |
| 33:46      | that this isn't available on your Mac, which you kind of should be, honestly, I mean, the                                 |
| 33:50      | Mac is fully capable of running a timer, you know, but yeah, but you know, we're in beta                                  |
| 33:57      | one, too.                                                                                                                 |
| 33:58      | So who knows where this is going to end up.                                                                               |
| 34:01      | But there's some actions that I'm just so happy to see on the Mac, like I talked about                                    |
| 34:04      | earlier how having one device, like one Mac, one MacBook, one of the big problems is you've                               |
| 34:10      | got to properly eject drives before you unplug it from your monitor.                                                      |
| 34:14      | There's a shortcut called eject drive, right?                                                                             |
| 34:17      | Yep.                                                                                                                      |
| 34:18      | So all these apps that are out there to help you eject drives, maybe they just got sure                                   |
| 34:22      | like by smart people who want to use shortcuts, like you could run a shortcut that says, you                              |
| 34:26      | know, you know, remove Mac and you could eject drives and close windows and do a whole bunch                              |
| 34:31      | of stuff, run that shortcut, then unplug your MacBook and take it with you.                                               |
| 34:36      | Yeah, this is great because I mean, the other thing is, is of course we have folders as                                   |
| 34:41      | well.                                                                                                                     |
| 34:42      | So if you want to stick all your Mac shortcuts in a Mac folder, then you can go ahead and                                 |
| 34:46      | do that.                                                                                                                  |
| 34:47      | But you can also choose to stick your Mac shortcuts in say a menu bar or something like that because                      |
| 34:55      | I mean, shortcuts is literally everywhere it feels like, David.                                                           |
| 34:59      | It's kind of crazy.                                                                                                       |
| 35:01      | Yes.                                                                                                                      |
| 35:02      | Let me see.                                                                                                               |
| 35:03      | I have a screenshot here from the keynote, not from the keynote, sorry, but from, from                                    |
| 35:06      | the, the presentation that you did on shortcuts coming to the Mac and I've annotated it.                                  |
| 35:12      | And there it is.                                                                                                          |
| 35:14      | So you can run shortcuts.                                                                                                 |
| 35:15      | This is specific to the Mac, Siri, app, menu bar, keyboard shortcuts, spotlight, your dock,                               |
| 35:22      | finder, and I believe the touch bar as well.                                                                              |
| 35:26      | I've not got around to putting any shortcuts in my touch bar yet.                                                         |
| 35:28      | I don't know what ones I would run in my touch bar, but this is, yeah, this is pretty crazy.                              |
| 35:34      | You know, all of these actions are available to us and not only are all of these actions                                  |
| 35:38      | available to us, the vast majority of them work regardless of your device.                                                |
| 35:43      | And you know, it's, it's great that everything is just there and can be run anywhere.                                     |
| 35:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 35:52      | And we've talked about how it supports traditional automation.                                                            |
| 35:57      | There's a trifecta of commands, run shell script, run AppleScript and run JavaScript                                     |
| 36:03      | for Mac automation, which are the three traditional ways we created advanced automation on the                            |
| 36:08      | Mac.                                                                                                                      |
| 36:09      | All of that can be run from right inside your shortcuts.                                                                  |
| 36:13      | So while shortcuts, as we've said, is kind of the basic language of automation, if you've                                 |
| 36:17      | got an advanced AppleScript and you just decide to embed it in a shortcut step, your                                     |
| 36:23      | shortcut just got very powerful.                                                                                          |
| 36:26      | Yeah, it did.                                                                                                             |
| 36:28      | And speaking of shortcuts getting more powerful, we've still got actions like running shell                               |
| 36:33      | scripts you can run on your device, but you can still run a script over SSH that of course                                |
| 36:37      | works everywhere.                                                                                                         |
| 36:39      | And you can also, and when you want to try any of these scripting actions, the first                                      |
| 36:45      | time you do it, you'll, you'll be prompted if you want to allow scripting actions.                                        |
| 36:49      | And this is in the preferences of shortcuts then, if you say yes, where you need to take                                  |
| 36:53      | a box that enables or allow running scripts, which says when enabled, the, the actions                                    |
| 36:58      | run AppleScript, run shell script, run JavaScript for Mac automation, run JavaScript on web page                          |
| 37:03      | and, and I can't read the rest of it because it's, it's running out of the box.                                           |
| 37:09      | And that's a box that I need to file through, through the feedback app, but basically it's                                |
| 37:14      | a checkbox that you need to turn on.                                                                                      |
| 37:15      | And there's a couple of other checkboxes here as well.                                                                    |
| 37:18      | So you can allow sharing large amounts of data, allow deleting without confirmation and                                   |
| 37:23      | allow deleting large amounts of data.                                                                                     |
| 37:26      | Which means that, you know, you can then, you know, have shortcuts, just delete things                                    |
| 37:33      | without you having to confirm.                                                                                            |
| 37:35      | If you're going to do that, please test your shortcut.                                                                    |
| 37:38      | I feel like I shouldn't need to say that, but please test your shortcuts before you,                                      |
| 37:43      | you delete things without confirmation.                                                                                   |
| 37:45      | Like make sure that you're definitely getting the right actions there or getting the right                                |
| 37:49      | files, reminders, calendar events, whatever it is, make sure you're getting the right                                     |
| 37:53      | things before you, you go ahead and delete everything and if you have that confirmation                                   |
| 38:00      | turned off.                                                                                                               |
| 38:01      | Remember when the workflow first got purchased by Apple and everybody was worried that would                              |
| 38:04      | be the end of it.                                                                                                         |
| 38:05      | You know, they'd break up the band and that would be in, I mean, who would imagine now                                    |
| 38:08      | we're getting shortcut actions like connect to server, you know, delete without confirmation.                             |
| 38:15      | One of this would have been possible if workflow had not been purchased by Apple, you know,                               |
| 38:19      | this never would have happened.                                                                                           |
| 38:22      | Although I do wish they would get rid of those automation confirmation dialog boxes, that                                 |
| 38:27      | was kind of on my wish list for this year and that didn't really happen.                                                  |
| 38:30      | So we're still getting bubble pop-ups when we rent some of our more complex automation.                                   |
| 38:36      | And these pop-ups have kind of got a little bit more aggressive, I've noticed, at least                                   |
| 38:39      | the first couple of times they happen, where I have one particular automation that I run                                  |
| 38:46      | in the morning and it creates a bunch of widgets using widget pack.                                                       |
| 38:49      | And the way it does this is it runs a whole bunch of shortcuts in a folder.                                               |
| 38:55      | And so for every shortcut it ran, the first couple of times I was just clicking an allow                                  |
| 38:59      | button because I was half asleep because this triggers when my alarm goes off and when                                    |
| 39:06      | I stop it.                                                                                                                |
| 39:08      | And then I start, you know, I actually had my glasses on one morning and I was vaguely                                    |
| 39:12      | awake because I'd already woken up shortly before my alarm went off.                                                      |
| 39:15      | And I was looking at it and it turns out there's an always allow button.                                                  |
| 39:19      | So if I just hit the always allow button, then that would have been much easier.                                          |
| 39:23      | But basically, you know, the first couple of times that you run things on the new iOS,                                    |
| 39:29      | assuming nothing changes, iPadOS as well, of course, and maybe macOS, you might have                                      |
| 39:34      | to hit a couple of allow dialogues per shortcut depending on what it's doing and how it's                                 |
| 39:40      | doing things.                                                                                                             |
| 39:41      | Just because, you know, they've added in a bit of extra security, but I'm hoping that                                     |
| 39:45      | this means that by adding some extra stuff in this year, they're going to be able to                                      |
| 39:49      | relax some other things next year.                                                                                        |
| 39:52      | But we did see some automation improvements, David.                                                                       |
| 39:58      | This episode of the Automator's Podcast is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                                  |
| 40:03      | Go to expressvpn.com/automators for high speed, secure and anonymous VPN services.                                  |
| 40:09      | Not only that, when you sign up at that link, you get an extra three months for free.                                     |
| 40:14      | There's a lot of VPN services out there, but you need to find a VPN service you can trust.                                |
| 40:20      | And that's why I use ExpressVPN.                                                                                          |
| 40:22      | I would not accept a VPN sponsor that I didn't trust and ExpressVPN is really good.                                       |
| 40:29      | Specifically, ExpressVPN doesn't log your activity online.                                                                |
| 40:33      | A lot of cheap or free VPNs make money by selling your data to advertisers.                                               |
| 40:37      | But ExpressVPN doesn't do this.                                                                                           |
| 40:39      | They even developed a technology called Trusted Server that makes their VPN servers incapable                             |
| 40:45      | of storing any data.                                                                                                      |
| 40:47      | Instead of using hard drives, they use RAM, so all data is wiped whenever the servers                                     |
| 40:51      | are powered down.                                                                                                         |
| 40:52      | And ExpressVPN is fast because it uses Lightway, a new VPN protocol they engineered to make                               |
| 40:58      | user speeds faster than ever.                                                                                             |
| 41:00      | If you've tried other VPNs, you'll know they can sometimes slow your connection.                                          |
| 41:04      | But ExpressVPN is always blazing fast and lets you stream video and HD quality with                                       |
| 41:10      | zero buffering.                                                                                                           |
| 41:12      | And it's super easy to use.                                                                                               |
| 41:13      | There's no technical skills needed.                                                                                       |
| 41:16      | Just fire the app and tap one button to connect.                                                                          |
| 41:19      | Kids, grandparents, tech savvy or not, could use it.                                                                      |
| 41:22      | And seeing it, the Verge and many other tech journals rate ExpressVPN their number one                                    |
| 41:27      | VPN in the world.                                                                                                         |
| 41:30      | It's their commitment to privacy, speed and usability that brought me in as a customer                                    |
| 41:36      | to ExpressVPN.                                                                                                            |
| 41:37      | I renewed just a little while ago and I've been renewing for years.                                                       |
| 41:41      | I love ExpressVPN and I use it all the time.                                                                              |
| 41:45      | Even during COVID when I was staying home, I still didn't want my cable provider to have                                  |
| 41:49      | all my data.                                                                                                              |
| 41:50      | I just felt like it was weird.                                                                                            |
| 41:51      | So I've been using ExpressVPN frequently.                                                                                 |
| 41:55      | So protect yourself with the VPN that I use and trust.                                                                    |

| 42:19      | All right, before the ad break, you were teasing us about some things that they added.                                    |
| 42:24      | What are you talking about, Rose?                                                                                         |
| 42:26      | I'm talking about focus mode, David.                                                                                      |
| 42:28      | You put a pin in it earlier, I'm pulling that pin out where we're diving into focus mode                                  |
| 42:32      | because focus mode is, A, going to be a huge productivity booster for so many people and                                  |
| 42:39      | B, oh my gosh, so many automations.                                                                                       |
| 42:42      | I can't keep the excitement out of my voice because you can have automations run when you                                 |
| 42:48      | turn focus mode on and you can have automations turn focus mode on.                                                       |
| 42:53      | It's built into settings, a bunch of these automations with focus modes.                                                  |
| 42:59      | For example, you can have, you know, home screens change and so on and no, this is a                                      |
| 43:05      | shortcut thing.                                                                                                           |
| 43:06      | This is custom pages of your home screen and this works on iPhone and iPad to be clear                                    |
| 43:11      | for people.                                                                                                               |
| 43:13      | Tie that into changing your watch face and wow, you're going to have a great time.                                        |
| 43:20      | You can also, you know, inside of the settings for the focus mode.                                                        |
| 43:24      | You can have the focus mode turn on automatically from times, locations, apps, et cetera.                                 |
| 43:32      | I believe locations will need a confirmation the same as everything else does, but I'm                                    |
| 43:38      | not 100% certain.                                                                                                         |
| 43:40      | But there's also smart activation as well, which is pretty cool.                                                          |
| 43:46      | And so I'm looking forward to seeing what people do with this because there's so much                                     |
| 43:52      | that you can do with a focus mode that you couldn't do anywhere else and it sinks between                                 |
| 43:57      | your devices.                                                                                                             |
| 43:59      | So if I turn on focus mode on my Apple, on my, on my iPhone, it sinks.                                                    |
| 44:04      | It's then on my Mac.                                                                                                      |
| 44:05      | It's on my iPad.                                                                                                          |
| 44:06      | It's on all of my devices.                                                                                                |
| 44:07      | I put my iPhone into do not disturb the other day and everything was quiet for my podcast                                 |
| 44:12      | recording, except for my M1 Mac.                                                                                          |
| 44:15      | And this is great.                                                                                                        |
| 44:16      | Usually, you know, there's an iPad somewhere that I've forgotten to put on silence.                                       |
| 44:20      | No, it's just, it does it for everything.                                                                                 |
| 44:23      | And this is great.                                                                                                        |
| 44:25      | It is, um, talk about a, I don't think Apple could have made a new feature that pushes                                    |
| 44:32      | all my buttons better than focus mode.                                                                                    |
| 44:35      | I mean, it's got tons of automation, which we're going to go and do today.                                                |
| 44:39      | It is definitely a Mac power user thing and I have a podcast called focus.                                                |
| 44:43      | So I mean, I'm not sure what they could have done better, but, but yeah, so focus is this                                 |
| 44:48      | idea that where you can, you know, I've talked a lot on this show and I'm like power users                                |
| 44:55      | about what I call contextual computing, which is like my little hobby horse of the last                                   |
| 44:59      | year of the idea that when you sit at your computer, that the computer should arrange                                     |
| 45:05      | itself for you to do your hard work, you know, and this is part, you know, productivity,                                  |
| 45:11      | but it's also really part automation.                                                                                     |
| 45:13      | You know, you want the ability that your computer anticipates what you're going to do and sets                            |
| 45:18      | you up for success to do that and doesn't give you all the distractions that computers                                    |
| 45:22      | can give you.                                                                                                             |
| 45:23      | And that's what this is.                                                                                                  |
| 45:24      | You pick a mode, like for an example, podcasting is one of my modes.                                                      |
| 45:29      | And when I turn podcasting on as a mode, um, it does a bunch of different things.                                         |
| 45:35      | First of all, it, it limits the people that can contact me.                                                               |
| 45:41      | And the way focus mode works is it builds this wall.                                                                      |
| 45:43      | I mean, it doesn't start with saying everybody can contact you, figure out the people who                                 |
| 45:48      | can't contact you.                                                                                                        |
| 45:49      | It says, no, focus is just the opposite.                                                                                  |
| 45:51      | It says nobody can contact you, figure out the people that you're going to let through                                    |
| 45:54      | the wall.                                                                                                                 |
| 45:56      | And like in podcasting, it's just Rosemary, Steven, and Mike and my wife, you know, the,                                  |
| 46:02      | my three podcast partners and, and my wife and anybody else who texts me while I'm recording,                             |
| 46:09      | I just don't see it.                                                                                                      |
| 46:11      | And it's so great not to be interrupted by a client or some, you know, just some silly                                    |
| 46:16      | text message that comes through while I'm sitting here trying to do the hard work of                                      |
| 46:20      | making a good podcast.                                                                                                    |
| 46:22      | And then you can also decide which apps can notify you.                                                                   |
| 46:26      | And like in this case, it would probably be zoom and some of the other apps I used to                                     |
| 46:29      | make the show, but nothing else.                                                                                          |
| 46:31      | And so this is great.                                                                                                     |
| 46:33      | But as an automator, there's so many layers you can add onto it, like Rose was talking                                    |
| 46:37      | about.                                                                                                                    |
| 46:38      | You can set on your iPhone and iPad a home screen custom to each focus mode.                                              |
| 46:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 46:45      | Like yesterday, we, um, I took a day off.                                                                                 |
| 46:47      | My wife and I went and spent the day at Disney's California Adventure, one of the theme parks                             |
| 46:51      | here in Anaheim, and I've created a Disneyland focus.                                                                     |
| 46:55      | And when I get to Disneyland, it did give me a confirmation, by the way, it turned on.                                    |
| 47:00      | And then my home screen for the day had like a battery widget and, you know, just the stuff,                              |
| 47:06      | the weather and the stuff I need, and the Disneyland app, the stuff I need on my home                                     |
| 47:10      | screen when I'm at Disneyland and the other home screen went away.                                                        |
| 47:14      | And yeah, I didn't get bothered by their stuff.                                                                           |
| 47:17      | And it's just really great.                                                                                               |
| 47:19      | But I mean, as Rosemary was saying, this is so automation, like friendly, like you can                                    |
| 47:25      | set focus modes with a shortcut.                                                                                          |
| 47:29      | So you could create a shortcut that you could tap on your watch and say, okay, I'm going                                  |
| 47:33      | into a meeting, set up meeting mode, and then your, your do not disturb gets turned on for                                |
| 47:38      | most people except the key people that you carve out the home screen on your phone changes,                               |
| 47:43      | the home screen on your iPad changes.                                                                                     |
| 47:45      | I mean, all this stuff just happens.                                                                                      |
| 47:47      | I mean, this is the beauty of automation and it's not that difficult to set it up.                                        |
| 47:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 47:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 47:54      | It really is.                                                                                                             |
| 47:55      | And I love the fact that focus mode.                                                                                      |
| 47:57      | So, uh, I'm just going to have a quick walkthrough of the default focus mode.                                             |
| 48:01      | So do not disturb still exists.                                                                                           |
| 48:04      | And that button in the control centre is kind of split into two now where, uh, there's a                                  |
| 48:08      | circle on the left hand side of it, where if you tap that, it will just toggle do not                                     |
| 48:12      | disturb on and either off if it's on, or if there's a focus mode on, it will toggle the                                   |
| 48:16      | focus mode off.                                                                                                           |
| 48:18      | If you tap on the right side of it, then you can choose between focus modes.                                              |
| 48:22      | So there are some default ones, which people might be familiar with, which include driving,                               |
| 48:27      | sleep, um, and there's also work and personal, uh, which are new and you, you, you go through                             |
| 48:33      | and you set them up.                                                                                                      |
| 48:34      | And if you haven't set it up, then it shows up in the settings with a set up option.                                      |
| 48:38      | Um, and it walks you through the things that David was saying, you know, which people do                                  |
| 48:42      | want to let through, which apps do you want to let through, so on and so forth, setting                                   |
| 48:45      | things up automatically and so on.                                                                                        |
| 48:47      | Um, and then you can add another five focus modes.                                                                        |
| 48:52      | So you can go fairly nuts with this.                                                                                      |
| 48:55      | Um, I mean, I say fairly nuts because at the end of the day, you've got work personal,                                    |
| 49:00      | um, and then five others that you can customise and work.                                                                 |
| 49:03      | Obviously you can, you can change to mean whatever you want.                                                              |
| 49:06      | Work and personal can't be renamed.                                                                                       |
| 49:08      | The other five you can give any icon, any name to that you like.                                                          |
| 49:12      | You can, you can turn on dimming your lock screen and things like that.                                                   |
| 49:16      | Um, there's these time sensitive notifications.                                                                           |
| 49:19      | You can allow them to come through and so on.                                                                             |
| 49:21      | Um, and this, you know, this is really great as far as I'm concerned.                                                     |
| 49:26      | I, I know I, I wear lots of different hats, um, but I'm pretty certain I can boil it down                                 |
| 49:32      | to, you know, the day job, which is work personal, which is going to be, I'm hanging out with                             |
| 49:37      | people, be that friends or family, and then five other things, one of which is already                                    |
| 49:41      | assigned podcasting.                                                                                                      |
| 49:42      | No surprise there.                                                                                                        |
| 49:43      | Oh, Rose, where did you get this limitation for five?                                                                     |
| 49:46      | Where do you see that?                                                                                                    |
| 49:47      | Because I can't add any more when I've added five.                                                                        |
| 49:49      | Okay.                                                                                                                     |
| 49:50      | I've added 12, so I'm not sure.                                                                                           |
| 49:52      | Wow.                                                                                                                      |
| 49:53      | Okay.                                                                                                                     |
| 49:54      | This is crazy because I've been trying for days, like my plus button is just gone.                                        |
| 49:59      | It doesn't help that every time I, I put my, uh, my Apple watch near my iPad or my iPhone,                                |
| 50:04      | I get a notification at the top saying, would you like to use this device as a keyboard                                   |
| 50:07      | for your Apple watch?                                                                                                     |
| 50:08      | No.                                                                                                                       |
| 50:09      | Um, it's just popped up again, but I, I definitely can't add more than five.                                              |
| 50:14      | Okay.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:15      | Well, I'm going to, I'm going to have to look into that, David.                                                           |
| 50:17      | Maybe, maybe I've got a bug or maybe you've got a bug on some of yours, go disappear or                                   |
| 50:21      | I'm going to get the ability to, uh, to create these, but I've been adding them from multiple                             |
| 50:26      | devices as well.                                                                                                          |
| 50:27      | I've added them on iPad, iPhone, and Mac.                                                                                 |
| 50:29      | So I don't know.                                                                                                          |
| 50:30      | Okay.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:31      | Well, my plus button is disappeared on all of my devices.                                                                 |
| 50:33      | That's the thing.                                                                                                         |
| 50:34      | Weird.                                                                                                                    |
| 50:35      | Cause, cause in, in settings, focus, there should be a plus in the top right and I definitely                             |
| 50:40      | don't have one.                                                                                                           |
| 50:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:42      | And I don't know that I added them from that.                                                                             |
| 50:45      | I'll have to, I'll have to go back.                                                                                       |
| 50:46      | I mean, we're in beta one, so we're all learning at the same time.                                                        |
| 50:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:51      | I mean, at the moment, I think it is limited to five, which seems like a reasonable limitation,                           |
| 50:54      | but if they can remove that entirely for everybody, that would be great.                                                  |
| 50:57      | Why would there need to be any limitation?                                                                                |
| 50:59      | Honestly.                                                                                                                 |
| 51:00      | I mean, honestly, I will do randomly decide limitations on, on our behalf, which people                                   |
| 51:04      | are not always that happy with.                                                                                           |
| 51:06      | Cause I was, I was thinking I would add one actually for each podcast, like recording                                     |
| 51:11      | automators.                                                                                                               |
| 51:12      | That's what I wanted to do, but then I found out it was five and I thought, no, I'm, I'm                                  |
| 51:15      | going to need more for this.                                                                                              |
| 51:18      | So we'll see.                                                                                                             |
| 51:20      | Well, we will look into that and report back.                                                                             |
| 51:22      | Hopefully that, hopefully my 12 is, is not the anomaly, but the, um, either way, uh,                                      |
| 51:28      | it's very powerful and the automation in is very simple.                                                                  |
| 51:31      | There is a focus, it's a new action in, in shortcuts, you know, start a focus and, um,                                    |
| 51:37      | the automation out, I feel like could be better.                                                                          |
| 51:40      | Um, like I would like to trigger shortcuts out of a focus mode unless I'm missing something.                              |
| 51:46      | So you can.                                                                                                               |
| 51:47      | So inside of short in the inside of the shortcuts app, this is much like, uh, this is an automation                       |
| 51:53      | trigger.                                                                                                                  |
| 51:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 51:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 51:56      | It's an automation trigger and you can turn off ask him running.                                                          |
| 51:57      | Um, and actually one of the first things I did was create, um, a shortcut for this                                        |
| 52:01      | because I've set my work to be every Monday to Friday, but I don't necessarily work every                                 |
| 52:07      | Monday to Friday, I could have a bank holiday, I could have a day off.                                                    |
| 52:11      | I don't want to be turning my automation off to turn my focus mode on.                                                    |
| 52:15      | That feels like it kind of defeats the point, but what I do want to do is say, Hey, if it's                               |
| 52:21      | a holiday or I am on holiday, then turn my focus mode back off, please.                                                   |
| 52:26      | Um, so turning the focus mode on triggers a shortcut, which checks whether or not it's                                    |
| 52:30      | a holiday day or a vacation day.                                                                                          |
| 52:32      | Um, and then it turns the focus mode off again, if it is one of those, and otherwise it just                              |
| 52:38      | does nothing.                                                                                                             |
| 52:39      | Um, and so this now happens automatically whenever, uh, my, my work mode comes on, which                                  |
| 52:45      | means when the next, uh, bank holiday comes up at the end of August, uh, I will, uh, you                                  |
| 52:51      | know, hopefully see it toggle on and toggle back off.                                                                     |
| 52:54      | Um, or maybe it just won't turn on at all because it'll realise it turns off that day.                                    |
| 52:58      | Another thing I'd really like them to see them add, uh, and I'm going to submit a tick,                                   |
| 53:02      | and I just haven't got around to it yet is a separate shortcut action just to set home                                    |
| 53:07      | screen.                                                                                                                   |
| 53:08      | Cause now that you have the ability to set the home screen, I want to do that automatically                               |
| 53:12      | without entering a focus mode.                                                                                            |
| 53:14      | Like what if I just want to get my health apps on my screen, but I don't need to, I don't                                 |
| 53:19      | need to deal with it.                                                                                                     |
| 53:20      | It doesn't affect notifications and access to me, but I just want to be able to put my,                                   |
| 53:25      | my home screen with all my health data on it.                                                                             |
| 53:27      | You know, I'd like to be able to do that.                                                                                 |
| 53:30      | This is something I was looking at as well because I was thinking, oh, I could create                                     |
| 53:32      | a focus mode for travel, but the problem is, is when I'm traveling, I'm, I'm not necessarily                              |
| 53:37      | going to know in advance where notifications are going to come from to be useful.                                         |
| 53:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 53:42      | Um, I want all the notifications from everywhere because airlines can email me.                                           |
| 53:46      | It could be the flighty app tells me something.                                                                           |
| 53:48      | It could be tripped.                                                                                                      |
| 53:49      | It tells me something.                                                                                                    |
| 53:50      | It could be that my friend texts me and goes, Hey, I heard this thing because they have                                   |
| 53:55      | a friend of a friend of a friend who works in air traffic control or whatever.                                            |
| 53:58      | Um, you know, it, it, it's one of those things where I had the last thing I want to do is                                 |
| 54:03      | be limiting my notifications when traveling, but I absolutely want different home screens.                                |
| 54:09      | No doubt about it.                                                                                                        |
| 54:10      | And there's a couple of ways you could do that.                                                                           |
| 54:11      | One would be, um, and the way I describe focus earlier is the way it should be.                                           |
| 54:16      | It builds the wall.                                                                                                       |
| 54:17      | Then you make holes for the people you want to let through, but there could be another                                    |
| 54:20      | setting button that just says let them all through, you know, and, and there'll be occasions                              |
| 54:26      | where you have a focus mode where that makes sense.                                                                       |
| 54:28      | Um, or like I said, just let us automate which screen is, you know, the home screen and turn                              |
| 54:34      | them off and on through via automation and just leave it out of focus mode entirely,                                      |
| 54:39      | particularly if there's only five of them that you're allowed to add.                                                     |
| 54:42      | Um, and I think that would work.                                                                                          |
| 54:44      | I mean, the other way you do it, and all you do is you long press on the, the home screen                                 |
| 54:49      | buttons at the bottom of your iOS device and then you tap it again and you, you can literally                             |
| 54:52      | manually turn them off and on, but we're automators.                                                                      |
| 54:55      | That's like, that's for, that's for, uh, monkeys.                                                                         |
| 54:58      | We want, we want to automate this stuff, right?                                                                           |
| 55:00      | We don't want to be sitting there like a monkey tapping on our phone to turn screens off and                              |
| 55:04      | on.                                                                                                                       |
| 55:05      | Hmm.                                                                                                                      |
| 55:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:08      | It would be much better if we, we have more options.                                                                      |
| 55:10      | Um, I would also love it.                                                                                                 |
| 55:12      | Um, and I'm going to file some feedback on this.                                                                          |
| 55:14      | If I could say, Hey, let anybody in this group or this group through, because I have a group                              |
| 55:19      | of a, it's called favourite contacts.                                                                                      |
| 55:22      | Um, and this is not related to the favourites feature in iOS.                                                              |
| 55:25      | It's a group that I created myself, but it's basically a very small group of people who                                   |
| 55:30      | I would always like to be able to contact me.                                                                             |
| 55:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:33      | I would love to just select that group.                                                                                   |
| 55:35      | Similarly, for work, it would be great if I could select the work address book as people                                  |
| 55:39      | who are able to get in touch with me.                                                                                     |
| 55:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:42      | But when I'm working, everybody I work with needs to be able to get in touch with me and                                  |
| 55:46      | I, it would be great if I could just say everybody in this context, uh, you know, group, uh,                              |
| 55:52      | which gets updated automatically because it's exchange.                                                                   |
| 55:55      | Um, so, um, you know, they, they might have to build in some extra work for that, but                                     |
| 55:59      | I'm definitely going to file that as feedback because I feel like especially work wise, you're                            |
| 56:04      | not going to want to go through and go, yes, my boss is allowed to contact me, but this                                   |
| 56:08      | colleague who never shares their biscuits is not allowed to contact me.                                                   |
| 56:11      | Uh, biscuits are cookies for the Americans.                                                                               |
| 56:14      | Um, uh, so, uh, especially if it's cookies, they need to share cookies.                                                   |
| 56:17      | Um, anyway, um, you know, it would be good if everything could just do that.                                              |
| 56:21      | I just wrote about that last week in MacSparky.                                                                          |
| 56:23      | Same thing.                                                                                                               |
| 56:24      | Contact groups.                                                                                                           |
| 56:25      | Like I want to make a focus group where clients can get a hold of me.                                                     |
| 56:29      | Going through with the current system, I would have to go through and select each client                                  |
| 56:33      | individually and add them.                                                                                                |
| 56:35      | And you can't even search for clients either.                                                                             |
| 56:37      | So I was trying that just now.                                                                                            |
| 56:39      | I tried searching for sparks as in David Sparks.                                                                          |
| 56:42      | No, I had, I had to use the, the, the, um, alphabet, uh, scroll on the right hand side.                                   |
| 56:48      | A little tip for people who don't know, by the way, if you drag on that, then you, you                                    |
| 56:51      | drag down between the letters.                                                                                            |
| 56:53      | Um, and so that allowed me to get to S very quickly and I rise and needed to go to T and                                  |
| 56:57      | then scroll back upwards from there because sparks is closer to T than it is, you know,                                   |
| 57:02      | um, the letter for, for in the alphabet are, uh, there we go.                                                             |
| 57:06      | Um, so, uh, yeah, I, I had to do that.                                                                                    |
| 57:09      | Uh, which, you know, it works, but it, it would be better if I could just select a group.                                 |
| 57:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 57:14      | And like if you had a client group, when you add a new person to that group, they're                                      |
| 57:17      | automatically added, you don't have to go and manually re-add them.                                                       |
| 57:20      | And then when you have multiple focuses, like my nuclear family gets through in almost all                                |
| 57:26      | of my focuses.                                                                                                            |
| 57:27      | If my kids or my wife texts me, I need to know, you know how many times I've gone through                                 |
| 57:31      | the process now of selecting them and new focuses?                                                                        |
| 57:35      | I'm guessing as you've created 12 and there are four default ones, that's going to be                                     |
| 57:40      | 16 times that you've done that.                                                                                           |
| 57:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 57:43      | So it's nuts.                                                                                                             |
| 57:44      | Um, but yeah, I mean, we're power users.                                                                                  |
| 57:47      | So of course we have a list of things we want added, but I think overall this focus                                       |
| 57:50      | mode is really great and I think for automators, it is something that can really help you                                 |
| 57:57      | work on that contextual compute, uh, like Rose, I love that it's distributed across all devices.                          |
| 58:03      | It's sad to me because my podcast machine, the one I record podcasts is the one that                                      |
| 58:07      | it doesn't get it because that'll be the last one to get the update and, um, it'll be months.                             |
| 58:12      | So, um, it's just, uh, that's a bummer, but, but I mean, you can see where this is going                                  |
| 58:18      | and, and I love it.                                                                                                       |
| 58:20      | Yes.                                                                                                                      |
| 58:21      | I really love it too.                                                                                                     |
| 58:23      | And I saw, um, somebody posting, I can't remember who it was and I've, I've not got the link                              |
| 58:28      | to the post.                                                                                                              |
| 58:29      | If I can find it again, um, then I'll link it.                                                                            |
| 58:31      | It was a, the shortcut subreddit, somebody has realised that through the combination                                      |
| 58:36      | of focus mode and push cut, you can use Zapier to trigger, uh, push cut on, on your, on an                                |
| 58:45      | iPhone server, for example, and then that can turn on a focus mode, which then spreads                                    |
| 58:50      | to all of your devices and can run a shortcut on each of your individual devices through                                  |
| 58:55      | those automations without you having to confirm it in advance, which means that all of your                               |
| 59:01      | devices now can do stuff.                                                                                                 |
| 59:04      | Like it's kind of mind boggling to think, you know, that they can do all of these things.                                 |
| 59:08      | Uh, but I'm, I'm extremely happy with it.                                                                                 |
| 59:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 59:12      | And I would really like to see them add, um, focus mode buttons to the Apple watch, um,                                   |
| 59:19      | which I have not figured out how to do yet.                                                                               |
| 59:22      | I mean, I can do it via automation with a shortcut, but, um, it would be cool if like,                                    |
| 59:28      | you know, we had a very easy way to trigger focuses, even just with the Apple watch, because                              |
| 59:32      | that's all you need.                                                                                                      |
| 59:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 59:34      | So, um, if I tap, that's the wrong button, uh, this is kind of tricky.                                                    |
| 59:39      | If I tap, if I tap, so if you swipe up from a watch face, David, and you find the do not                                  |
| 59:44      | disturb moon, if you tap on that, it does show me the different focus modes that I've                                     |
| 59:48      | got.                                                                                                                      |
| 59:49      | Oh, it's already there.                                                                                                   |
| 59:50      | So you, you've got your watch running the new beta.                                                                       |
| 59:53      | Yes.                                                                                                                      |
| 59:54      | Yes, I do.                                                                                                                |
| 59:55      | I also have 15% battery life.                                                                                             |
| 59:57      | So ask me again how that's going.                                                                                         |
| 59:59      | Uh, I do not recommend people run the watchOS beta.                                                                       |
| 01:00:02   | I made a stupid mistake.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:03   | I was playing with SwiftUI and I wrote a watchOS application.                                                             |
| 01:00:07   | Oh, you know what, Rose?                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:08   | I'm installing the beta tonight that, that, for that reason.                                                              |
| 01:00:11   | Don't do it, David.                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:12   | I'm doing it.                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:13   | I'm going to do it.                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:14   | Because your battery life will suck.                                                                                      |
| 01:00:15   | So badly.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:16   | My battery life already sucks.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:17   | My watch is like three years old, so it'll just be worse.                                                                 |
| 01:00:19   | Oh, okay.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:20   | Um, I mean, you're, you're going to get like five minutes out of it if you're lucky.                                      |
| 01:00:24   | Um, also it keeps waking up all of my other devices because anytime I put my Apple Watch                                  |
| 01:00:30   | near an iPad or an iPhone, they light up and say Apple Watch keyboard input, enter text                                   |
| 01:00:36   | on your Apple Watch using, sorry, I need to move it back again because I moved it further                                 |
| 01:00:40   | away because this is annoying me.                                                                                         |
| 01:00:41   | And now the notification doesn't show.                                                                                    |
| 01:00:43   | Basically, you can use your iPhone and iPad to type into your Apple Watch, which I'm not                                  |
| 01:00:47   | 100% certain I understand the utility of, uh, for, uh, an average user, perhaps, uh,                                      |
| 01:00:52   | for accessibility purposes, it makes sense.                                                                               |
| 01:00:55   | Um, uh, but then why wouldn't you just pick up your iPhone to do the action instead?                                      |
| 01:01:00   | Either way, um, this is slightly, uh, frustrating.                                                                        |
| 01:01:04   | Uh, yes, press the type.                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:06   | And then if I tap on notification, it's kind of like the Apple TV remote where you can                                    |
| 01:01:11   | then type onto the Apple TV from your iPhone or your iPad, except it's slow and it comes                                  |
| 01:01:15   | up with connecting to start with.                                                                                         |
| 01:01:18   | Well, I, uh, I love focus modes.                                                                                          |
| 01:01:21   | I think it's great and it, even as it's shipping, I'm very happy with it.                                                 |
| 01:01:25   | I would like to, we, we've already kind of raised some things.                                                            |
| 01:01:28   | We'd like to see them fixed with it, but, um, this is exactly what I want.                                                |
| 01:01:32   | I want to be able to have my computers set themselves up for me automatically for me                                      |
| 01:01:37   | to do the hard work and like when I hit, you know, legal work focus, I get a set of apps                                  |
| 01:01:44   | and services and, and accounts on my screen that matter to that.                                                          |
| 01:01:49   | And I love it.                                                                                                            |
| 01:01:50   | I'm just very happy with this.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:51   | And this is something that everybody can use.                                                                             |
| 01:01:53   | I hope a lot of people kind of find religion with this stuff because I think you can really                               |
| 01:01:56   | make a difference on staying on target and getting your hard work done so you can go                                      |
| 01:02:01   | and enjoy the rest of your life.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:04   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Tech Talk, a podcast from the folks at                                    |
| 01:02:07   | Hewlett Packard Enterprise.                                                                                               |
| 01:02:09   | I love finding new shows to listen to, especially when they're short, but incredibly interesting.                         |
| 01:02:14   | And Tech Talk is a show that talks you through HPE news, tech insights and world class innovations.                       |
| 01:02:19   | I recently listened to the episode on Walt Disney Studios and their experiments with                                      |
| 01:02:24   | AI and machine learning.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:26   | Of course, I used to work for Disney as did David, so anything with Disney in the title                                   |
| 01:02:30   | definitely captures my attention.                                                                                         |
| 01:02:32   | But in particular, I found it interesting how they're using technology and specifically                                   |
| 01:02:36   | AI and so on in the realms of visual effects because who wouldn't find that interesting?                                  |
| 01:02:42   | I think all of you would.                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:44   | And if you want to listen to, you can expect some other topics like how to tackle issues                                  |
| 01:02:48   | when it comes to high performance computing, the future of technology, data measurement                                   |
| 01:02:52   | and disruptive software ecosystems and AI, and even supercomputing aboard the International                               |
| 01:02:58   | Space Station.                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:59   | And the show takes you straight to the source, interviewing some seriously impressive tech                                |
| 01:03:03   | leaders.                                                                                                                  |

| 01:03:22   | Our thanks to HPE Tech Talk for their support of this show and Relay FM.                                                 |
| 01:03:28   | So David, before the outbreak, we were talking about things that are hard work and things                                 |
| 01:03:33   | that are getting easier.                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:35   | And I'm so pleased sharing falls into that category.                                                                      |
| 01:03:39   | While hard work is now getting easier and sharing has got some pretty cool changes coming                                 |
| 01:03:45   | to it, which I'm quite excited about.                                                                                     |
| 01:03:47   | I have not waded into this that much recently, grab my questions aside, but I have had a                                  |
| 01:03:57   | bit of a look and I'm quite pleased that at the very least, people are no longer going                                    |
| 01:04:02   | to have to turn on sharing for iCloud links, which was aggravating before because it wouldn't                             |
| 01:04:10   | do it unless you'd already run a shortcut.                                                                                |
| 01:04:13   | And explaining that to people was surprisingly hard at times.                                                             |
| 01:04:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:17   | There was a saying back in the US, we had this weird period where we outlawed alcohol prohibition.                        |
| 01:04:24   | And the same was during prohibition, everybody was a criminal because people would still                                  |
| 01:04:28   | drink.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:30   | I felt like up until I was 15, anybody who distributed a shortcut was still a criminal                                    |
| 01:04:37   | because the way the phone would act, because I distribute a lot of shortcuts between the                                  |
| 01:04:43   | blog and the shortcuts field guide.                                                                                       |
| 01:04:45   | If people didn't turn off a special setting, all the alarm bells went off like, oh my gosh,                               |
| 01:04:51   | you're importing a shortcut from Sparky and it's going to ruin everything.                                                |
| 01:04:55   | And so that was always a little bit of a frustration for me, but it seems like they've really taken                       |
| 01:05:02   | a lot of steps this year to make distribution easier.                                                                     |
| 01:05:04   | There's really three ways to do it now.                                                                                   |
| 01:05:08   | You want to walk through those?                                                                                           |
| 01:05:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:11   | So the first is iCloud link.                                                                                              |
| 01:05:13   | And this is now enabled by default.                                                                                       |
| 01:05:16   | Previously, this was not enabled by default.                                                                              |
| 01:05:18   | So by default, people can now share and receive shortcuts via an iCloud link.                                             |
| 01:05:24   | And this is now signed using your Apple ID as well.                                                                       |
| 01:05:28   | So I'm not 100% certain how this is going to work because you need to be signed into                                      |
| 01:05:34   | iCloud to do this, and Apple don't tend to revoke people's iCloud IDs for things.                                         |
| 01:05:39   | Developers occasionally don't get banned from the developer store or from the app store                                   |
| 01:05:44   | for things, and it's rare, but people don't usually get their iCloud accounts revoked.                                    |
| 01:05:51   | By the way, that's no a thing.                                                                                            |
| 01:05:53   | And shortcuts files are officially a thing now, David.                                                                    |
| 01:05:57   | They were there in workflow, and they were there on shortcuts, and then they disappeared                                  |
| 01:06:01   | in shortcuts, and people were very unhappy because that's how they were backing shortcuts                                 |
| 01:06:06   | up, and now they're back again.                                                                                           |
| 01:06:10   | And they are officially notarised by iCloud as well.                                                                      |
| 01:06:13   | So that means they're signed, and there's a little certificate with them.                                                 |
| 01:06:17   | And there's also a private sharing mode, which is for sharing with contacts or saving personal                            |
| 01:06:23   | backups, and these are, I believe, shortcuts files as well, and they are signed as well.                                  |
| 01:06:29   | So basically, it's just going to be official that Apple have acknowledged that, oh yeah,                                  |
| 01:06:37   | people make and share shortcuts, that's why this thing is insanely popular.                                               |
| 01:06:42   | Let's make that maybe a bit easier for people.                                                                            |
| 01:06:45   | We didn't think this was going to be a big thing, and we apparently have a lot of people                                  |
| 01:06:49   | in support, spending a lot of time supporting this, so let's fix that.                                                    |
| 01:06:54   | At least I hope that that's what went through somebody's head there.                                                      |
| 01:06:58   | And Rose and I are going to test it, and we'll report back because we're both on the beta.                                |
| 01:07:01   | But I think the idea of signing shortcuts is an excellent one, so long as it doesn't                                      |
| 01:07:07   | make it real hard for people to share, and putting personal responsibility on the shortcuts                               |
| 01:07:13   | so you can send it out in the world, I think that's a win.                                                                |
| 01:07:18   | And shortcut files is the same thing.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:19   | And I understand why they pulled it because it was really a security hole, and what if                                    |
| 01:07:24   | you got a shortcut from some bad actor and it did things, and now that they're adding                                     |
| 01:07:29   | features to it, like delete without, you know, confirm, you could do serious damage to somebody's                         |
| 01:07:36   | machine with a shortcut.                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:37   | So you want-                                                                                                              |
| 01:07:38   | Well, that's only if that person has chosen to turn that on themselves, because that is                                   |
| 01:07:43   | a setting for shortcuts rather than for, you know, for, say, a shortcut specifically.                                     |
| 01:07:52   | That's what I'm getting at.                                                                                               |
| 01:07:54   | People can, you know, by logging you into servers and doing all the things that, you                                      |
| 01:07:58   | know, the more power that gets added to shortcuts, the more danger it is for running shortcuts                            |
| 01:08:02   | from third parties.                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:03   | So they added an accountability system to it, and I'm glad they did.                                                      |
| 01:08:07   | And that third method really strikes me as kind of like a corporate deployment method,                                    |
| 01:08:11   | you know, where you've got a company where they're going to build some shortcuts that                                     |
| 01:08:15   | allow you to log into the server and do whatever, and just make it really simple to deploy                                |
| 01:08:20   | to your employees.                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:22   | But I think it seems well thought out.                                                                                    |
| 01:08:24   | I haven't, I don't have any experience with it yet, but I will, and we'll report back.                                    |
| 01:08:29   | But I mean, I like that they're putting effort into this and solving, you know, this problem                              |
| 01:08:35   | of responsible distribution of shortcuts, which is what we all want.                                                      |
| 01:08:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:39   | And the one thing that I wanted as well was for it to become a bit easier to stop sharing                                 |
| 01:08:44   | a shortcut.                                                                                                               |
| 01:08:45   | So I've had this before.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:46   | There was something, there was just a typo, I think it was, in one of the first editions                                  |
| 01:08:51   | of the shortcut, a shortcut that I created for Take Control Shortcuts.                                                    |
| 01:08:54   | So I created a new one, and it had a different URL, because I didn't just update the previous                             |
| 01:09:01   | one long, long story behind that.                                                                                         |
| 01:09:04   | But I, because I didn't have it, I couldn't get rid of the old links.                                                     |
| 01:09:09   | So people that have the old book are still emailing me saying, hey, you know, there's                                     |
| 01:09:13   | a typo in the shortcut, and it's like, I spelled the as T-E-H or something like that.                                     |
| 01:09:18   | It was out there for a few hours.                                                                                         |
| 01:09:20   | But to this day, I still get emails about it, even though the book's been out for ages,                                   |
| 01:09:24   | because people haven't downloaded an updated version.                                                                     |
| 01:09:26   | There is now the option.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:29   | So I just shared a shortcut with you via messages to test this.                                                           |
| 01:09:32   | And then I tapped on the link that I shared with you myself to open it in Shortcuts again.                                |
| 01:09:39   | And people are going, Rose, why are you doing this?                                                                       |
| 01:09:41   | If you open that link that you shared in Shortcuts again, then you get the add shortcut screen                            |
| 01:09:46   | with add and don't add.                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:48   | But if you look in the top right, there are the three buttons right there, which say copy,                                |
| 01:09:53   | there are the three dots, sorry.                                                                                          |
| 01:09:55   | And if you tap it, there's copy iCloud link and stop sharing, which kills the URL.                                        |
| 01:10:00   | So then it doesn't work anymore.                                                                                          |
| 01:10:02   | Yeah, it says this is not verified and won't let me open it.                                                              |
| 01:10:05   | Oh, well, it should be verified because there, I mean, there we go.                                                       |
| 01:10:10   | This is what happens when you run a very early beta people.                                                               |
| 01:10:13   | This is why it's for developers, not for consumers.                                                                       |
| 01:10:15   | And now it's here.                                                                                                        |
| 01:10:16   | So go figure.                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:17   | It works now.                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:18   | There we go.                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:19   | There we go.                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:20   | It just needed time to think about things, David.                                                                         |
| 01:10:22   | What is life?                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:23   | What is the meaning of life?                                                                                              |
| 01:10:24   | Computers are much deeper than we think.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:27   | Yeah, we don't give them credit for it, I mean.                                                                           |
| 01:10:29   | And if it's a bowl of petunias, oh no.                                                                                    |
| 01:10:31   | Either way, I can now stop sharing this.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:34   | So if I have an oh no moment myself, I can stop sharing a shortcut very easily.                                           |
| 01:10:38   | This was there before.                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:39   | I just wanted to make sure that it still exists and it works because I know that's something                              |
| 01:10:46   | that people have asked me frequently before.                                                                              |
| 01:10:48   | How can they stop sharing a shortcut?                                                                                     |
| 01:10:51   | And yeah, that's how you do it, people.                                                                                   |
| 01:10:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:55   | Now, these are all good things and the shortcuts team, I don't know how big it is now, but                                |
| 01:11:00   | it must be bigger because they've done so much work.                                                                      |
| 01:11:03   | They built a Mac app, they added a bunch of new actions.                                                                  |
| 01:11:06   | I mean, they've really come a long way with this.                                                                         |
| 01:11:08   | I mean, you say that, David, but I believe it was Ayaka who mentioned it in the shortcuts                                 |
| 01:11:13   | for Mac WWDC video, which everybody can get in the developer app.                                                         |
| 01:11:18   | By the way, for free, you can watch this video.                                                                           |
| 01:11:21   | She said that it's built, so the Mac OS application is built in [[SwiftUI]] for cross-platform functionality.                |
| 01:11:29   | So hopefully it's all the same code under the hood, which will make bug fixing much                                       |
| 01:11:33   | easier for them, which is great.                                                                                          |
| 01:11:36   | That's the whole point of [[SwiftUI]], really.                                                                               |
| 01:11:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:11:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:11:40   | And yeah, it's pretty great.                                                                                              |
| 01:11:41   | I am loving the fact that I can run shortcuts on my Mac, none of my shortcuts work on my                                  |
| 01:11:46   | Mac because they all use actions from third party developers.                                                             |
| 01:11:51   | And so all the ones I use day-to-day are just non, they're non-functional.                                                |
| 01:11:56   | But I mean, one thing that we've not talked about, David, which I feel probably we ought                                  |
| 01:12:01   | to, is some of the UI changes, which are present on both Mac OS and iOS, because there's a                                |
| 01:12:10   | lot that's changed here.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:12   | And I think it's for the better overall.                                                                                  |
| 01:12:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:16   | Agreed.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:17   | I mean, and it's not the massive UI overhaul that we got.                                                                 |
| 01:12:20   | What was it?                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:21   | iOS 13.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:22   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:24   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:25   | This is more subtle, but there's definitely some changes here.                                                            |
| 01:12:28   | For example, naming a shortcut.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:30   | This one caught me by surprise because I went to do the thing where you name the shortcut                                 |
| 01:12:35   | and I realised at the top of the shortcut where it says shortcut name, it would say untitled                              |
| 01:12:41   | shortcut before, you can just tap on that and you can change the name right there.                                        |
| 01:12:45   | You can tap the icon right there and change the colour and the icon.                                                       |
| 01:12:50   | And I believe we've got a few more icons now.                                                                             |
| 01:12:53   | There's certainly the categories on the Mac are quite nice.                                                               |
| 01:12:57   | I like the way that you can click to toggle between things, which is lovely.                                              |
| 01:13:02   | And they got the [[SF Symbols]] and all this going on.                                                                        |
| 01:13:06   | They don't have all of [[SF Symbols]] here.                                                                                   |
| 01:13:08   | This is just a small subset.                                                                                              |
| 01:13:09   | Totally unrelated, but have you played with the new download [[SF Symbols]] 3?                                                |
| 01:13:14   | Oh yeah.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:16   | Very nice.                                                                                                                |
| 01:13:17   | Very nice.                                                                                                                |
| 01:13:18   | I mean, I was kind of disappointed with myself that I spent Thursday night last week on my                                |
| 01:13:22   | new M1 Mac geeking out over [[SF Symbols]] because can you think of a geekier way to spend a                                  |
| 01:13:29   | Thursday night, David, because I genuinely can't.                                                                         |
| 01:13:32   | Not me either.                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:33   | On the other hand, I was geeking out on shortcuts and [[SF Symbols]] and I had a great Thursday                               |
| 01:13:38   | night for anybody who's concerned about me.                                                                               |
| 01:13:40   | I genuinely had a lot of fun.                                                                                             |
| 01:13:42   | So for listeners who are not following, Apple made its own phone called San Francisco several                             |
| 01:13:47   | years ago.                                                                                                                |
| 01:13:48   | And then two or three years ago, they started making their own glyph set called [[SF Symbols]],                               |
| 01:13:55   | San Francisco symbols.                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:57   | And they made it for app developers, so when you're building an app on the iPhone, you've                                 |
| 01:14:00   | got a really nice symbol set you can pull from.                                                                           |
| 01:14:02   | It's got things like take a picture, load an image, just typical like an envelope for                                     |
| 01:14:08   | an email application.                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:09   | And a lot of the glyphs and icons you would associate with an app, but every year they                                    |
| 01:14:15   | expand it and you can download it.                                                                                        |
| 01:14:17   | It's like an app, really, that you can pull them out of.                                                                  |
| 01:14:19   | And this year, knowing that they add even more symbols, they added the ability to put                                     |
| 01:14:24   | colours on them.                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:25   | So all of a sudden, all of my OmniFocus perspectives are getting new SF symbol based icons and                            |
| 01:14:34   | my Stream Deck is getting button updates and all this stuff.                                                              |
| 01:14:38   | If you look at some of the field guides I've made, even I've used symbols and some of the                                 |
| 01:14:41   | animations I use in there because they're just so well made.                                                              |
| 01:14:46   | And do you need to be in the paid developer to get access to that, Rose?                                                  |
| 01:14:49   | I don't know.                                                                                                             |
| 01:14:50   | I'm not 100% sure off the top of my head, I was just looking because it is on the developer                               |
| 01:14:56   | site.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:57   | There's an [[SF Symbols]] app on iPhone, which you can just download.                                                         |
| 01:15:04   | And I believe that's a third party one or maybe is a macOS one now.                                                       |
| 01:15:08   | But it looks to me like the standard [[SF Symbols]] app and the SF3 beta is actually available                                |
| 01:15:15   | for everybody.                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:17   | It is on developer.apple.com but I'm not logged in and there is no login button on this page.                             |
| 01:15:23   | It's just there's a download button right here.                                                                           |
| 01:15:25   | We'll put a link in the show notes and if you can get into it, great.                                                     |
| 01:15:30   | But if you have a need to use some icons, this is a great set.                                                            |
| 01:15:36   | I find them very useful even for presentations because I like to have very simple slides                                  |
| 01:15:40   | and sometimes you're just looking for a nice icon of an envelope and you don't have to                                    |
| 01:15:45   | use something gross off Google images if you do that this way.                                                            |
| 01:15:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:50   | It's a very easy way to just get some great icons for things.                                                             |
| 01:15:54   | Do make sure that people check the usage for things that they're using.                                                   |
| 01:15:58   | You can't use it as app icons and stuff like that.                                                                        |
| 01:16:01   | You can use it in things.                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:03   | There's an interface guide.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:04   | Follow all the rules.                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:05   | I'm not telling you to break the rules but I'm telling you that it's out there.                                           |
| 01:16:09   | Exactly.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:10   | You can download this app and use it and it works on your Mac OS and iOS devices.                                         |
| 01:16:16   | Wow.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:18   | What a year.                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:20   | I didn't expect this much automation this year but we got it.                                                             |
| 01:16:25   | The Mac thing started to feel like it was going to happen towards the end as we approached                                |
| 01:16:29   | WWDC but that could have gone a lot of ways.                                                                              |
| 01:16:33   | It could have been really ugly if they didn't do it with care and fortunately they did do                                 |
| 01:16:39   | it with care.                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:40   | It's not only did we keep our traditional tools.                                                                          |
| 01:16:42   | I think there's a lot of people who are going to be automating on their Mac that weren't                                  |
| 01:16:45   | before.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:46   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:47   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:48   | That's just it.                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:49   | I think a lot of people have said before I can't work on the iPad.                                                        |
| 01:16:53   | It doesn't have the apps I need.                                                                                          |
| 01:16:54   | It doesn't have the apps that I'm used to.                                                                                |
| 01:16:57   | Changing workflows is an expensive thing.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:59   | I mean expensive time wise.                                                                                               |
| 01:17:01   | I'm potentially money wise.                                                                                               |
| 01:17:02   | If you buy an iPad and it doesn't work out for you because it turns out you're very                                       |
| 01:17:06   | used to doing things in say logic and Ferrite won't cut it, that's acceptable but at the                                  |
| 01:17:12   | same time that could have cost you a lot of money.                                                                        |
| 01:17:15   | So they've never really looked at shortcuts before.                                                                       |
| 01:17:18   | And now shortcuts is definitely a thing that everybody should have a look at whether or                                   |
| 01:17:24   | not they feel like they need automation in their life.                                                                    |
| 01:17:27   | And I feel like it's going to be a good gateway drug for things.                                                          |
| 01:17:30   | We haven't talked about today some of the other things that you can do.                                                   |
| 01:17:34   | You can run shortcuts from the command line and from AppleScripts.                                                       |
| 01:17:39   | So as well as running command line scripts and AppleScripts inside of shortcuts, those                                   |
| 01:17:44   | things can run shortcuts which is kind of mind boggling and great but also app developers                                 |
| 01:17:51   | can build in options to run shortcuts as part of their app.                                                               |
| 01:17:56   | And they can ship shortcuts with their app with the links.                                                                |
| 01:17:59   | That's why links are signed and so on now.                                                                                |
| 01:18:01   | And I personally feel that this is a huge step forward.                                                                   |
| 01:18:05   | On the surface of it, it just appears to be, yeah, shortcuts is on the Mac.                                               |
| 01:18:09   | But the fact that there's now a command line option, so there is a command line option                                    |
| 01:18:13   | for me to list all of my existing shortcuts.                                                                              |
| 01:18:16   | So now I can pipe that into something else and open it in [[BBEdit]] if I want to.                                           |
| 01:18:21   | I could get a list of all of my shortcuts in the shortcuts app.                                                           |
| 01:18:25   | I could do that but now I can do it on the command line as well.                                                          |
| 01:18:29   | So I think for some people, this will make them sit up and pay attention and see that                                     |
| 01:18:35   | shortcuts is, you know, it might be in some ways, you know, the low level easy application                                |
| 01:18:42   | that can't necessarily do everything.                                                                                     |
| 01:18:45   | But wow, is it getting there and it can already do so much if you just use the right apps.                                |
| 01:18:51   | I can't wait until September, October when apps start shipping all of their shortcuts                                     |
| 01:18:56   | enabled Mac versions because I have a feeling this is going to be amazing.                                                |
| 01:19:01   | Yeah, me too.                                                                                                             |
| 01:19:03   | And like third party shortcuts apps from the iPhone and iPad are already starting to say                                  |
| 01:19:07   | they're going to show up on the Mac and app developers are going to show up.                                              |
| 01:19:12   | I just think automation is going to get way easier.                                                                       |
| 01:19:15   | I remember back in May 2018, Rose and I were first starting the show and we were recording                                |
| 01:19:20   | test episodes and doing things.                                                                                           |
| 01:19:23   | And we had to throw it all away.                                                                                          |
| 01:19:25   | Yeah, because that June Apple announced shortcuts for iOS and we literally threw out like three                           |
| 01:19:31   | episodes and just started over again.                                                                                     |
| 01:19:33   | And I feel like this is like another one of those moments like shortcuts arriving on                                      |
| 01:19:37   | the Mac is a much bigger deal than we can really convey in a single episode and it's                                      |
| 01:19:42   | going to be an ongoing topic on this show and it's just going to be a way for a lot                                       |
| 01:19:46   | of people that had trouble automating before, you know, a lot of people never could figure                                |
| 01:19:50   | out AppleScript.                                                                                                         |
| 01:19:51   | Well, guess what?                                                                                                         |
| 01:19:52   | You don't need to.                                                                                                        |
| 01:19:53   | You're going to be able to do a lot of automation without ever touching it.                                               |
| 01:19:55   | So this is really great stuff.                                                                                            |
| 01:19:59   | We're going to continue to cover it.                                                                                      |
| 01:20:00   | We're early in the beta.                                                                                                  |
| 01:20:01   | So Rose and I, I know my experience is like it's early in the beta, so things aren't working,                             |
| 01:20:05   | right?                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:06   | Not all the pipes are connected.                                                                                          |
| 01:20:08   | So as it gets better over the beta period, we'll be able to report back on more of the                                    |
| 01:20:12   | issues that like we have question marks on right now.                                                                     |
| 01:20:16   | Rose is going to update her shortcuts.                                                                                    |
| 01:20:20   | Take control book.                                                                                                        |
| 01:20:21   | Right?                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:22   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:20:23   | So preliminary talks with Joe at Take Control have said that I'm doing take control of shortcuts                          |
| 01:20:28   | 2.0 because quite a bit has changed since I first wrote the book and I have so many                                       |
| 01:20:34   | more ideas now for shortcuts that I can include.                                                                          |
| 01:20:38   | And there's just a whole bunch of different things that I can, I can put in there.                                        |
| 01:20:41   | So I'm, you know, I'm still working on the outline.                                                                       |
| 01:20:44   | That may change, but at the moment it's looking like it's going to be a brand new book, which                             |
| 01:20:47   | is exciting.                                                                                                              |
| 01:20:48   | And so what I'm going to do is I've been updating the shortcuts field guide, like I did one                               |
| 01:20:54   | for iOS 14, and I'll be doing and looking at it.                                                                          |
| 01:20:58   | There are new actions available on iPhone and iPad.                                                                       |
| 01:21:01   | There are some differences to the user interface, but it's not so different that I need to re-record                      |
| 01:21:06   | the whole course.                                                                                                         |
| 01:21:07   | So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a free update to the shortcuts field guide                                     |
| 01:21:11   | for iPhone and iPad with the changes that we get with iOS 15.                                                             |
| 01:21:15   | If you've already bought it, then you'll be able to get that update for free.                                             |
| 01:21:18   | If you haven't bought it, you should check it out.                                                                        |
| 01:21:20   | And that'll be released right around the time that the, around September, you know, whenever                              |
| 01:21:24   | they release it.                                                                                                          |
| 01:21:25   | And then I'm going to make an all new course for shortcuts for the Mac because that is                                    |
| 01:21:28   | like kind of a boil the ocean project for me.                                                                             |
| 01:21:31   | So I'm going to make that a separate course so you can get the Mac one or you can get                                     |
| 01:21:34   | the iPhone and iPad one and the Mac one will be a separate purchase, but that's going to                                  |
| 01:21:38   | come out too this year.                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:21:40   | This is, this is pretty great.                                                                                            |
| 01:21:42   | And there's so much that we can have fun with.                                                                            |
| 01:21:44   | I genuinely can't wait to see.                                                                                            |
| 01:21:47   | And I also did just want to say something, hopefully David, your inbox won't get too                                      |
| 01:21:51   | inundated with this.                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:53   | What I would like to say is if you are an app developer and you have shortcuts supporting                                 |
| 01:21:57   | your app and you're bringing that to the Mac and you want to get me and David on a test                                   |
| 01:22:01   | flight, which is now on the Mac, please send us an email because I would love to see this.                                |
| 01:22:08   | There's an email button.                                                                                                  |
| 01:22:10   | There's the, the really dot FM/automators.                                                                          |
| 01:22:13   | There's an email button which goes to me and David.                                                                       |
| 01:22:15   | It's an all in one.                                                                                                       |
| 01:22:16   | So, you know, you can get in touch with both of us.                                                                       |
| 01:22:19   | And I actually also iOS apps that are doing new shortcuts things.                                                         |
| 01:22:23   | Please let me know.                                                                                                       |
| 01:22:24   | I'm, I'm all in on the [[TestFlight]].                                                                                       |
| 01:22:25   | My life is a beta.                                                                                                        |
| 01:22:26   | So, you know,                                                                                                             |
| 01:22:27   | I'm going to be installing on my watch now and it's all because of Rose.                                                  |
| 01:22:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:31   | Feel free to share it in the forums as well.                                                                              |
| 01:22:33   | You know, you're welcome to, but you can get in touch with us directly as well.                                           |
| 01:22:37   | I'm sure a lot of people in our forums will be on the public beta as soon as it's available.                              |
| 01:22:41   | Little reminder, if you are not a developer, please do not install the developer beta.                                    |
| 01:22:45   | It is, dodgy is not, is, is, is an understatement.                                                                        |
| 01:22:50   | I have had to reboot my iPad like six times to get network issues fixed and stuff like                                    |
| 01:22:56   | that.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:57   | You know, apps where theoretically nothing has changed in that stack don't work anymore.                                  |
| 01:23:01   | Some people have had issues with apps crashing on launch and they've had to completely nuttily                            |
| 01:23:06   | nuke their iPad.                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:07   | Hi, David.                                                                                                                |
| 01:23:08   | I know.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:23:09   | I know you're one of those people.                                                                                        |
| 01:23:10   | Yes, I am.                                                                                                                |
| 01:23:11   | So, you know, there's all sorts of issues.                                                                                |
| 01:23:13   | They're waiting for the public beta and hopefully it'll be more stable then.                                              |
| 01:23:16   | But I know that a lot of our listeners are app developers or they've got something, even                                  |
| 01:23:20   | if you think, ah, it's, it's tiny, nobody's going to care.                                                                |
| 01:23:23   | Share it.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:23:24   | People want to know.                                                                                                      |
| 01:23:25   | And this is the only way that people are going to, well, it's not the only way I hope                                     |
| 01:23:28   | that people are going to find out, but this is one of the great ways that you can share                                   |
| 01:23:30   | things.                                                                                                                   |
| 01:23:31   | And we're kicking the tires and we just kind of want to see how all this stuff works together.                            |
| 01:23:34   | And if you're putting hard work on it, we'd love to hear from you.                                                        |
| 01:23:37   | And even maybe tell us a little bit about your story about, you know, what you're looking                                 |
| 01:23:42   | for with your automation.                                                                                                 |
| 01:23:43   | How hard was it?                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:44   | This is all stuff that the users want to know, ultimately, and we're going to have some                                   |
| 01:23:48   | guests on the show.                                                                                                       |
| 01:23:49   | I mean, this is the thing, man, and, um, and I have very good feelings about it.                                          |
| 01:23:54   | I think that Automation on the Mac is going to really jump with this release.                                             |
| 01:23:59   | I think a lot of people, like I said earlier, are going to get into it that wouldn't have                                 |
| 01:24:03   | otherwise.                                                                                                                |
| 01:24:04   | Yes.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:24:05   | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                                         |
| 01:24:06   | And especially one thing we did mention, which I should mention just before we end                                        |
| 01:24:09   | the show, for anybody who has previously had to release a new version of an app, and they've                              |
| 01:24:14   | gone from, say, 1.0 to 2.0, and they've had to do shortcut sections, and they're the same                                 |
| 01:24:19   | shortcut sections, but for users, they have to go in and replace all their shortcut sections.                             |
| 01:24:24   | There's an upgrade path now provided by Apple.                                                                            |
| 01:24:26   | So if you're listening and you're going, huh, I know of an app that's currently having issues                             |
| 01:24:31   | with that, then maybe, you know, give the developers a little while and ping them and                                     |
| 01:24:35   | drop them an email and just say, hey, if you didn't know this, by the way, this is now                                    |
| 01:24:39   | a thing, because that would be great if all of the apps can just upgrade things so that                                   |
| 01:24:44   | stuff doesn't break.                                                                                                      |
| 01:24:45   | I know previously, Greg Pierce, Mr. Agile Tortes, had to, this was when [[Drafts]] actions                                    |
| 01:24:50   | were just built into shortcuts.                                                                                           |
| 01:24:53   | He had to ping the guys on the shortcuts team and say, there's a new version of Drafts.                                   |
| 01:25:00   | Can you change all the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]s that you're using, please?                                                             |
| 01:25:03   | And then, of course, we got the actions, and that's all been sorted out since then, which                                 |
| 01:25:07   | is great.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:25:09   | I'm very pleased about that, but yeah, it's one of those things where there's a lot of                                    |
| 01:25:14   | potential pain points which are being dealt with here, and I can't wait to see what this                                  |
| 01:25:20   | summer of betas brings us.                                                                                                |
| 01:25:22   | Before we finish today, I want to tell you about another show here on [[Relay FM]].                                          |

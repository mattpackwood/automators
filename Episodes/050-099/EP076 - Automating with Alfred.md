| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators. I'm David Sparks, and I'm joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard,                 |
| 00:06      | and this is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your bidding for you.              |
| 00:12      | How are you, fellow Automator Rosemary Orchard?                                                          |
| 00:14      | Oh, I'm excited. There's something purple in the post. Actually, it's probably still                     |
| 00:20      | in a factory somewhere, but, you know, it's on its way, theoretically.                                   |
| 00:23      | Oh, that's nice.                                                                                         |
| 00:24      | Purple Mac.                                                                                              |
| 00:25      | And in the meantime, I have a purple floaty thing on my computer when I press Command                    |
| 00:28      | Space.                                                                                                   |
| 00:29      | Command Space gets you the purple floaty thing you're talking about, [[Alfred]], which                       |
| 00:33      | is what we're going to talk about today.                                                                 |
| 00:35      | Before we get into [[Alfred]], I just want to share with the listeners a funny story about                   |
| 00:39      | Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                        |
| 00:40      | So before the show, she's got a week off. I said, well, just take a week off and, like,                  |
| 00:46      | don't do a bunch of work. And she says, oh, yeah, I'm totally taking my time off. And                    |
| 00:49      | then she sends me a picture of new locks she's installing in her house. That's how Rose                  |
| 00:54      | takes her week off, King.                                                                                |
| 00:56      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 00:57      | So, David, I should be clear for our listeners. You told me to take off a week off of worky              |
| 01:02      | work. Okay. So I'm still going to be recording podcasts and stuff. I'm actually slightly                 |
| 01:06      | amping that up because I'm about to start a new job and I want to be able to give myself                 |
| 01:09      | a little bit of a buffer when I start. But that means I'm not going out and looking for                  |
| 01:13      | extra, like, articles to write and videos to record, things like that. But I have a                      |
| 01:18      | whole list of home automation projects that I want to get done. So of course I installed                 |
| 01:22      | a new smart lock. Why wouldn't I?                                                                        |
| 01:23      | Why are you at it? Are you going to replace those old copper pipes in the kitchen? I mean,               |
| 01:27      | you might as well do that, too.                                                                          |
| 01:29      | No. No. No. So, our kitchen is a bathroom strictly off limits, according to UK building                  |
| 01:33      | regulations. So I'm living with whatever the previous owners had there because it, yeah,                 |
| 01:40      | it's that or pay somebody qualified to deal with it. And I don't think it's really worth                 |
| 01:43      | it right now.                                                                                            |
| 01:44      | Well, we've had a lot of email from listeners asking us to do a show about how to automate               |
| 01:48      | using [[Alfred]]. And then it came up in the relay [[Slack]] recently and we're like, okay, everybody,           |
| 01:53      | we're going to do [[Alfred]]. So [[Alfred]] is a Mac based launcher application. We actually                     |
| 01:59      | talked about launcher apps on episode 497, I think of Mac power users. I'll put a link                   |
| 02:05      | in the show notes. And we talked about, you know, [[LaunchBar]] and [[Alfred]] and several and                   |
| 02:11      | I came out of that episode after all the research for that episode, I believe we're in [[Alfred]].           |
| 02:14      | So I've been using [[Alfred]] now for a couple of years. You know, I used to be for but I've                 |
| 02:19      | been using it full time. I think Rose, you've been using [[Alfred]] full time basically since                |
| 02:22      | [[Alfred]] came out, right? Weren't you an early adopter for [[Alfred]]?                                         |
| 02:27      | I think I was a fairly early adopter. I'm not sure I was the earliest adopter. I'm                       |
| 02:30      | sure I've been using it at least since [[Alfred]] to looking in my 1Password licenses section.            |
| 02:36      | I've got licenses for the power pack for [[Alfred]] for two, three and four. And four is the most            |
| 02:42      | recent version. And that's actually something we should maybe cover because [[Alfred]] itself                |
| 02:47      | is free. And it's a great application for free. But if you want to do some of the nerdiest               |
| 02:53      | stuff that we're talking about today, you're going to need the power pack for that, which                |
| 02:56      | is a like a one time in-app purchase license. Actually, you can get it from the website                  |
| 03:01      | because [[Alfred]] is a Mac application. And yeah, it's great. It allows you to do way                       |
| 03:09      | more stuff with [[Alfred]] than, you know, you might have otherwise thought, oh, I'm not                     |
| 03:14      | really sure if, you know, I could do this or that, you know, it lets you do all of the                   |
| 03:20      | extras, the really, really cool stuff. So we'll dive into exactly what the power pack                    |
| 03:24      | gives us in a couple of minutes. But [[Alfred]] itself, it's like spotlight on steroids.                     |
| 03:30      | That's how I would explain it for people who aren't familiar with this sort of application,              |
| 03:34      | David. Yeah, sure. I mean, it just does so much more                                                     |
| 03:36      | than spotlight. And the nice thing is because it's a Mac app and a web based thing, like                 |
| 03:42      | they do upgrade pricing. I think I bought version two, but I've only had to pay upgrade                  |
| 03:47      | price for three and four. And it's just that, you know, it's a solid spotlight replacement,              |
| 03:54      | but it does weigh more. And if you're interested in automation, this app has so many hooks for           |
| 03:59      | you to go deeper down that road. So we thought it'd be fun today to kind of just kind of                 |
| 04:04      | go through some of the things we do with it and how we automate our day. And, you know,                  |
| 04:12      | we talk often on the show about very detailed automations, you know, writing keyboard, maestro           |
| 04:15      | scripts or shell scripts or things like that to automate your life. But I have this distinct             |
| 04:22      | memory a few years ago where I spoke at a local Mac user group. And the I was going                      |
| 04:29      | to talk about photos or something. I don't remember what the subject was, but my screen                  |
| 04:34      | was on, my screen was up on the projector behind me. And as I was prepping to run it,                    |
| 04:42      | I had [[Alfred]] running. And I was doing all this crazy stuff with [[Alfred]] that, you know,                   |
| 04:46      | get the right apps, get the right documents, do all these things. And when it was time                   |
| 04:52      | for me to talk, someone said, before you talk about photos, can you explain what you just                |
| 04:56      | did? You know, because they were all watching me running [[Alfred]] and my computer was dancing              |
| 05:01      | around and they had no idea what was going on. So the presentation turned into like half                 |
| 05:07      | [[Alfred]] and half photos because, you know, a lot of folks don't realise how much more                     |
| 05:12      | efficient you can be with one of these launcher apps installed on your computer.                         |
| 05:16      | Yeah. Yeah. So [[Alfred]] is a great way to pretty much do everything that you need to do with               |
| 05:21      | your computer via your keyboard. Like you don't need to use your mouse. And also it can involve          |
| 05:28      | less keyword actions than using something like spotlight. So if I open spotlight and                     |
| 05:32      | I search for preview, and I have a couple of things that I've used recently with the                     |
| 05:36      | name preview in them, they might show up before the application. So in order to access that,             |
| 05:40      | I would need to use the down arrows and then return to get to say the third item. In [[Alfred]],             |
| 05:46      | you can just press command three to go to open the third item in your list. And actually,                |
| 05:51      | if you look inside of [[Alfred]], when you're, when you're searching for something, then                     |
| 05:55      | you'll see over on the right hand side, command two, command three, command four, all the way            |
| 05:59      | through to command nine. And depending on what theme you're using, that that might be                    |
| 06:04      | slightly grayed out. The theme that I'm using shows that in a nice bright white to remind                |
| 06:09      | me that it's there because otherwise I forget about it and I'm arrowing up and down. And                 |
| 06:13      | I realised halfway through a list of nine items when I'm aiming for the ninth item.                      |
| 06:18      | First of all, you can always press the up arrow to go, you know, around the loop. If                     |
| 06:22      | that makes sense, you can wrap around with your arrows. But I could have just pressed                    |
| 06:26      | command nine and been right there and had that document open 30 seconds ago. Okay, not 30                |
| 06:31      | seconds. I'm not that slow with my arrow keys. But you know, the point is, is it's a more                |
| 06:36      | efficient way of doing things.                                                                           |
| 06:37      | Yeah. And even on that basic issue of spotlight of open an app and run an app, I feel like               |
| 06:43      | [[Alfred]] beats it there too. A good example is like, as I'm sitting here, if I do a spotlight              |
| 06:49      | search for pages, the first result is the pages application, which is great. But underneath              |
| 06:55      | that, it wants to do a search for pages preview wants to look for the pages website, or it               |
| 07:01      | wants to show me folders with the name pages. Whereas if I do that search for pages in [[Alfred]],           |
| 07:08      | it gives me the option, the first option to open the pages application, but the remaining                |
| 07:12      | 10 options underneath it are all of the recent documents I've opened with pages. I mean,                 |
| 07:18      | how often do you want to open pay, you know, go to pages and utility like this to find                   |
| 07:25      | a pages folder versus open a recent document. I mean, I always want to get into a recent                 |
| 07:30      | document and it puts them in order of, you know, last opened. So I use this so often,                    |
| 07:37      | I don't even think about it anymore. And most apps support this recent document plug in                  |
| 07:43      | Microsoft Word sadly does not. They have a weird thing they do with file management.                     |
| 07:47      | So it doesn't plug in. But I mean, that's just an example of even the most basic thing                   |
| 07:52      | you do with spotlight is better in [[Alfred]]. Yeah, it really is. And just being able to                    |
| 07:59      | access your recent documents means that it's a lot easier to do things. So the other thing               |
| 08:04      | you can do is for me, if I search for say preview, it doesn't necessarily show my recent preview         |
| 08:09      | documents. But if you yet then do option and the right arrow, then it will show you your                 |
| 08:14      | recent preview documents. And then you can, there's this thing, which we'll dive into                    |
| 08:20      | a little bit later where you can actually stack a bunch of documents and then do actions                 |
| 08:24      | on them through [[Alfred]]. So you don't need to be hunting around in Finder for things.                     |
| 08:29      | You can just, you know, stack them up above [[Alfred]]. And then, you know, make magic happen.               |
| 08:34      | It's kind of crazy that it just works like this. But it good crazy, not that crazy.                      |
| 08:39      | Yeah, if you wanted to go like over the deep end, [[Alfred]] could completely replace the finder.            |
| 08:46      | I mean, you could do all file management. I'm not recommending that you do that, but                     |
| 08:52      | you actually could pull it off. Like, I think there's a terminal command to hide the finder.             |
| 08:56      | Maybe that should be like a challenge just for a week. You know, stop, don't do that.                    |
| 09:01      | That's crazy. But you know, it is kind of cool that that this thing is so powerful and in                |
| 09:07      | file management. Yeah, it really is. But, you know, I also feel like it does a better job with           |
| 09:13      | the logic of search. Like, I don't know if this is still true or not, but like it used to be,            |
| 09:18      | oh, now they fix, no, yeah, they fixed it. It used to be in spotlight if you type one for                |
| 09:22      | 1Password or it immediately went into calculator mode and you couldn't get to one                     |
| 09:27      | password. So you'd have to type password to get to 1Password. And it was like just a little           |
| 09:31      | tick you had to remember, whereas [[Alfred]] has never had that problem. It always just goes,                |
| 09:36      | you know, it just figures out what app you're using. I think one of the things that looks at             |
| 09:39      | is, you know, how often do you open this app? And it promotes the options based on usage,                |
| 09:46      | which, you know, is the way it should be. Yeah. And I think that's the thing, you know,                  |
| 09:51      | all of this is based on usage. So I think we should probably go back to the start with                   |
| 09:56      | [[Alfred]], David, and talk about search because a lot of what people do with [[Alfred]] is based around         |
| 10:03      | searching. So one of the primary things I use it for is launching a specific application.                |
| 10:08      | If I'm looking for the terminal, I'm not going to open launch pad or something like that. I'm            |
| 10:13      | going to, and I try not to keep applications in my dock. This is a personal preference,                  |
| 10:18      | but I don't have applications in my dock that aren't running. There are a few applications               |
| 10:23      | which always live in my dock. So I've got [[Airmail]], [[Fantastical]], [[Drafts]], [[OmniFocus]] and [[Obsidian]],           |
| 10:29      | and [[Safari]]. That's it. Those finder obviously has to live in my dock as well. But those are the          |
| 10:36      | only applications that live in my dock. All of the other applications are just active applications.      |
| 10:40      | So I'm not going to be looking across my dock for terminal. And I don't want to open launch pad and      |
| 10:45      | then search for terminal because I then have to move my mouse. And depending on how big your             |
| 10:50      | screen is, that may be more work than you're willing to do. Mine's not that big, but it's                |
| 10:56      | just annoying. So to start with, if I want to open an application, then I just search for the name       |
| 11:02      | of that application. And I type literally David T and it suggests terminal because it's one of my        |
| 11:07      | most frequently used applications. And underneath that, I've got better telegram and better touch        |
| 11:12      | tool showing up as other options. So I can use it to open applications very, very quickly without        |
| 11:20      | taking my hands off the keyboard. Yeah. I know there's a running battle on my computer right now         |
| 11:25      | between [[Obsidian]] and OmniFocus for the letter O and [[Alfred]]. It's like, they can't make up its            |
| 11:31      | mind. Which one does he like? But you're right. It is funny for your most frequently used apps.          |
| 11:38      | It's just the single letter. Whereas when you do that same search in spotlight, it just isn't as smart.  |
| 11:46      | Actually, spotlight is indeed suggesting terminal to me. And then underneath that,                       |
| 11:49      | it's suggesting home dash Canon TR4550, which is my printer. I never open my printer, David.             |
| 11:57      | I have no idea what spotlight is doing here. [[Spotlight]], go home, you drunk. But yeah,                    |
| 12:03      | unsurprisingly, [[Alfred]] is not suggesting my printer. I only want my printer to open if I'm               |
| 12:08      | printing a document. I'm never going to search for it this way.                                          |
| 12:11      | Okay. And spotlight for me with O is giving me [[Obsidian]]. And then in second place, Knights of            |
| 12:17      | the Old Republic, which is a game I downloaded and have not played on this computer at all.              |
| 12:21      | And then under that OmniFocus, which is an app that is open like 24x7. So go for it.                 |
| 12:26      | Yeah. Well, mine is showing Fnatic, which is for keyboard that I have. OmniFocus and [[Obsidian]] in         |
| 12:33      | that order versus the [[Alfred]], which is showing [[Obsidian]] and then OmniFocus. I guess I was using          |
| 12:40      | [[Obsidian]] more recently than OmniFocus for this because I saved some notes in there for this              |
| 12:43      | show, David. Yeah. And so just launching apps is great. And it's not just there to find apps that        |
| 12:51      | also can find files. Maybe we should, do you want to talk about files now?                               |
| 12:56      | Yeah, yeah. So let's talk a bit about files. I gotta be careful here. I don't want to scare              |
| 13:00      | everybody away. I think let's talk about files at a surface level right now, David. We can get to        |
| 13:04      | the complex automations that you can do with those later. So with [[Alfred]], you know, just the same        |
| 13:09      | way as you search for an application, you can search for a file. So I recently downloaded a whole        |
| 13:15      | bunch of pay slips. And so if I type in pay, then I can see all of those pay slips because their,        |
| 13:21      | you know, year, month company pay slip is the name. So if I search for pay, I can seal of those.         |
| 13:29      | And that's great because I can use my command and my numbers to go through them. And if I type,          |
| 13:34      | you know, 2021 pay, then I'll see 2021 pay slips. But when I found the right document,                   |
| 13:40      | I can actually use the right arrow on that to see a bunch of options. So if I just press return or       |
| 13:46      | select one of the options from a file, then, you know, it'll just straight up open it. That's my         |
| 13:51      | default action. But if I use the right arrow on that file, then I get a whole bunch more options,        |
| 13:58      | which are just crazy in the best possible way. So of course it's open. And then they're specifically     |
| 14:03      | open with. So these are all PDFs. So if I wanted to open them with a PDF pen, instead of preview,        |
| 14:11      | then I could do that. I can reveal it in Finder. I can email it to a specific person,                    |
| 14:16      | or I can just start an email. I can get info, copy to move to delete, find similar, browse the whole     |
| 14:23      | folder in [[Alfred]]. And this is one of the actions we're going to have to come back to, because this       |
| 14:28      | for me is incredibly useful. And there's also open the terminal here, open the the pass to the           |
| 14:33      | clipboard, and copy the file to the clipboard. And you can also add custom actions. So I have            |
| 14:38      | copy markdown link here, because that can be useful for me. But I have some others,                      |
| 14:44      | which we can get to later as well. It's just really nuts. I mean, you can do, like I said,               |
| 14:50      | you can replace the Finder with it. But I think that right arrow trick is when a lot of people           |
| 14:54      | don't realise. So you once you find the file, the right arrow is a is an automator tip, honestly,        |
| 15:01      | to to act on the file, because the usual reaction when you see something like this would be like,        |
| 15:06      | okay, well, I can open that file. So I'll click return to open it, or I might be able to expose          |
| 15:11      | it in the Finder. And then I can open the Finder and I can do things with it there. But why not          |
| 15:16      | do the action right from the quick action bar in [[Alfred]]? And that's a clever trick.                      |
| 15:23      | Yep. And it saves you a lot of time, because do you really want to open the file and then use            |
| 15:28      | the share option to send it by email? You probably don't. You probably just want to go,                  |
| 15:33      | where's this file, right? I want to email it without having to, you know, hunt around for                |
| 15:37      | things. And there's other ways of doing this as well, like [[Yoink]] has an [[Alfred]] workflow,                 |
| 15:42      | which you can install from its preferences. So you could [[Yoink]] the file and stick it in [[Yoink]],           |
| 15:47      | which can be useful if you want to do multiple files. But we'll come back to the more complex            |
| 15:52      | file stuff later, where you can act on multiple files. Because of course, you know, there's              |
| 15:59      | way more crazy things that you can do. But I think before we dive into that, David, we should also       |
| 16:03      | have a look at some of the other options that we've got with [[Alfred]] that are just sort of pretty         |
| 16:09      | much baked in. And one of the ones I want to talk about is the calculator, because I love this.          |
| 16:16      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by The Intro Zone. I love finding new podcasts to           |
| 16:21      | listen to. And it's great when you find something that's not only great to listen to, but actually       |
| 16:26      | useful as well. If you're looking for a new show to listen to, The Intro Zone is a bi-weekly podcast     |

| 16:54      | topic of the week, guest perspectives, FAQs of the week, and upcoming events. And the topics for         |
| 17:00      | the shows are really interesting. They cover migration to the cloud, AI and machine learning,            |
| 17:07      | and even things like cloud admin. I recently listened to their episode on Viva topics,                   |
| 17:14      | and I have to say I do kind of love the idea of having an AI getting in with my files and                |
| 17:19      | suggesting things to me based on everything else available. I won't spoiler it, but it's a great         |

| 17:46      | So one of the little features of [[Alfred]] David that I really want to talk about is the calculator.        |
| 17:52      | And this sounds so silly. It's not going to put Peacock or Solver or any of the other great              |
| 17:56      | calculator apps for macOS out of business today or tomorrow. But for me, the calculator is incredibly    |
| 18:03      | useful for a number of reasons. Number one, of course, it's under my fingers, so I can just open         |
| 18:08      | it with command space. And then if I want to type, I don't know, 23 times 471. I type 23,                |
| 18:15      | asterisk 471. And I can see the result right there. And this is great because if I hit return,           |
| 18:23      | the action option, then that's going to save that to my clipboard. So I can just paste that              |
| 18:28      | somewhere. And I use that all the time when I'm just trying to get some basic maths done                 |
| 18:33      | that I just need to paste into something. For example, calculating the number of seconds in a            |
| 18:37      | day is something that you need to do relatively often in programming for whatever reason. And I          |
| 18:43      | have yet to memorise the number of seconds in a day. And I don't like writing it all out. So I           |
| 18:48      | usually calculate it and then paste it into whatever application I'm currently writing in,               |
| 18:54      | which is great. But there is, of course, more that you can do with this. Because if you hit equals,      |
| 19:00      | then it puts the number that you've just calculated into [[Alfred]] for you to do more                       |
| 19:05      | calculations with, which is something it took me a really long time to figure out. But I love that       |
| 19:10      | equals button now. Yeah, well, it gives you a bunch more math functions, sine, cosine, tangent,          |
| 19:16      | logs, you know, all the, a lot of the things that you may want for a more advanced calculation           |
| 19:23      | available, but just hit the equals sign first. And then you say, okay, we're going into advanced         |
| 19:26      | mode. I use it as well. And one thing I would add is, you know, when you learned math,                   |
| 19:33      | or do you guys call it math, you make it plural? Because it's mathematics. Yeah, well, we call           |
| 19:39      | math over here because we're, you know, we're, you know, the colonists, you know, just keep dropping     |
| 19:46      | things. But yeah, but we got, you know, if you want to do advanced math, you can add parentheses.        |
| 19:52      | So it's like, like you want to do calculations within calculations, you can add those. And               |
| 19:57      | like I often have to do interest calculations for contracts and things like that. And                    |
| 20:01      | a quick tip I have created a TextExpander snippet, because that's one of the things you can do with     |
| 20:07      | [[Alfred]]. It will expand TextExpander snippets right inside. So like I have a standard interest           |
| 20:12      | calculation where I just do fill ins and TextExpander with the basic numbers. And then it,              |
| 20:18      | it creates the formula in an [[Alfred]] statement. And then I hit return. And then it gives me my            |
| 20:24      | answer. So it's a very quick way to do relatively basic math, but, you know, constructing that           |
| 20:32      | every time with parentheses and, you know, making sure you get everything right as a                     |
| 20:36      | pain in the neck. So I just made it a snippet. Yeah. And that's one of the things that I like,           |
| 20:41      | you know, you can integrate things like that with this. Because of course, as well as the                |
| 20:46      | calculator, [[Alfred]] has some other options. I think now might be a good moment, David,                    |
| 20:50      | to talk about the power pack. Yeah, sure. So the power pack in [[Alfred]] is, it's the option to             |
| 20:58      | expand [[Alfred]] for one of a better word. That's not really the right way to say it. But it's,             |
| 21:06      | for me, at least in the UK, it's 29 pounds. They're not showing me, David, on the website,               |
| 21:11      | the prices and dollars. So you're going to have to double check that. But the power pack with            |
| 21:16      | [[Alfred]] allows you to do things like create custom searches and enable one of my other                    |
| 21:21      | favourite features, which we'll come to in a minute, which is the clipboard history.                      |
| 21:25      | I love the clipboard history. It saved my bacon about 80,000 times over the last month.                  |
| 21:30      | But it also has the option to do text expansion itself. And you can either use snippets or               |
| 21:37      | auto expansion for that. And then it's got music integration. And some of the file actions,              |
| 21:45      | I think, actually do need the power pack as well. I have to say,                                         |
| 21:48      | I'm one of the mega power pack supporters. So I've had a lot of this for a very long time.               |
| 21:55      | But it allows you to do customise hotkeys and keywords and context integration. And also                 |
| 22:03      | something I use a lot, which I'm guessing some of our listeners probably won't.                          |
| 22:06      | Shell and terminal commands, you can just do them straight from [[Alfred]],                                  |
| 22:10      | like move this to there. I do that. For some reason, I prefer to use the terminal to move files to       |
| 22:19      | certain locations. Like, for example, when I installed TJ Luoma, it's a Fantastical stream                |
| 22:25      | deck system. I'm calling it a system because it's a whole bunch of [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros               |
| 22:30      | plus Stream Deck integration. I did, I moved those files I needed to move with [[Alfred]],                   |
| 22:36      | rather than anything else. It also has integration with custom themes and 1Password. And sync         |
| 22:43      | is one of the power pack features. And I personally do love the sync. Even if you only have one mac,     |
| 22:49      | it means that you're [[Alfred]] settings. It's not really a backup because it's a sync,                      |
| 22:54      | but it means that you can put your [[Alfred]] settings on another computer, which I really like.             |
| 22:58      | Yeah, just honestly, if you've made it this long in the podcast, just get the power pack,                |
| 23:03      | because almost everything we're going to talk about needs it. And they list the price in                 |
| 23:07      | the United States in pounds too, as well as $29 for a single user, $49 for MEGA. I probably              |
| 23:13      | should have bought MEGA supporter if I think about how many times I've upgraded this thing.              |
| 23:16      | But I think I upgraded last time, actually, David, just because I thought, you know what,                |
| 23:21      | I want to check on some extra money. And why not? Because [[Alfred]] really is one of those                  |
| 23:28      | things where if I try to use a computer with just spotlight, I'm trying to do things like,               |
| 23:33      | I'll do a calculation and press return, and then wonder why it's not on my clipboard.                    |
| 23:39      | And then I'll want to get back to the previous thing that was on my clipboard.                           |
| 23:42      | And then I won't be able to do it because I don't have [[Alfred]] installed. A lot of people say,            |
| 23:47      | you know, my computer feels broken before I set up, you know, TextExpander, or Fantastical,              |
| 23:54      | or Bartender, one of those apps. For me, that app is definitely [[Alfred]]. I mean,                          |
| 24:00      | there's several apps, let's be honest. But [[Alfred]] is one of those that I feel like I really need it      |
| 24:05      | to be actively, productively using my computer. Yeah, you know, I hear that once in a while              |
| 24:13      | from pundits where they say, hey, I don't want things like [[Alfred]] or keyboard master on my               |
| 24:18      | computer, because I want to be able to sit at any Mac and be able to run it the same,                    |
| 24:22      | and I have to worry about that. And that argument is completely lost on me. I'm like,                    |
| 24:28      | how often do you sit at some random computer and do work? I mean, the only computers I sit               |
| 24:33      | are the ones that have my files on them. They're my computers. So I customise the heck out of them.      |
| 24:38      | I want to be able to make [[Alfred]], you know, stand up and do cartwheels for me so I can                   |
| 24:45      | don't have to do them. And having that every day for the occasional inconvenience, like,                 |
| 24:50      | I guess I do sit at my wife's computer to do maintenance or something. But, you know, what               |
| 24:53      | do I do? I run a maintenance application, I do a backup, and then I close the lid. I mean,               |
| 24:58      | I don't care. So yeah, I don't buy that. I feel like, you know, stuff like this is something,            |
| 25:04      | if you want to really automate and make your computer work harder for you instead of making              |
| 25:08      | you do the work, you should totally get the power pack and just dive in, man.                            |
| 25:14      | Yeah, yeah. Let's talk a little bit about the clipboard history.                                         |
| 25:19      | Yeah. So clipboard history is one of those features. You need the power pack for it.                     |
| 25:24      | And then I believe it's, oh, gosh, I'm now just looking at my [[Alfred]] preferences and I can't             |
| 25:29      | find it, David. Where did it get hidden? It's under features. There we go. It's features and             |
| 25:34      | clipboard history. And you can enable this and you can enable clipboard history for plain text           |
| 25:39      | images and even file lists. And you give this a different shortcut. So you don't. So say you open        |
| 25:47      | [[Alfred]] with command space, which by the way, I highly recommend if people are looking at                 |
| 25:52      | playing with [[Alfred]], change spotlight to option space and put [[Alfred]] under command space because         |
| 25:57      | [[Alfred]] can do everything spotlight does and more. So, you know, that's a good place to start.            |
| 26:03      | But that trigger doesn't open your clipboard history, the default [[Alfred]] tree. You need to               |
| 26:08      | specify a different one. And I don't remember, David, if I've changed mine, you'll have to tell me if    |
| 26:12      | yours is different. Mine is a command option C for clipboard. Yeah. Mine is control command C.           |
| 26:22      | So I don't know. Maybe I changed it. I honestly, you know, I've been using things along. I don't         |
| 26:26      | remember. Yeah. Yeah. You need to enable this first though. If you don't enable it, then you             |
| 26:32      | won't see clipboard history in general. So, and you can specify how long clipboard history is safe       |
| 26:39      | for. I've just gone with 24 hours on my side. I there's also options for seven days a month              |
| 26:44      | and three months. I copy and paste so much. I think if I had three months of clipboard history           |
| 26:49      | on my Mac, I'd have a full SSD. So I'm not going to do that. But you can customise that. And I           |
| 26:56      | really appreciate that as well, because I don't need, you know, three months worth of clipboard          |
| 26:59      | history hanging around. But 24 hours is usually enough for me. Yeah, we're going to do a show,           |
| 27:05      | I think, on clipboard managers at some point, because there's so many options out there. But             |
| 27:10      | this is an excellent one. And the thing I like is that it keeps plain text. It also keeps images.        |
| 27:16      | And it does give you metadata around them so you know where they came from.                              |
| 27:21      | They have a feature called clipboard merging, where you can tap it and then double tap C to              |
| 27:30      | get to add a bunch. So like the idea for this is let's say you're building a document and you've         |
| 27:35      | got a source document you're working from. You can basically append to clipboard by going through        |
| 27:42      | and using this feature. So you can say, well, I want this paragraph, and then this paragraph and         |
| 27:46      | that paragraph. And you only have to paste it once and it assembles them all for you. Yeah.              |
| 27:50      | This feature makes me nuts. I don't like it at all, because I always seem to trigger it when I'm         |
| 27:56      | not when I don't don't mean to. And then when I go to paste, I've got a bunch of texts I didn't need.    |
| 28:01      | This never sunk in for me, but I know some people love that.                                             |
| 28:06      | Yeah, no. So I also have this disabled. I think I've just never really found a need for it. A            |
| 28:11      | lot of the time I would much prefer to go, I'm looking for this, right now I'm looking for this,         |
| 28:15      | now I'm looking for this, and I'm done. I'm good. Finished. Thank you so long and thanks for all         |
| 28:20      | the fish. So it's a great option for people who need that. However, I would suggest perhaps if           |
| 28:28      | you're doing that, then clipboard history might not be the place for that snippets, expansions,          |
| 28:34      | text expansion, that sort of thing, which we'll come to in a minute, can better serve you there          |
| 28:41      | rather than copy pasting. So yeah. But it's useful all the time because you can think,                   |
| 28:49      | right, okay, I need these five things. I'm just going to copy them all. And then you're going            |
| 28:53      | through filling out a form and you just use the clipboard history repeatedly to get those five           |
| 28:58      | things. And you're not going to need them for longer than the length of time it takes you to             |
| 29:01      | fill out this form. But you want to have them easily accessible for that period of time.                 |
| 29:08      | Yeah. And I personally don't use the clipboard history. I actually run it as a backup because            |
| 29:14      | if something goes wrong, but my primary clipboard history is [[Keyboard Maestro]]. And whenever we get       |
| 29:19      | around to that show, I'll explain why. But [[Alfred]] is perfectly fine. And if you're not a keyboard        |
| 29:25      | maestro person or you don't like their clipboard and you've got [[Alfred]], one thing [[Alfred]] is is           |
| 29:29      | way better than the built-in clipboard because this isn't got a history and all that's you,              |
| 29:33      | you know, keep it for many days. Yeah. So a little bit more information about the clipboard              |
| 29:39      | history. Of course, you can search. So earlier today, I copied a link from packal.org. We'll              |
| 29:45      | come back to that link later. And so if I type pack, then it shows me a couple of different              |
| 29:50      | things. I've got an emoji pack here, which, you know, that's, that's one of those things. And            |
| 29:55      | then I've got two links which have Packal in them. David, one of them is from your blog, surprised?       |
| 30:02      | And then the other one is the, the OmniFocus workflow. So one of the things I would check                |
| 30:07      | for people who are using or want to look at the clipboard history is under the clipboard history,        |
| 30:13      | there's three tabs. There's history, there's merging, and there's advanced. If you want to use           |
| 30:17      | merging, go ahead, toggle that on, have a play with it. But under advanced, make sure auto paste         |
| 30:23      | on return is checked. Now, this is on by default. But this means that when I, I, I search in my          |
| 30:30      | clipboard history, and I search for Packal, and then I hit return, this pastes it into my current         |
| 30:37      | document, exactly where my mouse is done. Like I don't need to think about anything else. I don't        |
| 30:42      | need to command V or anything. It just happens. There's also an option down here at the bottom,          |
| 30:50      | or two options, ignore clipboard data marked as concealed and ignore clipboard data marked as            |
| 30:55      | also generated. That means that it's not going to copy any passwords or anything that you,               |
| 31:01      | you have if you try and copy them. And, and stuff that's also generated. So things like                  |
| 31:07      | [[Safari\|Safari's]] form filler, it's not going to copy that stuff. There are also specific options to              |
| 31:12      | ignore apps. And by default, it ignores keychain, security agent, 1Password and your wallet.          |
| 31:19      | All of which good apps to ignore, you don't necessarily want that data in your clipboard                 |
| 31:23      | history floating around. Because I've found a couple of recalcitrant apps won't let me fill              |
| 31:29      | them in with 1Password, David. So I've been copying a pasting passwords to get them in there.         |
| 31:33      | And I don't want that in my clipboard history. But of course, if you do have stuff in your               |
| 31:38      | clipboard history, and you think, Oh God, you know, I'm starting a completely new thing now,             |
| 31:41      | I just want a clean slate, command space, trigger [[Alfred]], quit all applications,                         |
| 31:47      | and then open your clipboard history, type clear, and boom, you can just clear all of                    |
| 31:53      | your clipboard history, or you can clear the last five minutes or the last 15 minutes.                   |
| 31:58      | And there's also a button in the [[Alfred]] preferences where you can click,                                 |
| 32:02      | you know, clear all history now. And yeah, it's, it's great. I love it. It really makes                  |
| 32:10      | my life much, much easier. You know, we kind of ran off half cocked on this episode. One of the          |
| 32:15      | things I meant to say at the beginning is when you use [[Alfred]], Rose and I have been talking              |
| 32:19      | about system preferences for [[Alfred]]. So to get to that, and this is, I'm sure it's obvious to            |
| 32:25      | veteran users, but sometimes you forget. When you command space or whatever your trigger is for          |
| 32:32      | [[Alfred]], it doesn't do the usual thing where it puts the [[Alfred]] app in the menu bar, because              |
| 32:37      | this is a utility, you can put the [[Alfred]] menu bar icon up, though, and you can access preferences       |
| 32:43      | there. But I find the easiest way is you hit command space to activate [[Alfred]] and just hit               |
| 32:48      | command comma. And we should have said that at the top of the show, because we're, as we're talking      |
| 32:53      | about all these settings and things we're doing at [[Alfred]], it's that command space slash command         |
| 32:57      | comma that makes it happen. So that's the trick. Command space, command comma. You can also type         |
| 33:05      | pref or PR or, you know, something like that or preferences in full. And it will show you to open,       |
| 33:11      | it will show you the option to open [[Alfred]] preferences as well as system preferences and                 |
| 33:15      | perhaps any files or applications you have with preferences in the name. But if you type it,             |
| 33:20      | then you can access it from that as well. Yeah. So David, one of the things I love about [[Alfred]]          |
| 33:27      | is the snippets and text expansion. Now, I know you're firmly in the text expansion camp and I'm         |
| 33:33      | one of those people where I periodically go off and explore because I've got quite a bit in text         |
| 33:37      | expander, sure. But I, you know, I always like seeing what else is out there and what else I             |
| 33:43      | might be able to do. And one of the things that definitely sells me on [[Alfred]] to an extent at            |
| 33:49      | any rate is that it has an emoji pack with 1,349 snippets built in, which is pretty darn cool.           |
| 33:56      | All right. Well, explain it because I, you're right. I just use [[TextExpander]]. I feel like that's        |
| 34:00      | kind of a solved problem. I like the ability that it can run [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]]. And I've just got            |
| 34:05      | all kinds of weird automation stuff running through TextExpander. But what are the advantages for       |
| 34:10      | [[Alfred]]? How does this emoji thing work? Well, let's start with snippets and [[Alfred]]. So once              |
| 34:16      | again, you're going to need to open [[Alfred]]'s preferences, command space, command comma.                  |
| 34:21      | And then under the feature section, there's snippets and clippings. So to start with,                    |
| 34:28      | you're probably going to want to have a poke around there. And I know those of you who used              |
| 34:32      | [[Alfred]] before might find things like [[Alfred]] to snippets hanging around, which yes, I have. And           |
| 34:38      | you can rename any of these by double clicking on them. So I'm actually going to fix that right          |
| 34:42      | now. It now just says [[Alfred]] snippets. Perfect. So to start with, you can have a snippet keyword.        |
| 34:50      | And I didn't mention this, but there's also a clipboard keyword where if you open                        |
| 34:54      | [[Alfred]] and then type that keyword, then you'll see clipboard history or with the snippet keyword         |
| 35:00      | default is S, by the way, then you'll see these snippets available to you. Now,                          |
| 35:07      | the way [[Alfred]] differs from some other applications is it doesn't necessarily                            |
| 35:12      | automatically expand things for you. So if you type one of these worthy snippets,                        |
| 35:19      | then it won't expand it unless you open the snippet manager. And my option for this is                   |
| 35:26      | command option control S. Oh, sorry. It's no, it's command shift, command option shift S.                |
| 35:34      | That was it. Sorry. I'm trying to read the symbols and not doing the actions with my fingers.            |
| 35:39      | And that's a very silly thing to do because I usually type with my fingers rather than my brain.         |
| 35:46      | So if you do that, then it'll pop up the snippets. And there's actually some                             |
| 35:51      | favourite snippet collections, which I've linked in the show notes for people.                            |
| 35:53      | So you can download those. Maybe I'm misspeaking the emoji pack wasn't pre-installed and I               |
| 36:00      | installed it ages ago. But there's snippets for Mac symbols. There's some funny quotes.                  |
| 36:06      | There's [[ASCII]] art, you know, like the table flip series of brackets and characters. There's also         |
| 36:14      | currency symbols and some dynamic content and date math ones, which aren't useful just to see            |
| 36:21      | how it works. But the emoji pack that I mentioned as well is listed here. And so you can actually        |
| 36:28      | see if you click on get collections in this window, then there's some examples. And basically,           |
| 36:32      | what it means is when you type this thing, then this thing appears instead. So for people who've         |
| 36:37      | never used it, then, you know, that's how that works. It'll replace whatever you've written.             |
| 36:42      | So with the emoji pack, if you press colon, type the word six, and then press colon again,               |
| 36:48      | then it will replace that with a six in a little box, which, you know, great, if that's what you         |
| 36:54      | want. And why this might better for some people, if you don't already own TextExpander or something     |
| 37:01      | similar and you want to try text expansion, and you've paid for the offer power pack, well,              |
| 37:05      | it's free, you know, so why not give it a go? And it's not limited to just I can replace                 |
| 37:13      | David MacSparky with David Sparks every time or MacSparky with David Sparks and brackets Max           |
| 37:18      | Sparky, whatever it is you want it to do. You know, you can also do, as I mentioned before,              |
| 37:25      | they've got these dynamic content examples. Have a look at those if you want to see how crazy you        |
| 37:30      | can go. But it's useful for just things like, you know, fixing the way that you always incorrectly       |
| 37:35      | spell your own name. David, I can't spell my own name. I've written my own name. I have no idea          |
| 37:40      | how many millions of times in my life. I still, when I'm typing, managed to swap the S and the E         |
| 37:47      | or the E and the M on a regular basis in my first name.                                                  |
| 37:50      | It's probably just you're going too fast. You know how to spell your name.                               |
| 37:52      | I think so. Yeah. But I fix it with text expansion. Like, that's one of the problems this solves.        |
| 37:58      | And also for just things that you write on a regular basis. And so, for example, until, you              |
| 38:05      | know, recently I've been working for a German speaking company, they have two different ways of          |
| 38:10      | saying dear. So dear Mr. So-and-so is written one way, but dear Mrs. So-and-so is written a different    |
| 38:16      | way. So, you know, I, and remembering that, you would think that after five years of living in a         |
| 38:22      | German speaking country, plus two years before that of living in another German speaking country         |
| 38:26      | and a degree in German, my brain would have this down. For whatever reason, I always ended up googling   |
| 38:32      | it. And one day I was realising, why do I keep googling this? I could just write sehr her or sehr        |
| 38:38      | frau and have it automatically expand and put the Geherte in the middle with the correct ending.         |
| 38:46      | Done. Like, no thinking about it. Oh, that's brilliant. Why didn't I think of this a year ago?           |
| 38:52      | Or, you know, five years ago, it would have been much easier. But I have things like that in there       |
| 38:57      | because it makes it a lot easier for me. And it, you know, it, one of those things you might want        |
| 39:03      | 18 different mail signatures, but you keep switching between different email applications                |
| 39:07      | because you can't decide what's best. So saving them all in your email application doesn't work for      |
| 39:11      | you. So save them as text snippets instead, and then expand them wherever you need them.                 |
| 39:16      | Yeah, you know, the emoji problem is an interesting one. So this is one more potential solution for      |
| 39:22      | it. I mean, the real problem with emoji, in my opinion, is that, you know, Apple didn't finish           |
| 39:27      | the job, you know, control command space opens up a keyboard with the emoji where you can pick           |
| 39:34      | from it, but it doesn't have an easy search. And it's just like, it's like, they had a lunch             |
| 39:39      | meeting that day or something, and they forgot to come back to it. I don't know what happened there.     |
| 39:43      | Yeah. Well, I would actually like to take a minor detour there because inside of [[Alfred]],                 |
| 39:48      | you can have collections of snippets. And this is basically folders of snippets.                         |
| 39:53      | And so you can toggle each one on and off. So I have the emoji pack. It's actually disabled.             |
| 39:59      | And the reason for that is, and I've put a link to this in the show notes for people,                    |
| 40:03      | I'm using an application called Rocket, which is free. And it works the same way typing in [[Slack]]         |
| 40:09      | and [[Discord]] stuff does. So if you're in the Relay FM [[Discord]], and you're used to typing colon,          |
| 40:13      | I don't know, thumb, and then it comes up with thumbs up and thumbs down, and you select the             |
| 40:18      | right one. Rocket does exactly that. And you can disable it on a per app basis,                          |
| 40:23      | which is what I use for emojis. So it means that when I'm writing in messages or                         |
| 40:28      | [[Discord]], I have the same experience. Obviously [[Discord]], I'm using [[Discord\|Discord's]]                              |
| 40:32      | native experience, but messages doesn't have that one. I type colon wave. It just doesn't                |
| 40:37      | offer me that option. But with Rocket, it does. But, you know, if you don't want yet another             |
| 40:41      | application, then you can use [[Alfred]]. Yeah. And Rocket is free. You're like reading my mind              |
| 40:48      | rows, because I was just about to mention Rocket, which is a free app that can put this anywhere.        |
| 40:53      | So there's a lot of different ways to skin that cat. But, you know, the point is,                        |
| 40:58      | you know, text expanded or cost money. And there's only so much money we all have to                     |
| 41:02      | spend on apps. And if you're all in with [[Alfred]], I think it's a perfectly sufficient way to do           |
| 41:08      | text expansion, you know? Yes. And go for it, you know? I mean, use what works for you.                  |
| 41:15      | Yeah. And in particular, when you're creating a snippet. So there's two kinds of snippets you            |
| 41:23      | can create in [[Alfred]]. There's plain text and rich text. So if you're typing markdown, you know,          |
| 41:27      | it's plain text. If you want rich text with bold and underlines already formatted, then you're           |
| 41:32      | going to use rich text. And if you select rich text, then you get a little AA button over on the         |
| 41:37      | right hand side of the text box. It's a large text box, by the way, David. This is one of the            |
| 41:43      | things I love about this versus the native macOS and iOS built in autocorrect button, which you          |
| 41:49      | can kind of hack to be text expansion. This is a nice big text box. And so this AA button gives          |
| 41:56      | you options for, you know, showing your fonts, bold, italic underlying colours, copying a style           |
| 42:02      | from something and pasting a style. But regardless of that, whichever you're doing, at the bottom,       |
| 42:07      | there's a button with two curly brackets in. So a left curly bracket and a right curly bracket.          |
| 42:12      | And if you click this, then this is snippets. So you've got options for date or date and time,           |
| 42:19      | date and time math. So one month ago or an hour from now or a day from now or a month and so on.         |
| 42:26      | There's also clipboard history. So you can put your current clipboard content in,                        |
| 42:30      | but you want it uppercased or capital case or trimmed. So there's no extra spaces at the beginning       |
| 42:35      | in the end. There's also the option to put placeholders for other snippets in there. It gets             |
| 42:41      | kind of crazy. You can also have random. So you can have random fruit. If you would like a random        |
| 42:48      | fruit in your snippet, you can do that. You can also have random Jesus. There's also random numbers      |
| 42:53      | between one and 10, a random positive number, random negative numbers, UUIDs, we've mentioned            |
| 42:58      | those before. There's also the ability to specify your cursor permission. So that's where you're         |
| 43:04      | going to type when this is done. And then you can also just ignore dynamic placeholders,                 |
| 43:10      | which means that those things won't be expanded for you.                                                 |
| 43:14      | So I mean, this is, it's not as fully fledged as something like TextExpander,                           |
| 43:20      | where you can use JavaScript to write custom things, which will do magical math to make stuff            |
| 43:25      | happen. But it's pretty good. Like if you want to get started with text expansion,                       |
| 43:31      | you could do much worse than starting with [[Alfred]].                                                       |
| 43:33      | Yeah, especially if you've already got a license. I mean, go for it.                                     |
| 43:36      | Yeah. Yeah, exactly.                                                                                     |
| 44:07      | Your internet service provider like Comcast or Verizon knows every single website you visit.             |
| 44:13      | And if they want to, they can sell this information to ad companies and tech giants.                     |
| 44:18      | ExpressVPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so that                |

| 45:41      | One of my favourite features with [[Alfred]], and I don't know how many times a day I use this                |
| 45:46      | feature, is web search. And, you know, we've all done web searches before, you know,                     |
| 45:50      | the way we learned to do it was you would open your browser, and then you'd go to                        |
| 45:55      | Ask Jeeves, and you'd type in a search, you know, and then eventually, you know, we got                  |
| 46:00      | better search engines and better browsers where you could just type a search engine                      |
| 46:05      | into the URL bar of your browser, and it would do a search for you. But [[Alfred]] brings it to,             |
| 46:13      | like, a whole new level. Because if you go into those, that magic [[Alfred]] settings we're talking          |
| 46:18      | about, command space, then command comma. And then you go on that sidebar over to features and           |
| 46:25      | web search. It's the fourth one down. You have a bunch of key terms already built in that do a           |
| 46:33      | search for you. Like, for instance, if you want to search Google, you would activate [[Alfred]],             |
| 46:37      | command comma, and then I just type G-O, actually I get it with G, and then the first                    |
| 46:43      | offer is search Google for, and then you hit return. And then you type your search, you know,            |
| 46:48      | automators podcast, and then it goes off and does a search of automators podcast on Google for you.      |
| 46:54      | But there's so much more because, you know, everybody does Google searches, but why not                  |
| 46:59      | target your search? Like, you want to search in Google Maps or Apple Maps, or you want to translate.     |
| 47:05      | Like, if I just type TRA, then it opens up the ability to translate. One that I do all the time          |
| 47:13      | is Drive. It's Google Drive. It searches my Google Drive for automators outline, you know.               |
| 47:19      | IMDB, eBay, another one that I use sadly too much is Amazon. Like, you type Amazon, and it searches      |
| 47:28      | the Amazon store for whatever it is you want. So rather than going to Amazon and trying to do the        |
| 47:33      | search in their app, you just type AMA, in my case, return, then whatever product you're looking at,     |
| 47:38      | and it opens up Amazon. Now, in order to make that Amazon one work, one of the things you need to do     |
| 47:42      | is when you set up [[Alfred]] the first time under the General tab is you need to indicate your country,     |
| 47:47      | so it searches the right store. But, you know, you want to do that. But I just, I mean, all of these,    |
| 47:54      | another one I use all the time is YouTube. Like, I want to go into YouTube and learn about Greek         |
| 47:59      | philosophy, you know. I just type YOU, and then it prompts me YouTube search, and I hit Enter,           |
| 48:05      | and I just type Greek philosophy, and then up they come, you know. And so whatever it is you             |
| 48:10      | want to search, they've got it. They have a Facebook one, but I mean, who would use that, right?         |
| 48:16      | IMDB, Bing. So if you want to go to the other side and search with Microsoft, you can do that.           |
| 48:22      | Wolfram Alpha, you know, we don't talk about that much, but that's a really powerful engine.             |
| 48:26      | DuckDuckGo, which is a great tool for privacy. [[Alfred]] Help, Rotten Tomatoes, you know,                   |
| 48:32      | they've got a bunch of them here. And as you learn to use them, it's the only way to search the web.     |
| 48:39      | And let's just talk about that now. But in a minute, I'm going to talk about                             |
| 48:44      | how you can customise those as well. I mean, do you use the built-in ones?                               |
| 48:48      | Yeah, yeah. So I use the built-in ones, and I've got a couple of custom ones as well.                    |
| 48:53      | And I definitely second David's tip. Under general, make sure your country is set correctly.             |
| 48:57      | After I moved from Austria, I had to go and change that because it was searching                         |
| 49:01      | Amazon Germany for me. Because I actually, so a little tip, if you don't have a local Amazon,            |
| 49:07      | so for example, you live in Portugal or the Netherlands or Austria, you won't have a local               |
| 49:12      | Amazon. There is no Amazon Netherlands, Amazon Portugal, Amazon Austria. You use, you know,              |
| 49:17      | your adjacent country. So for Austrian Netherlands, it's probably Germany. And for Portugal, it's Spain, |
| 49:23      | there's plenty of other countries in the world that have to use another country's Amazon as well.        |
| 49:27      | And so you can, you can customise that. So I changed mine back to the UK, and voila,                     |
| 49:33      | I'm now searching UK Amazon and UK eBay and UK Google versus, you know, amazon.com, which                |
| 49:41      | great, but I get murdered on shipping charges and Prime does not deliver next day if I do that.          |
| 49:46      | So I'm not going to be doing things like that. My Yale lock came from Amazon UK,                         |
| 49:50      | thanks to one of their actually very good deals. But yeah, it's well worth doing it.                     |
| 49:56      | Because the other thing is, say I search for something, I don't know, sleep monitor.                     |
| 50:01      | One of the things that [[Alfred]] will do for you, if you just search for something and it can't find it     |
| 50:05      | on your computer, or under the options that it's found on your computer, kind of like a                  |
| 50:11      | spotlight does, spotlight or the bottom has options to search the web and search in finder.              |
| 50:17      | Thanks, spotlight. But if you can't find it in finder, we'll find or find it in finder.                  |
| 50:22      | If you type something and [[Alfred]] can't find it on your computer, it has built-in options to search       |
| 50:27      | Google, Amazon, and Wikipedia. So if I type sleep monitor in, which is something I don't have much       |
| 50:33      | of written about on my Mac, then it gives me the options to search Google, search Amazon,                |
| 50:38      | and search Wikipedia for those three options for that phrase or query, rather. And that's great          |
| 50:47      | because it means if you type something and you thought, oh, man, I thought I bookmarked that             |
| 50:51      | because guess what, [[Alfred]] can search your bookmarks too. We might have to talk about that in a          |
| 50:55      | minute, David. Then you can go off and search on the web for it instead.                                 |
| 51:02      | Yeah, powerful stuff. And then, like I was teasing earlier, you can also create custom searches.         |
| 51:08      | And the custom searches, there's a couple things about that. They're not that difficult to make.         |
| 51:13      | Like I made one for MacSparky and all you do is you type in the web search query from your              |
| 51:19      | website, any website that has a search bar and it has a web search query, just go to                     |
| 51:23      | the search bar and you can paste it out of the URL. But you do have to paste in in the,                  |
| 51:29      | what do you call this squiggly bracket? Is that what you call this squiggly bracket?                     |
| 51:33      | Curly braces. Curly braces. There we go. Spoken like a true program. With the word query in it,          |
| 51:38      | and that passes whatever you have in [[Alfred]] to the search. But you can put them in, like if              |
| 51:43      | there's a website you go to frequently, like I was thinking, and it just occurred to me right            |
| 51:47      | before we recorded today, so I need to make quantities for the automators forms. But I                   |
| 51:53      | need to make quantities for the automators forms, because why not just be able to search the forms?      |
| 51:57      | And it would be very easy to put something like that together.                                           |
| 52:00      | Yeah. A little tip I will give people, if they're trying to figure out what is the search                |
| 52:06      | query for a website. A lot of websites are well coded. So that means that you could type in the          |
| 52:11      | website URL, and then there's a lookup button on the right. And then it will use two different           |
| 52:16      | options. It can use open search and search action to try and find something. The other                   |
| 52:22      | website doesn't have a built-in search. There are these websites out there. Or the built-in              |
| 52:26      | search is really sucky, because they've got tons of data, and it would take literal masses               |
| 52:33      | of computing power to do that. Then you can also do a search with Google or duck duck go,                |
| 52:41      | your site preference, take your pick, and append it with site colon, and then the website URL.           |
| 52:47      | So for example, if the automators form didn't have a search, that's not true. It does have a             |
| 52:51      | very good search, actually. Then you could put site colon, talk.automators.fm. Done. And then it         |
| 53:01      | would search specifically the automators forms with your search engine of choice. I love duck            |
| 53:07      | duck go for that, David. I don't know where you are. But there's also at the bottom of this a            |
| 53:12      | validation where you can type, where it will have text. Of course, the default text is [[Alfred]] app.       |
| 53:19      | And then if you press test, it will try to execute the search replacing the curly braces                 |
| 53:27      | query with whatever it is. So one I'm using right now, screencast online. And I've just                  |
| 53:32      | searched for [[Alfred]] in screencast online. And it turns out that in January 2020,                         |
| 53:37      | they did an [[Alfred]] 4 video. So if anybody wants to watch a video on that and is a screencast             |
| 53:42      | online member, then I'll put a link to that in the show notes for you.                                   |
| 53:45      | Yeah. But those web searches, I think, are a killer feature. And one again, I think a lot                |
| 53:51      | of people aren't aware of and don't use. And so use the built-in ones. But if you're                     |
| 53:58      | currently or constantly going to a single website for searches, just build it into [[Alfred]]. You can       |
| 54:04      | make it yourself. Yeah. Yeah. So don't necessarily, you won't have to open [[Safari]], Firefox, Chrome,      |
| 54:11      | Edge, whatever your browsers of choice, press command L, and then type it in and then search             |
| 54:18      | for it. Instead, you just come on space to [[Alfred]], type your search query, done. And I find that to      |
| 54:25      | be insanely useful. And you want to talk about contacts? Well, before we talk about contacts,            |
| 54:31      | David, I think I teased people just now. I think we should talk about bookmarks a minute.                |
| 54:35      | All right. Let's do that. Because web bookmarks are something, so if you're a Firefox user,              |
| 54:41      | I am afraid you're out of luck here. [[Alfred]] only integrates with bookmarks in [[Safari]] and Chrome.         |
| 54:48      | But basically what this means is you can turn on searching your bookmarks. So obviously,                 |
| 54:54      | in the bookmarks of [[Safari]], that's my browser of choice, I actually use [[Safari Technology Preview]],       |
| 55:00      | but it integrates via [[Safari]], so it's fine. If I search for automators, then as well as                  |
| 55:07      | all of the other things on my computer that come back with automators, I also see results that say,      |
| 55:13      | automators form. And when I open it, it opens [[Safari]] and goes to talk.automators.fm. Because             |
| 55:20      | I've turned on, and this is the fifth option down in features, sources, [[Safari]] bookmarks,                |
| 55:27      | under web bookmarks. And I have my bookmarks show in the default results because I don't                 |
| 55:33      | bookmark many things. I'm very selective about my bookmarks. I do not use my bookmarks as a              |
| 55:38      | relater service. If you do use your bookmarks as a relater service, then you may not want to use         |
| 55:44      | this feature, just because you're going to have tons of stuff. Unless, of course, you want all           |
| 55:48      | of that stuff to show up, in which case it's perfect. And yeah, they do recommend don't                  |
| 55:55      | enable browsers that you don't need here. So I do also have Chrome installed for a variety of reasons,   |
| 56:00      | debugging among them. And I don't have bookmarks enabled for Chrome because, obviously, the more         |
| 56:06      | stuff you put into [[Alfred]], the more it's going to have to process things. And the more it has to         |
| 56:09      | process, the slower it's going to be overall. I've personally never, ever had a performance              |
| 56:15      | issue with [[Alfred]], ever. But I don't enable things. I don't need that either.                            |
| 56:21      | And neither have I. And I actually question why they don't have bookmarks turned on by default.          |
| 56:26      | It surprises me. If you forget to turn it on and you expect to see them, they're just not there.         |
| 56:32      | Well, David, when's the last time you worked in first level support? Because                             |
| 56:35      | having seen some of the horrors that people do with their bookmarks, I've met plenty of people           |
| 56:39      | with well over 10,000 bookmarks. I can easily see why the [[Alfred]] developers there decided,               |
| 56:45      | let's not turn that on by default. Yeah, I'm like you. I'm pretty conservative with bookmarks.           |
| 56:50      | I mean, I use them, but I don't. Yeah, I don't treat it as a readout later service. So yeah,             |
| 56:56      | I see there you go. Yeah. But yeah, it's there. And just make sure if you haven't got it turned on,      |
| 57:01      | like we've said, go into the preferences fifth item down, it's one toggle and turn it on.                |
| 57:09      | So David, do you want to talk about contacts? Yeah, I think I've held you off for long enough.           |
| 57:13      | Contacts on [[Alfred]]. Well, I think contacts are just really handy in [[Alfred]] because they give you         |
| 57:19      | more options than spotlight does, you know, in spotlight, you can get a contact. And if you              |
| 57:25      | select the contact, it has things you can do, but they're very limited options. Whereas with             |
| 57:30      | [[Alfred]], you have kind of full control. If I hit in [[Alfred]] command space, and then Rosemary Orchard,      |
| 57:36      | and then return, I've got a list of everything here, I've got your birthday, I've got phone numbers      |
| 57:41      | and email addresses, and all of them, I can go through them. And then once I select one,                 |
| 57:46      | like I can hit command, see to copy it, or I can hit return to open and create a new email to you,       |
| 57:52      | or, you know, anything I want to do with that data. And I just feel like that, you know, [[Alfred]]          |
| 57:58      | does a much better job of making that stuff present and giving you more power. Like I constantly         |
| 58:04      | am sitting emails introducing people like as a lawyer, I'll say, oh, you need to talk to this            |
| 58:09      | insurance person or whatever. And I want to put details in the email so that people can talk to          |
| 58:14      | each other. It's so much easier to do that with [[Alfred]] than it is with [[Spotlight]].                        |
| 58:20      | Yeah. And that is one of the things I love, you know, you just, the other thing is, is it's not          |
| 58:26      | just, so I've searched for David Sparks right now, and it showed me David Sparks macsparky.com,           |
| 58:30      | and you're an emoji, because that's the photo I have saved for you, because that's what contacts         |
| 58:35      | did. But here, I've got email address, I've got your domain name, I've got phone number, I've got        |
| 58:41      | your physical address. And depending on which of these I have selected, it gives me different            |
| 58:45      | options. So I can press return on an email address to email you, I could command C to copy it,           |
| 58:50      | and I can also do command L for large types. So if I want to show your email address in massive          |
| 58:56      | letters, I think this is more useful for stuff like Wi-Fi passwords, and that's a feature one            |
| 59:00      | password actually has built in. But the return for email address disappears if I mouse over,             |
| 59:05      | if I use the arrow to go down to your domain name, it then says open this URL. And if I mouse down       |
| 59:11      | again to your address, it opens it in maps and will give me directions to get all the way to             |
| 59:15      | California. Wow, David, it got lost in the ocean, you're gonna have to send a boat to come get me.       |
| 59:21      | And so does it involve the submarine? I don't know, but you're gonna have to send a search party out.    |
| 59:27      | Make sure your favourite doodle is ready for me. But yeah, I like this because it gives you these         |
| 59:34      | options. And of course, it's smart about these things as well. So for stuff like Twitter handles         |
| 59:40      | and things like that, because I've got all of that added, it doesn't give me an option to open           |
| 59:44      | that on Twitter. It just gives me the option to copy it. But I don't use the Twitter app,                |
| 59:49      | I use Tweetbot anyway, and macOS doesn't have a setting for your default Twitter application.            |
| 59:55      | So that's probably for the best. But I like it. And I like the fact that I can press escape to           |
| 01:00:01   | go back at any time. If I have multiple David Sparks's in my Contacts book, and I press enter            |
| 01:00:08   | on the wrong one, and I go, oh man, it's the wrong one. I press escape, I go back, I mouse down,         |
| 01:00:13   | or I use the arrow keys to go up and down, and then I go back to it. And if you use the action           |
| 01:00:21   | button, so that's your command one through nine, and also the return key, then it does the same          |
| 01:00:28   | thing there, which for me is perfect. I love it. Yeah, I used to use that large type when I              |
| 01:00:35   | worked for the law firm, because I had a standing desk where my laptop was, and                          |
| 01:00:39   | the phone was on the other side of the room, and sometimes I'd want to call somebody,                    |
| 01:00:42   | I just put a large type. I would add if you are interested in using [[Alfred]] for contact management        |
| 01:00:48   | to go into the settings. Once again, there's an advanced tab, like if you wanted to show                 |
| 01:00:53   | last name before first, or put job titles in, or even select which maps to use to get maps,              |
| 01:01:00   | you know, hopefully one that will give rows a submarine. But there's a lot of customisation              |
| 01:01:05   | you can do with the Contacts, so you can make it work just the way you want.                             |
| 01:01:08   | Yeah, and it's great. I love it. So, you know, please give it an option, give it a go and give           |
| 01:01:17   | it a try, because, you know, it's amazing how little I use the actual Contacts application.              |
| 01:01:24   | If I want to add a contact, then I'm going to use something like card hop, because I just                |
| 01:01:28   | paste a whole bunch of information from the email signature, and it magically goes through               |
| 01:01:31   | parses out, and I'm done. But if I want to actually just access like an email address or                 |
| 01:01:38   | something, or honestly, if I want to email somebody, I won't start with opening my email                 |
| 01:01:42   | application and pressing Command N. I start with [[Alfred]] now, because if I open my email, last            |
| 01:01:49   | day check, David, I have 34 unread email messages, because I haven't been on top of my email today,      |
| 01:01:53   | and the last thing I want, if I need to just send somebody a quick email, is to be, you know,            |
| 01:01:58   | smacked with the avalanche of unread email. It happens easily, it, you know, and it's totally            |
| 01:02:04   | normal. But if I want to send somebody an email, I don't want to get, you know, sidetracked with         |
| 01:02:09   | that. Yeah, I mean, that's the whole idea, right? Once you open the email normally, the inbox hits       |
| 01:02:16   | you, and who knows if you're going to actually remember this in the email you open it up for.            |
| 01:02:21   | Anytime you can take that distraction out of your, out of your face, you're doing better.                |
| 01:02:26   | Yeah. One more small one, I want to, I want to talk about [[Alfred]] work, because we're going to            |
| 01:02:30   | wait till later, because while we're on these little ones, I think another one I would mention           |
| 01:02:35   | is system preferences and system commands. So with [[Alfred]], like you can put your computer to             |
| 01:02:45   | sleep, and all you have to do is type command space and then sleep, and then it puts your computer       |
| 01:02:51   | to sleep, or restart. And there's some of these things that for whatever reason, Apple just doesn't      |
| 01:02:57   | put those in spotlight. Maybe they don't want somebody accidentally shutting down, but [[Alfred]]            |
| 01:03:01   | trusts you. And so all the system commands that you normally do, like I can never remember               |
| 01:03:07   | the weird keyboard shortcuts for restart, sleep, turn monitor off. I know it involves the escape         |
| 01:03:13   | key and something else, but you know, I just can never remember. So I just use [[Alfred]] for all that       |
| 01:03:18   | stuff. Yeah. And I love this. There is one, and I do have to be a little careful when I am looking       |
| 01:03:26   | for a quick time, because if you type quit instead of quick, then one of the options that comes up       |
| 01:03:33   | is quit all applications. And this is something you can of course do with [[Keyboard Maestro]].              |
| 01:03:38   | And I actually have a couple of different ones where I, you know, I quit, you know, my open              |
| 01:03:43   | applications as part of another macro. But sometimes at the end of my day, one of the things I'm         |
| 01:03:48   | trying to integrate into my shutdown routine is just quitting all of my open applications.               |
| 01:03:52   | Because again, it's like email, you open your email and you get slammed with the 34 and read             |
| 01:03:57   | emails. And all you wanted to do was send David Sparks an email about the next episode of                |
| 01:04:01   | altimeters and the guest who's going to be on because she's fabulous and amazing,                        |
| 01:04:05   | or something like that. And you know, it ends up being a lot more than I want when I get                 |
| 01:04:12   | their first thing in the morning. And I just want to quickly do this one. Oh, no, no, okay,              |
| 01:04:17   | I've got 80,000 things open from yesterday. And I get sucked into this Amazon tab that I had open        |
| 01:04:22   | looking at battery packs, because I never have enough battery packs. I have a max safe one now,          |
| 01:04:26   | David. I don't know how that happened. Oh, Rose, just wait till you have kids. I mean,                   |
| 01:04:30   | honestly, I think I just need to tell Amazon to send me a new battery every two months because           |
| 01:04:37   | they just disappear. Yeah, I keep my battery in my little workbench in my studio and everybody           |
| 01:04:43   | knows where it is. And every time I go, it's gone. I swear my parents are the same. Like every time      |
| 01:04:51   | I go over there, I end up giving them a battery pack. My mom really wanted my max safe battery           |
| 01:04:55   | pack the other day, but fortunately, she's got an iPhone 11 pro, not a 12. Because she's got my          |
| 01:05:00   | old iPhone. And so I was very happy to inform her, this doesn't magnetise to the back of your phone.     |
| 01:05:06   | So I got to keep it. Which [[MagSafe]], I haven't bought one of those yet. And now I need one again.         |
| 01:05:10   | And which one did you get? So Anker, I have one. It's not actually [[MagSafe]]. It's a magnetic.            |
| 01:05:17   | It's their power core magnetic, I think 10,000. I don't think the 20,000 is out yet,                     |
| 01:05:21   | or maybe it's the 5,000, the 10,000 is coming. Either way, it does stick on the back of your             |
| 01:05:25   | iPhone, though, in on the [[MagSafe]] area. So that's pretty cool. I'll put a link to it in the show         |
| 01:05:31   | notes. And as you said that, I just opened up for that type AMA, Anker, Power, what do you              |
| 01:05:38   | say, our Anker? I think PowerWave? Yeah. And it showed up. It was the first result.                     |
| 01:05:44   | You can get a 10,000 milliamp hour one delivered tomorrow for $49.99. Boy, they make it easy,            |
| 01:05:51   | don't they? I see the little circle on the back. So you can just lay your phone on top of it if          |
| 01:05:55   | you want. Nice. Does it charge your watch too? No, because it's only, so Apple watches are a bit         |
| 01:06:03   | finicky to charge. So it doesn't charge that as well, unfortunately. But so, oh wait, it depends         |
| 01:06:11   | on which one you're looking at. I will make sure that the link to the correct one is in the show         |
| 01:06:14   | notes for everybody. It doesn't show up immediately when I search for it on Amazon. And I, of course,    |
| 01:06:21   | bought it from Amazon UK versus Amazon.com. $39.99. It is the 5,000 milliamp hour one,                   |
| 01:06:27   | and the link is officially in the show notes. Thank you to [[Alfred]] for helping me create that link.       |
| 01:06:35   | Well, I do think it's cool that you access this stuff so quickly. In fact, almost some days,             |
| 01:06:40   | I feel like the Amazon one should be turned off. I want to have a little side rabbit hole there,         |
| 01:06:44   | gang. But on system settings, one thing you can do is you can actually, in the settings for [[Alfred]],      |
| 01:06:50   | once again, command space, command comma, if you go under feature, system is towards the bottom.         |
| 01:06:54   | You can individually require confirmation for a lot of the commands, like restart or shutdown            |
| 01:07:01   | can require confirmation. So you wouldn't accidentally trigger it. But it is crazy how                   |
| 01:07:08   | deep down the stack this goes. If you type VOLUP, the volume goes up. I mean, I'm not sure that I'd      |
| 01:07:14   | want to do that through [[Alfred]]. But if you wanted to, you could. So I have volume up and volume down     |
| 01:07:20   | enabled purely for when I'm connected via remote desktop software. And I use Jump Desktop for that       |
| 01:07:27   | for people who are curious as part of the setup suite for the Mac application, where I can then          |
| 01:07:33   | access other computers with it. I pretty much use it on my iPad Pro. It's great for that. So that's      |
| 01:07:39   | good. But I use it for things like that because every so often. And I know this is really weird.         |
| 01:07:45   | I play music from my Mac to my HomePods. And if I'm remoted into my Mac for something else,             |
| 01:07:52   | because I love my Mac mini, it's great. And it'll seem be a purple iMac, which will be even better.      |
| 01:08:01   | Then, you know, so I'm often remoted in doing stuff like messing around with Affinity Publisher,        |
| 01:08:07   | which doesn't yet exist on iPad. And if I'm playing music from my iPad, I don't have those               |
| 01:08:13   | media keys on my iPad. So I can adjust, you know, the volume and the mute as well. And also,             |
| 01:08:20   | I highly recommend having the mute toggle available. Because if you use the Alpha                        |
| 01:08:25   | remote application, and you accidentally leave your computer running, then you can hit mute,             |
| 01:08:29   | and then make sure your Mac goes to sleep from your bed without getting up. But we'll come back          |
| 01:08:35   | to the Alpha remote application after this. Get organised and unleash your creativity with               |

| 01:09:51   | placeholders or inserted by your own AppleScript code. And of course, there's so much more from          |
| 01:09:57   | the iOS companion app to email archiving, scanning, or even an embedded web server for sharing your      |
| 01:10:03   | data securely with your team. I've been using DEVONthink for a while now and I am sold.                  |
| 01:10:10   | There really is nothing like it on the Mac in order to store, organise, and even find and work           |
| 01:10:15   | with your documents. The AI is spooky good. It finds terms that aren't even in the documents,            |
| 01:10:21   | but still relevant. And I love that I can add my own personal password to the encryption layer           |
| 01:10:26   | to keep things just for me. You can get DEVONthink with 10% off right now or upgrade to it right         |

| 01:10:45   | automators and all of Relay FM. Before we went to the break Rose was teasing us about the remote         |
| 01:10:52   | app. So [[Alfred]], if you want to spend another $5 has an application you can get from the App Store        |
| 01:10:57   | for your iPhone or iPad, but I think it's really ideally made for the phone. And once you set            |
| 01:11:02   | it up, you have to have your Mac and your phone on the same Wi-Fi network. And if you go into that,      |
| 01:11:09   | you know, command space command comma, I should stop saying that, but I can't help myself.               |
| 01:11:13   | There is a remote tab in there and you can pair your phone to your Mac. And when you do that,            |
| 01:11:20   | it gives you the ability to remotely control your Mac via [[Alfred]]. Now, we've talked about                |
| 01:11:26   | remote control to your Mac on various episodes of automators. And sometimes it involves like             |
| 01:11:31   | running a remote server or some, some different thing. I feel like [[Alfred]] is actually a very             |
| 01:11:35   | easy way to do this. And, and there's a whole like category of third party apps that do this as          |
| 01:11:41   | well. But once again, if you're already in the ecosystem of [[Alfred]], why not just do it via [[Alfred]]?       |
| 01:11:48   | Historically, I, and Rose and I were talking before the show, neither one of us were big                 |
| 01:11:52   | fans of this historically, because it just felt like it was kind of a clunky app. But                    |
| 01:11:57   | between the last time I used it and prepping for today's show, they have spent a lot of time and         |
| 01:12:03   | effort. And it's actually a very nice looking app now. It is, it is. Because I mean, previously,         |
| 01:12:08   | it wasn't optimised for face ID phones and things like that. And the [[Alfred]] team were aware of it.       |
| 01:12:13   | And so I'm very pleased that they, they've updated it as well. You know, they've made the                |
| 01:12:18   | decision to stop, to temporarily pause, I guess, for a little while on the Mac application and           |
| 01:12:23   | devote some time to the iOS app. And it shows, it's nice. So by default, when you first set              |
| 01:12:28   | it up, you just get some system controls, which allows you to do things like show [[Alfred]], quit           |
| 01:12:33   | all your applications, eject all hard drives. That's something you can do with [[Alfred]]. That's            |
| 01:12:38   | one of the system commands that David mentioned before the outbreak. And that's a great command          |
| 01:12:43   | if you have a laptop that you usually keep plugged in, but you pick up and take with you,                |
| 01:12:49   | you know, before you pick it up and take it with you, eject all your hard drives, you don't              |
| 01:12:52   | want data corruption, right? So, you know, you eject all your hard drives, you can just eject            |
| 01:12:57   | all of them at the same time with [[Alfred]]. You can also open your screensaver, show the trash,            |
| 01:13:03   | or my favourite one, empty the trash, if it's in the trash, bye-bye. Lock yourself out,                   |
| 01:13:08   | useful for shared machines, of course, sleep the computer, lock the computer, restart and even           |
| 01:13:13   | shut down your computer. Of course, if you restart, you're going to have to come back to your computer   |
| 01:13:17   | and type in your password, please, I hope you've got a password on the keyboard connected to your        |
| 01:13:23   | machine before you can remote back in via the [[Alfred]] app at any rate. But it's great. But then,          |
| 01:13:30   | if you're liking the sound of this and you think, oh, well, what else can it do under the remote         |
| 01:13:38   | entry in the [[Alfred]] preferences, command space, command comma. So, remote is the fifth one down          |
| 01:13:44   | on the left. You can then use the little plus button at the bottom to add more under examples.           |
| 01:13:49   | There's also applications, which is your applications, preferences, folders and files,                   |
| 01:13:54   | web searches, bookmarks, music control and clipboard snippets. And each of these gives you               |
| 01:14:02   | a 16 button pane. So, you can also add, there's also workflows and blank pages. So, if you added         |
| 01:14:09   | a blank page, you'd get a grid of 16 buttons. And those 16 buttons, you can program.                     |
| 01:14:17   | Oh, wow, David, you can do anything you like. You can run an AppleScript command,                       |
| 01:14:20   | terminal command, keyboard combination. You can trigger a specific [[Alfred]] workflow. We're going          |
| 01:14:25   | to have to talk about those in a minute. You can open [[Alfred]] preferences. You can do                     |
| 01:14:32   | anything you like. Open URLs, open files. You name it, David. It's here.                                 |
| 01:14:38   | Honestly, I don't see myself using any of that stuff except for the system commands. I'm going           |
| 01:14:43   | to use, I would rather just remote in something with Jump Desktop and run my Mac remotely. But           |
| 01:14:50   | what it is useful for is just the other night, my studio now is downstairs because of the pandemic.      |
| 01:14:57   | I had to move out of a bedroom and I happened to leave the speakers on. My computer has external         |
| 01:15:04   | speakers and I was upstairs in bed and somebody was talking on [[Slack]]. All I could hear was the           |
| 01:15:11   | [[Slack]] noises. I didn't have any device with me. And I was thinking, it's going to be bugging             |
| 01:15:16   | everybody in the house. So, I went downstairs and fixed it. But I could have just, if I had this         |
| 01:15:21   | installed at the time, I could have muted my computer. It would be that easy. Or sleep the               |
| 01:15:26   | screen. I think it's useful for the system stuff. I don't think I will go very far down the              |
| 01:15:33   | rabbit hole on the rest of it. What I can see this being useful for me is setting up for podcasts        |
| 01:15:39   | and things like that. So, frequently, just because of time zone differences, before I podcast,           |
| 01:15:44   | before I recorded automators today, I was in the kitchen. I cooked dinner and I ate dinner.              |
| 01:15:48   | And I wasn't in my office. And I had to come back to my office to trigger my automation                  |
| 01:15:54   | for starting a podcast, which cleared a bunch of open applications, open specific applications,          |
| 01:15:59   | and then used [[Moom]] to put them in the right place. Well, with [[Alfred]], I can now do that                  |
| 01:16:04   | for my phone. Because previously, I could have got out my iPad and used Remote, Jump Desktop or            |
| 01:16:09   | something. But by the time I've done that, I could walk to my Mac, press command space,                  |
| 01:16:14   | type the command and walk away again. It's not worth it for things like that. But with [[Alfred]],           |
| 01:16:20   | I can definitely do that. Because I'll just have setups folder here now. And I'm going to be using       |
| 01:16:29   | this. I'm going to have to report back on this in the next show, David, where I'll be able to            |
| 01:16:33   | just say, automators or nested folders, iOS today, and things like that. And it means also, then         |
| 01:16:40   | when I get to my Mac, it's, you love contextual computing. My Mac is already going to be in              |
| 01:16:46   | the context that I need when I get to it because I'll press the button on my way there. So,              |
| 01:16:50   | I'm quite happy about that. That's a Stream Deck problem for me. But I get it. I mean,                   |
| 01:16:55   | I think it's cool. I think if you're doing remote stuff, the more ways you have to control your          |
| 01:17:00   | computer or the better. And honestly, remote control, belt and suspenders is a really good               |
| 01:17:08   | idea. Because sometimes something for one reason or another just doesn't work.                           |
| 01:17:12   | Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, I'm definitely going to keep it around for the system things. Because,             |
| 01:17:16   | like you said, you know, with with slack going, or whatever that sound is, I don't even remember         |
| 01:17:21   | now what the sound is. I just, I know it when I hear it. And like my spine does this weird thing         |
| 01:17:26   | where it's like, no, you know, when I'm not at my computer and somebody starts eagerly chatting with     |
| 01:17:31   | me, despite the fact that they're not getting a response. If you're not getting a response people,       |
| 01:17:37   | yeah. But so this way I can just pull out my phone, mute my machine, and go back to doing                |
| 01:17:43   | whatever it was I was doing. [[Alfred]] workflows. Now, this is something I've been waiting the whole        |
| 01:17:49   | show to talk about. [[Alfred]], I believe it was with version three that they first brought this in,         |
| 01:17:55   | but it got better with version four, where people can write their own little mini programs to run        |
| 01:18:02   | inside [[Alfred]] and give it like superpowers. So like the simplest one that I have, just to kind           |
| 01:18:10   | of give you an introduction to is called time zones. And what it does is I have set it up. So            |
| 01:18:16   | if I just type TZ when I open [[Alfred]], it gives me the time zone in Memphis, London and Taipei.           |
| 01:18:23   | I have three people I work with, you'll never guess who's in London or outside of London.                |
| 01:18:29   | But I just type TZ and it gives me the current time in those places. And it's the fastest way            |
| 01:18:36   | to get time zone information from me because it's like command space TZ, you know, and,                  |
| 01:18:40   | and then there's more you can do with this, you can add cities, remove cities, you can do all sorts      |
| 01:18:45   | of cool things. You can get the time zone in a random city. But I just find this a very useful           |
| 01:18:51   | thing. And it's a plugin that somebody wrote like five years ago, and you download it, you install       |
| 01:18:57   | it into [[Alfred]] and configure it and you're off to the races. And these workflows are,                    |
| 01:19:03   | are really what brought me out of [[LaunchBar]], because the workflow community in [[Alfred]] is so              |
| 01:19:09   | good and there are so many different things at stake. So I thought it'd be, I've been dying all          |
| 01:19:15   | week to find out what Rose is using for her [[Alfred]] workflows, but I've got several I like too.           |
| 01:19:20   | You want to share one of your favourites? I mean, I love those. So do I get to dive right into the        |
| 01:19:27   | weeds now? David or do you want one of my simpler ones to start with? Yeah, you can have a simple        |
| 01:19:31   | one. Let's try this. Okay. Well, one of my simple ones is with [[Yoink]]. So I mentioned this before,        |
| 01:19:36   | but in [[Yoink]]'s preferences, so [[Yoink]] is a Mac application, which is a shelf. And I have it               |
| 01:19:41   | appear over on the left side of my screen, my start dragging a file, because then I can shove            |
| 01:19:46   | that file in [[Yoink]]. And this is really useful. It doesn't actually, the file doesn't actually            |
| 01:19:49   | move to [[Yoink]]. It just basically a shortcut to the file lives there. And then you can drag it off        |
| 01:19:54   | to wherever later. And this can be useful for a variety of things. But finding files by digging          |
| 01:20:00   | through Finder is one of my least favourite things to do. You know, I just, I don't really do it.         |
| 01:20:06   | And so I usually find it with [[Alfred]]. And then I have [[Yoink]] as one of my options there. So I can         |
| 01:20:13   | add that to [[Yoink]]. And this is specified as a file action. So under [[Yoink]]'s preferences,                 |
| 01:20:18   | you can actually specify to install this [[Alfred]] workflow. And I'd highly recommend doing that            |
| 01:20:25   | if you use [[Yoink]]. Yeah, okay. That's a good one. We talked, I think, on this show recently about         |
| 01:20:32   | how the ones that I'm really, I'm just a huge fan of the OmniFocus ones that were created by,            |
| 01:20:41   | name escapes me, Packal.                                                                                 |
| 01:20:45   | They're on the Packal website. Yeah. I don't remember exactly who created them,                          |
| 01:20:49   | but the link to those is in show notes. Yeah. The Packal OmniFocus scripts are game changer              |
| 01:20:56   | if you use OmniFocus because they use the dot command. So you type dot f space, and then you             |
| 01:21:03   | can search all the folders in OmniFocus or dot p and search all the projects and you get it, you         |
| 01:21:08   | know, OmniFocus is great. But I am often not an OmniFocus when I think of something I want to see        |
| 01:21:14   | in OmniFocus and being able to like, I'll say dot f and then a client name and enter and it opens        |
| 01:21:20   | up OmniFocus to the specific client folder. And it's that fast. And I've not found any faster            |
| 01:21:26   | way to get to a target location in OmniFocus than that short of, you know, saving the URL to that        |
| 01:21:31   | place. And boy, I installed that and like within a day I was sold. Yeah. So the plugin itself is         |
| 01:21:38   | actually created by, I think, Reed Lewis, R-H-Y-D. And it's on GitHub as well. So I've linked to         |
| 01:21:45   | your blog post about it, David, the page on Packal. Packal is kind of like a library for                 |
| 01:21:51   | [[Alfred]] workflows. Some of them can sometimes be a little bit out of date. So check to see when           |
| 01:21:55   | things were last updated there. If you're struggling with something not working for whatever             |
| 01:22:01   | reason, but then it's also on GitHub. So I've got that linked to for people.                             |
| 01:22:06   | If I ever meet Reed, I am buying him a beer. Let's just put it out there. If you're listening,           |
| 01:22:11   | let me know. Well, one of the other things that you can do with [[Alfred]], and I believe this is a          |
| 01:22:18   | script that I got from Packal, I'm going to have to search for it now because I've had it for ages,      |
| 01:22:22   | is VPN connections. So I mean, I do use things like ExpressVPN. They're sponsoring the show.             |
| 01:22:29   | But I also have my work VPN and things like that, which I need to be able to do my job. But sometimes    |
| 01:22:35   | I have different VPNs because I need to access different parts of things and complex, weird              |
| 01:22:40   | networks. So I can't just say connect the VPN and be done with it, because that is almost                |
| 01:22:47   | certainly going to land me in the wrong network if I do that, because it's always going to be            |
| 01:22:50   | specialist. So I have a [[Alfred]] command, which lists the VPN options set up in my system preferences      |
| 01:22:57   | under my network. And then I pick one, and then it connects me. And this is great. So I do have          |
| 01:23:04   | a default VPN connection, which I've just set to works VPN, because, you know, most of the time,         |
| 01:23:09   | I can probably get away with just being in works VPN for things. And I try to encourage                  |
| 01:23:14   | whole the different departments to just put things in the main VPN, wherever possible,                   |
| 01:23:18   | instead of sub private things. But for those times when I can't do that, where people insist             |
| 01:23:23   | that their data has to be in a super secure internal private network, which cannot be accessed           |
| 01:23:28   | from the bigger network or whatever, then I have separate VPN. So being able to list those out has       |
| 01:23:33   | been really helpful for me. Another one for me is Dev and think search. There is a Dev and think         |
| 01:23:39   | three shirts by I think Charles Ma. And it does a great job you install and there's different            |
| 01:23:44   | parameters you can pass to it, like DNF say searches your favourites and Dev and think or,                |
| 01:23:50   | you know, D&T is the standard search. But it's a, it's an excellent way kind of like the way I use       |
| 01:23:57   | the on me focus search. You know, if I can search an app from anywhere on my computer, despite in        |
| 01:24:02   | command space, why not be able to do searches inside apps and have a lot of data and Dev and think,      |
| 01:24:08   | and I want to drill to a specific location. That's where [[Alfred]] kind of lends a hand and it saves        |
| 01:24:13   | me the trouble of finding the app, opening the app and then drilling through that, you know,             |
| 01:24:18   | left menu to find where I wanted to be. Yeah. So David, do I get to get really nerdy now on some         |
| 01:24:25   | of these workflows? Yeah, let's hear one. So we had a great guest on the show a couple of months         |
| 01:24:29   | back [[Stephen Millard]]. And he's recently created two amazing workflows. one of them's for [[Keyboard Maestro]]               |
| 01:24:37   | and one of them's for [[Drafts]]. Okay, so for [[Keyboard Maestro]], David, we have a conductor,                 |
| 01:24:43   | and for [[Drafts]], we have a doctor, [[Doctor Drafts]], and our [[Conductor]] for [[Keyboard Maestro]]. And I'll        |
| 01:24:47   | put links to both of his blog posts about these in the show notes. But basically, it means if I          |
| 01:24:52   | press command space and type doctor, as in DR, and then press space, I get a whole bunch of options,     |
| 01:24:58   | new draft, new draft, and open the new draft instead of leaving it in the background, append to a draft, |
| 01:25:03   | prepend to a draft, dictate to a draft, find a draft by content, copy a draft's URL, copy a draft's      |
| 01:25:08   | content, find draft by title, and about what feels like 8 million other options. And the                 |
| 01:25:16   | [[Keyboard Maestro]] one is pretty much or very similar in that it, you know, offers me all of these         |
| 01:25:23   | choices. And so I can do a very similar thing with this with [[Conductor]]. For that, you start              |
| 01:25:33   | it with KM, unfortunately, you don't write [[Conductor]], but then I get a list of my keyboard               |
| 01:25:37   | maestro macros right there. So I can specify the automators episode number. I did that at the            |
| 01:25:41   | beginning of the show, David. I used KM and then command seven, because that's my seventh macro          |
| 01:25:47   | there. And that's it. You know, and I just typed in the episode number and I was done.                   |
| 01:25:51   | Yeah, I mean, he, I think he told us he was working on them, but it's amazing to me how                  |
| 01:25:56   | advanced they are, you know, the [[Drafts]] one in particular. But keyboard launching [[Keyboard Maestro]]               |
| 01:26:02   | scripts from [[Alfred]] is really powerful. And there have been workflows in the past,               |
| 01:26:08   | but none of them are as good as his. I mean, this is the one you want.                                   |
| 01:26:12   | Yeah, I mean, I created a couple of macros when [[Drafts]] for Mac first launch.                             |
| 01:26:16   | And it was good. And things were fine. And, you know, everything was okay. But this is                   |
| 01:26:24   | just so much better. So much better. So, you know, that that's what I like. It's incredibly              |
| 01:26:32   | powerful. And I must see even smash to do here as well. I would encourage people if they're              |
| 01:26:37   | thinking about creating a [[Drafts]] and [[Drafts]] at [[Alfred]] workflow themselves, have a quick look             |
| 01:26:44   | at what he's done here, go, wow, amazing. And then go have a look at one of the simpler ones             |
| 01:26:51   | to get started, like the dev and think search. I mean, that one's still kind of complicated,             |
| 01:26:54   | but send to [[Yoink]], for example, that's a two action workflow. It has your file action,                    |
| 01:27:00   | which is your trigger, and then it's got an apple script. Okay, time zones, a little bit more            |
| 01:27:06   | complicated because you've got multiple triggers. But there, there's some great resources on the         |
| 01:27:11   | [[Alfred]] website, which I've linked to in the show notes for everybody, so that you can see,               |
| 01:27:18   | you know, how to create one. But it is kind of amazing that, you know, you can do all of this.           |
| 01:27:26   | I have a little one actually here. And I'm going to see if I can find the link to this,                  |
| 01:27:30   | because I've stolen it from somewhere, I can tell where if I type to do space and then something,        |
| 01:27:36   | it just adds an OmniFocus task in my inbox. It doesn't pop open or OmniFocus or quick capture            |
| 01:27:41   | or anything like that. It just checks it in my inbox and I'm done with it. Things like that              |
| 01:27:45   | make my life much easier. I have, I've been playing, there are some people developing                    |
| 01:27:51   | around [[Obsidian]] workflows for [[Alfred]]. And the ones that are out there yet, I haven't found               |
| 01:27:57   | what they do are not things I really want. So it's not really out there. But the way I've been           |
| 01:28:03   | automating [[Obsidian]] with [[Alfred]] is I have a web search. We talked earlier about custom web               |
| 01:28:07   | search as well [[Obsidian]] has a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]. So I've got one that it doesn't start with HTTP,               |
| 01:28:14   | it starts with [[Obsidian]] colon slash slash, but it does an [[Obsidian]] search. And that I find that          |
| 01:28:22   | useful. And I just tie it to the, to the letter O. But the, but I haven't really got an [[Obsidian]]         |
| 01:28:28   | workflow when I'm, I hope some of the nerds out there that are listening that are into [[Obsidian]]          |
| 01:28:33   | will come up with some good ones. I'm not going to make one. I'm not good enough to make one.            |
| 01:28:37   | But the, I do hope that, that something cool comes up. Another one I have that I would share             |
| 01:28:43   | is one that I customised based on the ones that ship with [[Alfred]]. [[Alfred]] has like some search,           |
| 01:28:50   | like if you hit the little plus button at the bottom of the workflow screen,                             |
| 01:28:53   | there's a bunch of like getting started an example and template scripts you can install,                 |
| 01:28:58   | they cover a lot of things. And I don't remember where I got this specific one,                          |
| 01:29:02   | but it was a folder search, which I thought was a really good idea. But then I, I made versions of       |
| 01:29:08   | it, like search particular groups of folders, like, let's say you've got a folder with all your          |
| 01:29:13   | client files in it. So you could have it trigger with CL and just search that folder where the           |
| 01:29:19   | client folders are and just give you folder lists. So you can get to folders. I mean,                    |
| 01:29:23   | actually keep a lot of this stuff in Dev and think, but if you kept it on your,                          |
| 01:29:27   | on your native drive or even on your iCloud drive, this would give you a quick way to                    |
| 01:29:32   | get to them. Yeah. I'm actually just looking through here, David. And I've got one that I                |
| 01:29:37   | created myself. It's called lullaby. And the idea is it's putting my Mac to sleep. But before it         |
| 01:29:43   | puts my Mac to sleep, it runs an [[AppleScript]] command. And it says, you know, when, when the             |
| 01:29:48   | alpha script happens, check if iTunes is running. So you can tell how long I've had this because         |
| 01:29:53   | I haven't upgraded it to [[Apple Music]], but it does fortunately still work. It says if, if the player      |
| 01:29:59   | state is playing, then pause it. So make sure to pause music. It says the volume with the output         |
| 01:30:05   | muted. And then it actually turns off [[Amphetamine]]. That's the application I usually use to keep my       |
| 01:30:11   | Mac awake. And then it starts the screensaver. And then it closes the script. And then after             |
| 01:30:16   | that, it runs the system command to sleep. And I don't quite remember why I'm actually                   |
| 01:30:23   | starting the screensaver here. I think for a while I had sleep disabled, because I was using this        |
| 01:30:28   | at work. And I didn't want my Mac to be going to sleep every time I walked away, but I did want to       |
| 01:30:32   | lock it. And starting the screensaver, of course, both, you know, hides my desktop so people can         |
| 01:30:38   | snoop around and do stuff not that people ever did that at work. It was more at the point of we          |
| 01:30:42   | weren't supposed to just leave things open and unlocked. And then, of course, enabled the lock           |
| 01:30:46   | for me after five seconds, which is quite nice, because your screensaver preferences can lock            |
| 01:30:52   | after a delay. You can do that with [[Alfred]] as well, actually. But I like the fact that the               |
| 01:30:57   | screensaver was on so people would assume it was already locked. And then it would give me a couple      |
| 01:31:01   | of seconds to walk away. And voila, then it would actually be locked. And then if I realised, as I       |
| 01:31:06   | stood up, oh, no, actually, I just quickly need to hit send on this, then I could do that. And I         |
| 01:31:11   | wouldn't have to unlock all the time. There's just so many rows. I mean, there's conversion tools.       |
| 01:31:17   | There's, I mean, there's utilities. I mean, there's so much functionality you can add to your            |
| 01:31:22   | computer all under the command space button. Yeah. Yeah. And I love [[Alfred]]. And, Dave,                   |
| 01:31:30   | we've not even really got into the weeds of creating workflows and things like that. I mean,             |
| 01:31:35   | we've got a whole bunch of things here in our outline that we've not yet touched on.                     |
| 01:31:38   | We've been talking for quite a while already. Yeah. Let's take a minute to talk through the              |
| 01:31:42   | settings a little bit that we haven't kind of covered already. There's a couple things in                |
| 01:31:47   | here I think that would be fun to kind of just cover. The first is, and we kind of already did           |
| 01:31:53   | cover this, but when you set it up, you want to put spotlight under option space and then                |
| 01:32:00   | [[Alfred]] under command space. And the way to do that is first you move spotlight. It gets very             |
| 01:32:06   | confused if you move, if you try to move [[Alfred]] to the same key as spotlight. So first you move          |
| 01:32:11   | spotlight to option command in spotlight. So you open spotlight, hit command, comment, that app,         |
| 01:32:16   | change the trigger to option space, and then that frees up command space for [[Alfred]].                     |
| 01:32:23   | The couple other things in the general where you talked about, make sure you set your country.           |
| 01:32:31   | What about appearance? [[Alfred]] has a bunch of different themes. Do you have a...                          |
| 01:32:35   | So I mean, I'm using, I think it's [[[Alfred]] purple](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/4028-minimal-purple-alfred-theme/) version two by @ianisted. And I don't remember         |
| 01:32:43   | now if this is a default one or if it's one that you need to install. But under [[Alfred]]'s appearance,     |
| 01:32:51   | you can also control a whole bunch of other things as well. So if you go into the appearance one,        |
| 01:32:57   | it's the paint roller, then you can have a look through. There's a whole bunch of themes on              |
| 01:33:04   | various websites out there. And [[Alfred]]'s natively got light themes and dark themes and                   |
| 01:33:09   | modern themes with more rounded corners, a classic one, which has a kind of                              |
| 01:33:15   | dark translucent gray chunky border around things, a macOS one, which is very Big Sur.                   |
| 01:33:23   | And of course, macOS dark. And once you've found your theme, then if you tap on or click on the          |
| 01:33:30   | options, you get some extra things as well. So you can hide the hat on the [[Alfred]] window.                |
| 01:33:36   | So when you press command space, I like looking at the hat. Okay, I like the little                      |
| 01:33:41   | bowler hat with the purple band and the magnifying glasses, kind of, you know,                           |
| 01:33:46   | show a lot of clumsy. And I like the fact that it's [[Alfred]]. But you can hide that if you don't           |
| 01:33:51   | like it, if you want things to be more minimal. You can also hide your result shortcuts. And the         |
| 01:33:58   | result shortcuts means the command and the number. So if I was talking about that earlier in your        |
| 01:34:03   | diagram, I don't see that you've probably hidden that with this option. And you can talk about           |
| 01:34:09   | that on and off per theme. Okay. So make sure that you change that. This is also where you               |
| 01:34:15   | hide or unhide the menu bar icon. I believe [[Alfred]]'s menu bar icon is hidden by default.                 |
| 01:34:22   | And you can always, you know, get it back. I quite like having it. I've got it hidden in                 |
| 01:34:27   | bartender. But it's, you know, it's useful to have. And then under this, I mean,                         |
| 01:34:36   | there's a whole bunch of options in here, we can talk about this for hours, David.                       |
| 01:34:39   | There's a show result subtext. Okay, so the result subtext is, so for example,                           |
| 01:34:46   | I open [[Alfred]] command space, I type preview to find preview. Okay, by default, if I hit return,          |
| 01:34:52   | I open preview. If I press command, then with the subtext on, it shows me that I'm revealing that        |
| 01:35:00   | file in Finder. If I press option, I'm searching for what I've typed in spotlight. If I press control,   |
| 01:35:06   | I'm searching it with my default fallback. And I think there's, I think that that's it                   |
| 01:35:13   | as far as these actions go. But you can have this, the subtext shown all of the time,                    |
| 01:35:19   | only for alternative actions, and only for your selective results, or never. You can also choose         |
| 01:35:26   | what, how many items you want to show. So I'm showing nine items, you might only want to show            |
| 01:35:30   | three or five. I've recently been doing a lot of things with a lot of documents needing like 12          |
| 01:35:35   | documents at a time. So I've got it set to nine, just because it makes my life a bit easier.             |
| 01:35:40   | But yeah, you can show scroll indicators, automatically highlight the top results.                       |
| 01:35:46   | If it focuses as a standard mode or compatibility mode, that's explained right there. You can also       |
| 01:35:51   | choose to move [[Alfred]]. So if you always want it to appear over on the left of your screen,               |
| 01:35:56   | you can do that. And then you can just drag it, and [[Alfred]] will always appear on the left.               |
| 01:36:00   | I personally like it to appear fairly central, a little higher up, which is the default location.        |
| 01:36:07   | So, you know, I've dragged that on in this little preview. And you can also specify                      |
| 01:36:13   | which screen you want [[Alfred]] to display on. So if you've got six screens, okay, this is kind of          |
| 01:36:19   | crazy. But if you had six screens, you can say, Hey, can you show [[Alfred]] on whichever screen my          |
| 01:36:25   | mouse is on, please? Or whichever screen is currently active. So if I'm currently using an               |
| 01:36:30   | application on screen three, even if my mouse is on screen six, I want it to open on screen three.       |
| 01:36:36   | You can do that. And yeah, that's pretty useful if you're working multiple screens,                      |
| 01:36:40   | I recommend that. The active screen option messes with my head a little bit,                             |
| 01:36:46   | because I don't always remember where it is. But the mouse screen can be quite useful if you're          |
| 01:36:50   | specifically, you know, working over on your second screen for a minute or two. And then,                |
| 01:36:55   | you know, you move your mouse over there and you do [[Alfred]], and you don't want to have to                |
| 01:36:57   | move your head backwards all the time to your main screen, then that's great.                            |
| 01:37:01   | Yeah, I mean, the crazy thing is that these things are buried in these options. I mean,                  |
| 01:37:06   | it's very easy to miss them. I think, like, I, for instance, don't like the bowler hat,                  |
| 01:37:12   | you know, so I turn it off, but you got to like go to appearance and there's a little                    |
| 01:37:16   | options button in the bottom corner. I mean, it's like you, you wouldn't even know it's there.           |
| 01:37:20   | So, so be you have to spelunk a little bit through these, these options.                                 |
| 01:37:27   | But it's totally worth it. Let's talk for a minute about sync, because I think Rose mentioned            |
| 01:37:34   | earlier that you can turn sync on and, you know, customising [[Alfred]], if you get into this is             |
| 01:37:41   | something you're going to do. You're going to be fiddling with the options, getting the right            |
| 01:37:44   | themes, getting the right workflows installed. And then if for some reason, you know, your               |
| 01:37:49   | computer falls into a lake and you got to get new computer, rebuilding all that is going to be a         |
| 01:37:53   | massive pain in the neck. And with [[Alfred]] sync, they sync everything. I mean, so it's a great            |
| 01:38:00   | option, even if you just have one computer. Yeah. Yeah. So the way the sync works, under the,            |
| 01:38:08   | I want to say the advanced option, I was right, David, it's the advanced option. I'm winning here        |
| 01:38:12   | today. Under the advanced option in [[Alfred]] preferences, over bottom right hand side,                     |
| 01:38:18   | there is a syncing option. And you can set your preferences folder. Now, theoretically,                  |
| 01:38:23   | you can sync using any cloud service you like, but they do recommend [[Dropbox]]. I personally have          |
| 01:38:29   | always used [[Dropbox]] for the sync. I mean, I have two terabytes of [[Dropbox]] space, which I'm not using.    |
| 01:38:34   | So I try and shove as many things in there as possible. [[Alfred]] takes up practically no space             |
| 01:38:39   | at all because it's all text preferences. So I've set my preferences folder. And so it's syncing.        |
| 01:38:45   | In my case, it's inside of [[Dropbox]], application syncing [[Alfred]]. I think I created application            |
| 01:38:51   | syncing long ago for syncing a variety of applications, but that's where it is. And you                  |
| 01:38:56   | can also reveal that folder. This is also very useful when you're setting up a new Mac because,          |
| 01:39:02   | you know, I've got a shiny purple and one iMac coming, David, it's going to be great for podcasting      |
| 01:39:07   | because it's practically inaudible to the human ear. Seven decibels, that thing, runs out.               |
| 01:39:11   | That's what they say. Well, I think you're right there. Yeah, Daring Fireball's got the scoop there.     |
| 01:39:16   | So I'm looking forward to that. The Intel Mac Mini can get a little loud sometimes with                  |
| 01:39:21   | those fans spinning. So, you know, when I set up [[Alfred]] on that machine, which is going to be one        |
| 01:39:26   | of the first apps that I set up, then I'm just going to be able to pull in those preferences             |
| 01:39:30   | and just go yank. Thank you very much. I will take everything from [[Dropbox]].                              |
| 01:39:34   | And that nice purple theme you have is going to fit right in.                                            |
| 01:39:38   | Yep, exactly. Also, in the advanced section, you can set what control return, option return,             |
| 01:39:45   | and command return do. So the options for these are searching with your default web search,              |
| 01:39:50   | searching a finder, revealing a finder, actioning your visible results, and showing your results         |
| 01:39:58   | subtext. And this means, say, for example, I have the action visible results enabled,                    |
| 01:40:06   | and I type, I don't know, preview. And then I set this one to command return, then it shows me,          |
| 01:40:13   | you know, the various options. And now it's doing some crazy things because I accidentally               |
| 01:40:18   | selected marked instead of preview because marked previews, markdown files, which is why it shows        |
| 01:40:22   | up there. Yeah, you know, there's just so much you can do with [[Alfred]]. I was just looking at the         |
| 01:40:29   | themes list a minute ago. Did you ever use [[Quicksilver]]? Was that before your time? No.                   |
| 01:40:37   | So [[Quicksilver]], I think, was going out of favor, hadn't been updated for a while,                        |
| 01:40:42   | just as I was really starting to get nerdy with my Mac for a long time. I kept my Mac fairly,            |
| 01:40:47   | fairly stock. I had one of those amazing original MacBook Airs with the drop down door                   |
| 01:40:53   | for the ports, David. I love that thing. And yeah, and so for a while, I was just kind of excited        |
| 01:41:01   | about pages and numbers, to be honest. Is it weird that I was excited by a spreadsheet application       |
| 01:41:05   | because numbers is fun. Okay, start somewhere. I feel like [[Quicksilver]] had this great interface          |
| 01:41:11   | called the cube where it would open up. And as you work through the basic, the formula of whatever       |
| 01:41:18   | you're doing, it would spin the cube. I thought that was a great, I guess that's really not possible     |
| 01:41:22   | with [[Alfred]]. I'm going to write those guys. Man, I would love to see them figure out a way to do that.   |
| 01:41:27   | Have you checked on Packal? There might be a [[Quicksilver]] theme.                                            |
| 01:41:31   | Yeah, I'll have to look. I'll have to look. But I'm not even sure, even if they had a [[Quicksilver]],       |
| 01:41:36   | look at the cube, it's an animation built into. I'm not sure it would work. But either way, I            |
| 01:41:43   | guess the point being that the reason we give [[Alfred]] a whole show is because it needs a whole            |
| 01:41:48   | show. There's just so much to talk about here. We didn't get into today, multiple files, like where      |
| 01:41:54   | you can select multiple files and act on them. I think we're going to save that. I really wanted         |
| 01:41:58   | to get to that. Well, you want to talk about it for a minute. Let's just take a minute and talk          |
| 01:42:01   | about why not. I mean, one of the things you can do with [[Alfred]] is you can do file actions.              |
| 01:42:07   | But you don't necessarily just want to act on one file. Say, for example, you want to open               |
| 01:42:13   | multiple files. Instead of typing command space, open, searching for your file and pressing return.      |
| 01:42:18   | If you use the open command, by the way, then it's always going to open whatever it is that you've       |
| 01:42:23   | got after that rather than revealing and finding or whatever your default preferences are.               |
| 01:42:28   | But if you use, and I'm just going to have to check this now because it's the option up                  |
| 01:42:36   | arrow. So you press option up arrow, and it starts adding things above your current search.              |
| 01:42:47   | That means I can search for multiple things. Now, pressing option back                                   |
| 01:42:51   | arrow removes all of those. So like me, you usually use option backspace to backspace a word.            |
| 01:42:59   | Possibly unlearn that exclusively for [[Alfred]] if you're going to use this feature.                        |
| 01:43:04   | Then it will let you do this. And then you can do whatever your file action is.                          |
| 01:43:15   | I know some people, at one point, I used to have to print like 10 documents a week at work,              |
| 01:43:19   | and I had to print them all at the same time. So I would just find them with [[Alfred]] and I had a          |
| 01:43:22   | special thing, an automated workflow to print things. So I would just find them all and then             |
| 01:43:28   | press type print and print everything. It's a bit out on a food copier and staple it together for me.    |
| 01:43:33   | It was great. It's a great way to move things off your desktop. I mean, there's like a whole lot         |
| 01:43:37   | you can do with that. Yeah. It's great. So I've actually got a link in the show notes for people         |
| 01:43:43   | if they want to have a look at how they can get nerdy with files. It is something                        |
| 01:43:49   | that I think is perhaps better explained with screenshots as well. So yeah, enjoy diving into            |
| 01:43:55   | that, I would say. Yeah. Well, there's a lot to it. Let us know in the forums what you're doing          |
| 01:44:01   | with [[Alfred]], what's interesting and fun. This is very much an automation tool, as you've heard           |
| 01:44:07   | us talking about today. I know that without it, I would be a lot slower on my Mac.                       |
| 01:44:12   | Yeah, same, same. And it's amazing how many things integrate with [[Alfred]],                                |
| 01:44:16   | because essentially it's just searching your entire Mac for everything. It uses [[Spotlight]] as the         |
| 01:44:22   | back end. It integrates with 1Password. So you can actually search 1Password for a website and       |
| 01:44:26   | open it and fill it through [[Alfred]], because you've found it with 1Password. And so 1Password         |
| 01:44:31   | then tells your browser to open it and fills it in. We didn't even get to cover that. So yeah,           |
| 01:44:37   | there's plenty that you can get started with. Now, before we finish for today, I want to tell you        |
| 01:44:43   | about another podcast here on the Relay FM network. It's Make Do. If you like this show,                 |

| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators. I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                   |
| 00:07      | How are you today, Rosemary?                                                                              |
| 00:08      | I'm good, David. I lost some AirPods the other day, and so I ordered a case of an AirTag                  |
| 00:13      | holder, an AirTag. Found my AirPods. They're now in the case with the AirTag. So next time                |
| 00:17      | I lose them, I can automate finding them, which is great.                                                 |
| 00:20      | Wait, wait a second. So you lost the entire AirPods or just the case?                                     |
| 00:25      | Yeah, AirPods plus case.                                                                                  |
| 00:26      | Okay. Well, that hurts.                                                                                   |
| 00:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 00:29      | Well, the worst thing is, is when you open the AirPods case and there's one AirPod in                     |
| 00:33      | there, and you're like, oh boy. And the other one's not in your ear. Oh boy. Right?                       |
| 00:38      | Yep.                                                                                                      |
| 00:39      | So, but you can now get an AirPods case that has a holder for an AirTag.                                  |
| 00:44      | Huh?                                                                                                      |
| 00:45      | Yeah, yeah. There's a Spigen one for the AirPods Pro, but I just grabbed, they have some little          |
| 00:50      | ones with keychains on the side. So I just charged an AirTag on that because that works                   |
| 00:53      | for me.                                                                                                   |
| 00:54      | Well, if only the same company made the AirTags and AirPods, then they could combine the AirTag           |
| 00:59      | technology into the AirPod case, but...                                                                   |
| 01:02      | It's insane.                                                                                              |
| 01:03      | Yeah. But hey, we are the automators. We're not here to talk about AirPods and AirTags.                   |
| 01:07      | We're here to talk about automation. And we have an excellent guest today. Welcome to                     |
| 01:12      | the show, Chris Lawley.                                                                                   |
| 01:13      | Hey, thank you guys for having me on. Excellent guest. Woo. That's, that's some pressure right            |
| 01:17      | there.                                                                                                    |
| 01:18      | Well, it's on, baby, because you are a content creator of Summary Now. Now, gang, if you like             |
| 01:24      | your iPad, just, you know, pause the show right now, go over to YouTube and search out Chris              |
| 01:30      | Lawley's YouTube channel. We'll put a link in the show notes, see if it will make it                      |
| 01:33      | easy for you.                                                                                             |
| 01:34      | Chris is one of the premier, I would say, iPad YouTubers out there because he runs primarily              |
| 01:43      | on iPad and has a lot of great content on it, using his iPad to get his work done. I once                 |
| 01:50      | stumbled into your video, Chris, how I found the, the Lawley verse was when I was looking                 |
| 01:57      | at iPad setups and you have a video where your whole desk setup and you've got like                       |
| 02:02      | a cool clicky keyboard and external monitor. And I really enjoyed watching your video about               |
| 02:07      | how you're using your iPad at your desk, but there's a whole bunch of more stuff there.                   |
| 02:10      | So if you guys are interested in that, but we wanted to have Chris on to talk about automation            |
| 02:14      | today. And, and he was nice enough to say yes.                                                            |
| 02:18      | Yeah. Thank, thank you so much for those words. Yeah. I do work primarily from the iPad and               |
| 02:24      | I enjoy it all the time and I do a lot of automation stuff from my iPad.                                  |
| 02:27      | Well, that's what we're here to talk about because I know I've seen quite a few of your                   |
| 02:32      | videos in some, Chris, I have to confess, I didn't watch everything in your back.                         |
| 02:35      | Oh, that's okay.                                                                                          |
| 02:36      | For the show.                                                                                             |
| 02:37      | That's okay.                                                                                              |
| 02:38      | But, you know, that, that's mostly because there's an awful lot there, which is of course                 |
| 02:42      | a good thing. But I know that you do have a lot of automation and I know that you've                      |
| 02:46      | talked to [[Matthew Cassinelli]] quite a bit as well, which is, I'm certain given new ideas,                  |
| 02:50      | same as you've given him ideas. And it's, it's always interesting seeing what different                   |
| 02:55      | people come up with to solve their problems and how their workflows work with these automations           |
| 03:00      | built in.                                                                                                 |
| 03:01      | Yeah. Matthew and I, him and I talk almost daily, especially over this beta period. And                   |
| 03:08      | him and I have just been like kind of running off of each other just with ideas. And we,                  |
| 03:14      | like, I brought a couple of things to talk about here today, but not even everything                      |
| 03:18      | that I've come up with that I can do with shortcuts in iOS and iPadOS 15. There's just                    |
| 03:24      | a lot of really cool stuff that's been added over this beta period, a lot of bugs too,                    |
| 03:29      | but a lot of really cool stuff. And I'm, I'm just super excited about this. I love automating             |
| 03:35      | stuff, anything that could speed up my workflow. I'm self employed now, since last December.              |
| 03:41      | So anything that could, you know, speed up my workflow, give me more time in my day.                      |
| 03:47      | I am down to do.                                                                                          |
| 03:49      | Well, you know, Rose and I have covered iOS 15 and shortcuts really kind of briefly right                 |
| 03:55      | after WWDC, but obviously things have been evolving. We're getting increasingly frequent                  |
| 04:02      | betas, which is always a sign that they're getting close to the end. And as we record                     |
| 04:07      | this, there's a, there's a heck of a rumor out there in a week or two, we're going to                     |
| 04:10      | have an Apple event to get the new iPhone and a release date for iOS 15. So that may                      |
| 04:18      | be out actually before the show releases.                                                                 |
| 04:20      | Oh, wow.                                                                                                  |
| 04:21      | We're jumping time here, guys, but either way. But Chris, what are you particularly                       |
| 04:27      | excited about with iOS 15 and shortcuts?                                                                  |
| 04:31      | There are a whole bunch of new actions that I'm really excited about. The big ones that                   |
| 04:35      | I've been asking for a while are files actions. So basically being able to move files around              |
| 04:40      | using shortcuts, you know, save stuff, delete stuff, all sorts of different files actions                 |
| 04:46      | there.                                                                                                    |
| 04:47      | I feel like on that, on that files action question, I really feel like this is a boom                     |
| 04:52      | from them adding shortcuts to the Mac. You know, we, I was hesitant to get shortcuts                      |
| 04:58      | on the Mac because I felt like the Mac already has so many automation tools. I wanted the                 |
| 05:02      | team, the shortcuts seem to spend all their time just making iPad and iPhone automation                   |
| 05:07      | better because I got it covered really already on the Mac. And, uh, but that was something                |
| 05:13      | I didn't expect. But in the effort of making file, they had to have file related automation               |
| 05:20      | on the Mac in order to make it work at all. But then once they added that, they're like,                  |
| 05:24      | Oh, why don't we just bring it back over to iPhone and iPad? And I do think you're right.                 |
| 05:28      | That is going to be a huge benefit for anybody that wants to work with files.                             |
| 05:32      | Yes. I've been playing around with [[Obsidian]] over the summer. It's still a little too                      |
| 05:37      | rough for me to go all in on it right now, especially on the iPad.                                        |
| 05:40      | Oh, Chris, Chris, Chris, you said the word [[Obsidian]]. Now the show is all [[Obsidian]]. Sorry,                 |
| 05:45      | gang. We've been the next two hours talking about [[Obsidian]].                                               |
| 05:48      | I'm, I'm really excited for that application. Their iPad app is still a little too rough                  |
| 05:54      | for me to go all in on it just yet. But the stuff that I've been seeing people do and                     |
| 06:00      | the stuff that I was playing around with over the summer with [[Obsidian]] and using those files              |
| 06:04      | actions because [[Obsidian]] just, you know, has folders and text files. That's it. You could                 |
| 06:09      | do some pretty cool stuff with it. But like the other actions that are in iOS 15 and stuff                |
| 06:15      | are, are like live text actions, the OCR features. That is awesome. I'm super excited                     |
| 06:23      | about that, especially the action that allows you, I'm blanking on what the actual name                   |
| 06:28      | is off top of my head right now, but basically allows you to pull a page from a PDF or pages              |
| 06:33      | like select the, you know, do you want the first page or you know, page 13 through 15                     |
| 06:39      | or whatever. I'm, I'm pretty excited for those just because I get a lot of PDF documents                  |
| 06:44      | and this may, you know, this helps trim those down because a lot of those have extra fluff                |
| 06:49      | in them that is not necessary.                                                                            |
| 06:51      | Yeah. The number of times I've been given a PDF and every fourth page is blank or something               |
| 06:56      | because they intended this to be printed or whatever it is. No, I, I'm not printing                       |
| 07:01      | this. I've got an iPad pro with an Apple Pen. So why would I print this?                                  |
| 07:05      | Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Being able to take advantage of that. And yeah, the split PDF document               |
| 07:09      | into pages action is, is great. I was actually using previously, I was always hacking the                 |
| 07:14      | make PDF action where you could include specific pages, page range, which would help, but you             |
| 07:22      | would have to repeat multiple times to get multiple page ranges. And it was just frustrating.             |
| 07:27      | So I'm glad that we now have the, the split option.                                                       |
| 07:30      | And again, that is another, I guess I'm the Mac advocate today, but that's another thing                  |
| 07:35      | that we got because those tools were an automator. And, you know, one of the things with shortcuts        |
| 07:40      | on the Mac is they want it to eventually replace automators. So they're pulling those actions             |
| 07:44      | over and we got a whole PDF suite now on iPad and iPhone. It's like, awesome. You know,                   |
| 07:51      | all this stuff is, I'm really happy with the state of shortcuts. You know, I mean, when                   |
| 07:57      | you think about when Apple bought it, and everybody was like, Oh, that's that, you know,                  |
| 08:02      | they're going to put those guys, you know, those guys are going to be working on font                     |
| 08:05      | implementation in numbers or something. They're not going to be making automation tools anymore.          |
| 08:10      | And no, they really just let them run. I feel like this is Apple at its best, you know,                   |
| 08:16      | bringing in an outside company and then putting their cool tool inside the operating system.              |
| 08:21      | Yeah, 100%. I, I'm so excited the, the, the jumps that shortcuts has made every single                    |
| 08:29      | year since what was it iOS 12 that it was put in. I mean, that wasn't that long ago.                      |
| 08:36      | That was three years ago. And where we were and where we are now is just, it's, it's amazing.             |
| 08:43      | I mean, when workflow was purchased workflow, you know, third party apps had to work with                 |
| 08:49      | the workflow team to get their actions in there. And it was all X callback URL based.                     |
| 08:54      | And now we have parameters and all this fun stuff that I'm just super excited to dive                     |
| 08:58      | into. Yeah, it has iOS 15 updates to shortcuts given                                                      |
| 09:04      | you any shortcuts that you've always like wanted, but been unable to, to write.                           |
| 09:10      | Um, you know, some of the really interesting ones are kind of simple, like being able to                  |
| 09:16      | put apps in a [[Split View]] and [[Slide Over]] is really big. I work primarily from the iPad.                    |
| 09:22      | Um, and the multitasking implementation on the iPad is good, but my biggest issue with                    |
| 09:28      | it is when you create a [[Split View]] pair, it pulls the instance that you're putting in                     |
| 09:35      | that pair. It pulls the last instance used of that app that you're putting in the pair.                   |
| 09:40      | So if that instance of that app was already in [[Split View]] with another app, it was in                     |
| 09:44      | slide over or it had something full screen that you wanted to stay full screen. Well,                     |
| 09:49      | now that's in [[Split View]]. So with these actions, I'm able to kind of, you know, quickly put               |
| 09:55      | together these, these, um, workspaces that I use. So like I have draft [[Drafts]] and things                  |
| 10:00      | open a lot or things and fantastical. So like I just created a little shortcuts, um,                      |
| 10:06      | keyboard, um, what do they call them in iOS? I always forget it on the name, but basically                |
| 10:10      | keyboard shortcuts where you can like, uh, type in a phrase and then it auto fills the                    |
| 10:17      | replacement. Thank you. That's what it is. Um, so like I have a couple of those that                      |
| 10:22      | I can just type those and it'll just bring up things and fantastical or things and [[Drafts]]                |
| 10:27      | or whatever. The, those, those small little actions like that really do make a huge difference.           |
| 10:32      | All right. I need a little explanation on that. So you're using the text replacement                      |
| 10:36      | tool where you type a few letters and it blops out to a whole bunch of texts, but you're                  |
| 10:42      | using that to trigger the, the setups. Yes. I left out the key part using spotlight. So                   |
| 10:48      | you can trigger shortcuts via spotlight. Yeah. And, uh, actually, uh, former guest of your                |
| 10:54      | show was the one that gave me the idea for this [[Tim Nahumck]]. Uh, so basically you can                     |
| 10:58      | just hit command space. Um, for example, if I can hit T T and that'll fill in time tracking               |
| 11:04      | and hit enter and it'll run my time tracking shortcut. Nice. Right. That makes a lot of                   |
| 11:09      | sense. Yeah. That, so you're combining the, the text replacement with spotlight, which                    |
| 11:14      | yeah, got it because spotlight got better and you can run shortcuts from spotlight now.                   |
| 11:19      | Yes. I, I think they started doing that last year. Um, I've been doing it for a while,                    |
| 11:25      | but yeah, it's, I think that started last year, at least last year it ran, uh, without                    |
| 11:29      | opening the shortcuts app. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was super fun. Back when, every time                    |
| 11:35      | you ran a shortcut, it bounced you into the shortcuts app and then maybe the browser too,                 |
| 11:40      | just for fun. Oh yeah. Yeah. That was, yeah, that was the good old days. Yeah. Or, or back                |
| 11:47      | in the early workflow days, when anytime you installed the app, you had a, you had to build               |
| 11:52      | the, uh, make GIF short or workflow. Yeah. When you first installed it, I don't know                      |
| 11:57      | how many times I had to put together that shortcut or workflow, whatever. Yeah. I forgot about            |
| 12:03      | that. Yeah. That was pretty crazy. Yes. Yeah. I think they got rid of that fairly early on                |
| 12:07      | based on a lot of feedback in the, uh, the subreddit for workflow back in the day. Cause                  |
| 12:12      | uh, I remember being there and installing it on a new iPad or a new iPhone, having to                     |
| 12:17      | do it and just great. This is enough email, uh, and disappeared shortly afterwards. I'm                   |
| 12:21      | not going to claim credit for it disappearing. I think it was probably, you know, I, I've                 |
| 12:26      | owned release time or iPad release time and lots of people are getting new devices and                    |
| 12:30      | emailing them and they just went, whoa, okay, we're getting real list now. Yeah. Chris did                |
| 12:34      | say something that I want to like step back to, to look at closer. And that's the idea                    |
| 12:39      | that a lot of these new actions are really pretty simple when a lot of the better new                     |
| 12:44      | actions he's talking about are shortcuts are, are simple shortcuts that have one or two                   |
| 12:48      | steps taken advantage of these new actions. Like as an example of that would be setting                   |
| 12:53      | up your perfect setup, like maybe your task manager next to your calendar or [[Drafts]] next                  |
| 12:58      | to, you know, whatever. And, um, and the thing I want to point out about that, cause we                   |
| 13:04      | all, you know, we always self select as nerds and we bring in to the show, uh, really smart               |
| 13:10      | people like Chris and [[Tim Nahumck\|Tim]] who write these really advanced shortcuts that have, you know, sometimes        |
| 13:16      | hundreds of steps. But if you're listening to the show, understand that a lot of the                      |
| 13:22      | most useful shortcuts you're going to write are going to be five or less steps, probably                  |
| 13:26      | two or less steps really. Um, and, uh, you should not be intimidated by this stuff.                       |
| 13:32      | Well, just learn what the actions are and you can put together quick shortcuts that                       |
| 13:37      | really can, can change your day. You know,                                                                |
| 13:40      | I would say a vast majority of my shortcuts, at least more than 50% have five actions or                  |
| 13:46      | fewer. Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 13:47      | Yeah. Yeah. Mine are pretty much the same. I was going through looking at some, cause                     |
| 13:51      | I recently created, um, three shortcuts, which do almost exactly the same thing except, you               |
| 13:56      | know, the final result is, you know, I selected a different variable and I just wanted them               |
| 14:01      | as different shortcuts. Um, and, um, you know, I'm looking at those. So that's three shortcuts            |
| 14:05      | with four actions each in them, two actions, three actions. There's one here with 11 actions              |
| 14:10      | that I created for somebody else, uh, two actions, one action. All of these are really,                   |
| 14:16      | really short shortcuts, but they do exactly what it is I need them to do, which is of                     |
| 14:20      | course the brilliant thing.                                                                               |
| 14:22      | And with the new file management tools that kind of like really helps like if you're making               |
| 14:26      | a shortcut that makes a special kind of file, but maybe there's three different places                    |
| 14:30      | you may need to put that file, you know, based on your work requirements, you could just                  |
| 14:35      | make it once and then make two duplicates and just change the last step to put it in                      |
| 14:40      | a different folder. You've got three. So really the effort of making one shortcut, you made               |
| 14:44      | three and you've got one customised for each required result. And the stuff really is just,               |
| 14:51      | it's not that hard once you start digging in on it.                                                       |

| 16:37      | Chris, you were talking about using workflow back in the early days, but where did you                    |
| 16:42      | really get started in automation? What was the first automation you remember creating?                    |
| 16:47      | I don't really remember what exactly it was. I got really into XBMC, which is now Kodi,                   |
| 16:56      | which is kind of like a flavour or I think it was like the original version of Plex and                    |
| 17:01      | then branched off to it. Anyways, it was like a media centre and I remember vaguely                       |
| 17:08      | about making some kind of automation. I honestly don't remember how it worked at all, but it              |
| 17:13      | was like moving files around and renaming files because when it came to doing XBMC and                    |
| 17:18      | this is why I gave up on all that and Plex and all that stuff is it's so much management.                 |
| 17:25      | It's a lot of file management and things like that. I was using terrible hard drives that                 |
| 17:30      | were constantly crashing, so I was having to restore from backups and things like that.                   |
| 17:34      | It was a nightmare, but I kind of remember having to do something like that and I think                   |
| 17:39      | I did it with Automator, but I don't remember for sure, to be honest. It was years and years              |
| 17:44      | and years ago.                                                                                            |
| 17:46      | That makes sense. I do have my own Plex server and to nobody's surprise, I have highly automated          |
| 17:53      | my process for adding new media, so I rip it on my Mac. I give an approximate name,                       |
| 17:57      | mark it in a folder and say to some other applications, which then rename and organise                    |
| 18:03      | everything, hey, this show is here, grab it and do the magic for me, and then it actually                 |
| 18:09      | does it and it downloads all the metadata, does the proper renaming and everything tells                  |
| 18:14      | me, hey, there's a new season of this available, go by the DVD, which is perfect. That's really           |
| 18:20      | handy, but yeah, to set it up was a bit of work. Now it's up and running. I have no problems              |
| 18:26      | with the touch wood, but I can imagine that it is too much work, especially in a world                    |
| 18:30      | where Netflix probably has most things that you need.                                                     |
| 18:33      | Yeah, and at the time, what I was doing is using a service that sent DVDs to your house                   |
| 18:39      | and ripping them and putting them on my library and stuff like that. It was just a lot of                 |
| 18:48      | work and now I'm at the point where I'm like, if I want a movie, I can just rent it for                   |
| 18:51      | my tunes. That's fine.                                                                                    |
| 18:53      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 18:54      | Yeah, that was, if this stuff was working when my kids were younger, I would have gone                    |
| 18:59      | really deep down that rabbit hole because when your kids are little, they will watch                      |
| 19:04      | the same show like 50 times, but it really wasn't working. We just had the ability to                     |
| 19:10      | rip DVDs back then and the network that attached storage stuff really wasn't great, but as                |
| 19:18      | soon as the kids got older, I gave up on all that. Just the whole idea of managing it just                |
| 19:23      | gives me a headache. Yeah, I get it.                                                                      |
| 19:27      | But then at some point though, you had started this love affair with the iPad. How did that               |
| 19:32      | happen?                                                                                                   |
| 19:33      | Yeah. I first started, well, let me back up even a little further. I had an IT job when                   |
| 19:43      | I turned 21. I got my first IT job and it was just entry-level help desk stuff. I am                      |
| 19:50      | a creative person. I went to film school. I used to make short films. I have to do a                      |
| 19:56      | creative job and IT is about as far away from a creative job as you can get because it's                  |
| 20:02      | very procedural. These are the steps you need to follow. These are the things you need to                 |
| 20:06      | do every day and I was bored out of my mind.                                                              |
| 20:10      | I started a blog which was the entitled site and I started blogging and I realised I didn't               |
| 20:17      | enjoy writing or publishing writing. I always enjoyed making videos. I got the idea to make               |
| 20:24      | videos. I started up a YouTube channel and there I started talking about the iPad and                     |
| 20:30      | apps and all sorts of different things. It just became a huge love affair of just I truly                 |
| 20:38      | love computers and this is the thing I just enjoy doing. When I started my YouTube channel,               |
| 20:45      | I was managing it from a MacBook Pro but about 10 videos in, that's when an app called Luma               |
| 20:50      | Fusion came out. For those that don't know, LumaFusion is a multi-track video editor                     |
| 20:56      | that works on the iPad and the iPhone but it works best on the iPad just because of                       |
| 21:00      | screen real estate. When that came out, I was like, I could do my whole workflow on                       |
| 21:07      | the iPad. Was it easy? No because it was the days of iOS 9 or 10. It was still pretty                     |
| 21:16      | rough. We didn't have a files app and things like that. You couldn't even import stuff                    |
| 21:21      | off of an SD card. I had to use AirDrop to move video files and stuff over to my iPad.                    |
| 21:27      | I really liked working from the iPad. I have ADHD and one of the things about the Mac PC,                 |
| 21:35      | any traditional computer that's always kind of bugged me is having a ton of windows open.                 |
| 21:41      | It always pulls my attention away from what I should be focused on. With the iPad, I could                |
| 21:45      | just have one app open full screen and that's what I could be focused on. Then I could put                |
| 21:50      | something in [[Split View]] or [[Slide Over]] if need be but I could really limit myself to just                    |
| 21:55      | the thing that I needed to focus. I still struggle with focus. I don't take medication                    |
| 22:03      | for ADHD because it's always given me weird side effects like headaches and stuff like                    |
| 22:06      | that. I try and manage it myself. Using a computer that kind of works with the way my                     |
| 22:13      | brain works was super helpful. I just found the app ecosystem to be really interesting.                   |
| 22:20      | There was new stuff happening. It reminded me of not the early days of computing but                      |
| 22:26      | I got into computers when I was a kid because my dad was into computers. The era I grew                   |
| 22:31      | up in was Windows 95, 98, all that stuff. Everything was still really rough and cool                      |
| 22:37      | things were happening on computers and stuff. It just kind of reminded me of that and I                   |
| 22:42      | felt a little nostalgic for that too at the same time.                                                    |
| 22:45      | Yeah. When I wrote the iPad at Workbook, you didn't have any way to share except plugging                 |
| 22:51      | a copper cable into iTunes and then putting the file in iTunes. It was like, when you                     |
| 22:56      | think back about how they started with iPad, it's like, what were they thinking, man? I                   |
| 23:01      | don't know. But LumaFusion is an app. We're the automators so we don't get into stuff                     |
| 23:08      | like this very often. Man, if you are out there and have any interest in doing video                      |
| 23:14      | with your iPad and now that an iPad has an M1 processor and it's why not, right? LumaFusion               |
| 23:22      | is like, it's a killer app. Final Cut is, I think it's $300 now. LumaFusion is like,                      |
| 23:30      | is it $30? I think it's like one-tenth the price.                                                         |
| 23:33      | Yeah. It's $30 and I would say it's a lot more intuitive than Final Cut. I've been                        |
| 23:39      | a Final Cut Premiere Pro and Avid Editor in the past. I've used all the big three. LumaFusion             |
| 23:46      | is the most intuitive. If you have zero editing experience, it's the easiest to just get into             |
| 23:51      | and figure out how to start editing video, how to start chopping up video, colour correcting               |
| 23:57      | and things like that.                                                                                     |
| 23:59      | I've always looked at LumaFusion and been a little daunted because I don't do that kind                   |
| 24:03      | of video editing very often. But that said, whenever I've actually gone in and played                     |
| 24:07      | with it, I've also found that it's surprisingly easy to get to grips with once you actually               |
| 24:11      | have a project in there. It's just if you're poking around at it going, oh, I'm not sure                  |
| 24:15      | about this because you're actually doing anything. I think what a lot of these apps learning              |
| 24:20      | by doing is really the trick.                                                                             |
| 24:22      | Yeah. The big thing is if you have three video clips, just drop them in the timeline and                  |
| 24:27      | just start playing around. You're not going to hurt anything. It's what's called a non-destructive        |
| 24:31      | editor, which is like an old school term from back in the days of when stuff was actually                 |
| 24:36      | on film and people were cutting and gluing things. It's totally safe to play around with.                 |
| 24:44      | I think it's pretty easy to pick up when it's compared to something like Final Cut                        |
| 24:48      | and Premiere.                                                                                             |
| 24:51      | The attraction for you partly was the software, but also at some point you found your way                 |
| 24:57      | down the automation rabbit hole.                                                                          |
| 25:00      | With apps like Workflow, which is now shortcuts, and Drafts, Workflow for me was just a way               |
| 25:08      | to fill in those gaps of things the iPad couldn't do at the time. Now, where we're at right               |
| 25:17      | now with iPadOS 15, those gaps that I was using Workflow to fill in have mostly been                      |
| 25:22      | covered. I don't have to worry about moving files around and things like that because                     |
| 25:26      | there is a files app. That being said, shortcuts can do a lot of other stuff on top of that,              |
| 25:32      | but Workflow was just an interesting and easy to understand application when it came to                   |
| 25:37      | automation.                                                                                               |
| 25:39      | I think this was my first real like, okay, I fully understand this. I can build something                 |
| 25:45      | from scratch without having to go Google, like I need this snippet of code or how to                      |
| 25:50      | do step one, two, and three.                                                                              |
| 25:53      | Workflow was kind of the first way that I fully, that kind of helped me understand how                    |
| 25:59      | automation could improve my life, help speed up my workflow, which in turn I took that                    |
| 26:06      | to my day job, which at the time was IT. I picked up [[PowerShell]], which is just a whole                    |
| 26:13      | fun thing right there. I say fun sarcastically.                                                           |
| 26:17      | But through [[PowerShell]] and a few other Windows tools, I automated about 80, 85% of my last                |
| 26:25      | job, which allowed me to work on my video stuff when I shouldn't have been working on                     |
| 26:29      | my video stuff. I should have been doing my day job, but oh well. Automating that allowed                 |
| 26:35      | me to make sure my job was still being done, even though it was being done in the background,             |
| 26:40      | work on the job that I was really excited about, videos, and then last December quit                      |
| 26:44      | that job and go full-time making videos for the internet.                                                 |
| 26:49      | I think automating your day job as well, there's things where if you know what you're doing               |
| 26:53      | and you've done it right, you aren't going to have a problem unless you actually forget                   |
| 26:57      | where your day job is. There have been a couple of those stories where people have automated              |
| 27:00      | their jobs and forgot how it actually worked and just sat there taking the salary, which                  |
| 27:05      | fair enough, but knowing how your automations work is probably pretty critical. It certainly              |
| 27:09      | sounds like you figured that much out.                                                                    |
| 27:12      | It's also a challenge though. When you automate things in your day job, like I remember my                |
| 27:17      | old job, I automated so much that they didn't have to hire some support staff for me. I saved             |
| 27:25      | them a bunch of money, but they were always a little leery of me because it's like, well,                 |
| 27:30      | are you actually working?                                                                                 |
| 27:32      | Well, the nice thing for me is, it was an insurance company that I was working for,                       |
| 27:40      | so it's not a tech company or anything like that. As far as the technology stack, I was                   |
| 27:47      | at the top in the company. There really wasn't anyone to question whether or not I was actually           |
| 27:52      | doing my job or anything like that because they had no idea what I actually did. They                     |
| 27:58      | just know, hey, if the internet doesn't work, I'm the person you call.                                    |
| 28:02      | Yeah, that's the other thing. I represent a lot in my lawyer job. I represent a lot                       |
| 28:07      | of IT people, and I always have this speech I give them about the problem of being IT                     |
| 28:12      | is that you're a wizard and people don't understand your magic. If something goes wrong because           |
| 28:19      | of something you did, they may not think it was you because of magic, but if something                    |
| 28:23      | goes wrong that you didn't do, they'll still think it's you because of magic.                             |
| 28:27      | They don't understand what's going on. You're going to have random blame thrown at you occasionally.      |
| 28:35      | My first day in that job, as the senior network admin, the internet went out. Our ISP had issues,         |
| 28:43      | and I was freaking out because I was like, this is my first day. How do I just explain                    |
| 28:48      | this isn't my fault on my first day? Yeah, that was not a fun day.                                        |
| 28:53      | On the other hand, trial by fire, clearly you survived. Yeah, they did not fire me,                       |
| 28:59      | so that's nice. Yes, not firing you for something that's                                                  |
| 29:02      | not your fault is usually a good start to these things.                                                   |
| 29:05      | Yes, so you started out with workflow and shortcuts to scratch your own itch, but at                      |
| 29:11      | some point you started to teach people about this stuff. At what point did your interest                  |
| 29:16      | and shortcuts run deeper than merely as user?                                                             |
| 29:21      | When I started my YouTube channel and started talking about apps, I think the biggest request             |
| 29:26      | right away was workflow videos, videos about using workflow. I don't think those are still                |
| 29:32      | live just because they're so old now, the information didn't hold up.                                     |
| 29:37      | I put off doing it because I was like, this is such a beast to tackle. Then when I finally                |
| 29:43      | felt comfortable in the position where I was like, okay, I have my video making process                   |
| 29:48      | down, I have my research and writing process down, I feel like I can finally tackle this.                 |
| 29:53      | I made two videos, one about just making a simple workflow, and then the second one                       |
| 29:58      | I think was talking about magic variable. No, no, I'm sorry, that was later on, but                       |
| 30:03      | there was a second video, and then right after that second video is when Apple purchased                  |
| 30:07      | workflow. It kind of took the air out of the tires                                                        |
| 30:11      | because we didn't know what was happening, but then I think they put out the magic variable               |
| 30:15      | update later on or something like, I don't remember the timeline of everything. It's                      |
| 30:19      | all kind of jumbled in my head because after this last year, who knows what time is. It                   |
| 30:27      | kind of took the air out of the tires a little bit, but when iOS 12 came out and we saw shortcuts         |
| 30:33      | kind of being integrated and Siri shortcuts became a thing where third-party apps could                   |
| 30:38      | donate actions and stuff like that, people got really into it. I don't even know. It                      |
| 30:45      | must have been about eight videos after iOS 12 came out. All of those videos, people were                 |
| 30:50      | super excited for that. Ever since then, I just like talking about shortcuts. I don't                     |
| 30:56      | make a lot of dedicated videos for shortcuts, but what I try and do is anytime I talk about               |
| 31:01      | an app or service, I try and roll a shortcut or two or four into it. That way I can kind                  |
| 31:07      | of just make sure people know about it and make sure people are aware of it and also                      |
| 31:13      | give people shortcuts. If people don't want to build shortcuts, like if they find it too                  |
| 31:17      | intimidating, I will always try and link to shortcuts in the descriptions of videos and                   |
| 31:21      | stuff like that so they have something to play around with so they can kind of understand                 |
| 31:26      | what shortcuts is and why it's important for users, especially iPhone and iPad users and                  |
| 31:31      | soon to be Mac users.                                                                                     |
| 31:33      | Can you share a shortcut with us that you've recently created that you're excited about?                  |
| 31:38      | Yes. One of my absolute favourite features in iPadOS 15 is a quick note. I think it's                      |
| 31:46      | a fantastic feature basically allows you to take a note anywhere in the OS when you're                    |
| 31:51      | on an iPad. But one of the issues with it is it's limited to the Notes app. What I would                  |
| 32:02      | like to see in the future, and this is totally besides the point, is Apple open that up to                |
| 32:05      | third parties and give like a quick note API and let apps like [[Drafts]] or Bear or Craft                    |
| 32:11      | or [[Obsidian]] or whatever make their own version of quick note. That would be cool. But that's              |
| 32:16      | not there today.                                                                                          |
| 32:18      | So I made a shortcut using the new input action, get on screen content. And what this does                |
| 32:24      | is it takes the content that is on the screen and passes it into a shortcut. Now, I don't                 |
| 32:30      | know about you guys, but on the beta, I've only gotten this to work with URLs, like web                   |
| 32:36      | pages. That's it. I've never gotten this to work with anything that the quick note linking                |
| 32:40      | can work with. So that is kind of a bummer, but I've made it work. So what I did with                     |
| 32:48      | this is it gets the on screen content, it pulls the URL using regex and shows the link.                   |
| 32:54      | So if there is something on screen that's valid that get on screen content works with,                    |
| 32:59      | it'll show that link that I can choose to attach it to a new draft because this works                     |
| 33:04      | with the [[Drafts]] app. It'll attach it to the [[Drafts]] app and then ask for my note. I can                    |
| 33:10      | just type the note in and it'll create that note. It's not a perfect quick note alternative.              |
| 33:16      | I call it quick draft because it's a draft. My naming is not clever at all.                               |
| 33:23      | Clever naming is not important. Accurate naming is.                                                       |
| 33:27      | Yeah. And I think that's pretty accurate, but what's nice is when it attaches the link,                   |
| 33:32      | it uses regex to pull the link and mark down to pull the, the, the domain name of the website             |
| 33:38      | and formats it properly. Now there is a weird bug with beta eight of iPad OS 15. I need                   |
| 33:45      | to submit feedback for it today. I just noticed it this morning because beta eight literally              |
| 33:49      | just came out a little like, I think a day ago at the time of recording this, sorry to                    |
| 33:54      | date it, but it shows that link like three times when, when it shows a preview of that                    |
| 34:00      | link. For some reason it's just a bug, but when you go to attach it, it only attaches                     |
| 34:04      | it once. So I'm not entirely sure what's happening with that bug there, but it's, it's just a,            |
| 34:09      | it's a nice alternative for those that don't use the notes app. You could easily swap out                 |
| 34:14      | the [[Drafts]] action with just about any other note taking app that supports shortcuts. And                  |
| 34:21      | if you don't want to attach it in the menu option, there's a don't attach button right                    |
| 34:25      | there. So you can just type out whatever you want in the note. And, and there's a clever                  |
| 34:29      | piece in there too, that if there is nothing to attach, it just skips that part altogether.               |
| 34:34      | Like it doesn't even ask you if you want to attach, attach a link or not. It just, it                     |
| 34:40      | just gives you a plain ask for input box. So you can type your note and it'll save it                     |
| 34:45      | to Drafts.                                                                                                |
| 34:46      | So, so share an example of where in your day to day life you've used that shortcut.                       |
| 34:50      | Okay. So I'm doing a ton of research right now, just with a few apps that, you know,                      |
| 34:57      | pay web pages of apps that are being worked on right now for upcoming iOS and iPadOS 15                   |
| 35:03      | stuff.                                                                                                    |
| 35:04      | I did a lot of research in [[Obsidian]] for [[Obsidian]]. I didn't quite make that jump yet, but for              |
| 35:11      | [[Obsidian]] that I was saving links to that. But basically it's just a nice way to quickly                   |
| 35:16      | like, Hey, I have this web page. I need to save it. So let me save it to Drafts, which                     |
| 35:21      | [[Drafts]] is a markdown app. It's one of my favourite things about it and why I just, I struggle              |
| 35:27      | using the notes out because it doesn't support markdown. So this allows me to kind of take                |
| 35:32      | that web page, that link, put it in Drafts, and I could save that link anywhere, format                    |
| 35:39      | and markdown and add my notes, thoughts, whatever to it.                                                  |
| 35:43      | And another nice thing you could do with that, I haven't seen the shortcut itself, but just               |
| 35:47      | thinking it through, because [[Drafts]] has so much shortcut support, you could like have                     |
| 35:52      | it a pin to an existing draft if you wanted, like if you had your [[Obsidian]] research note                  |
| 35:57      | and you could write a custom shortcut or to a choose from menu and have it save that,                     |
| 36:03      | that captured a draft in a pre, you know, determined location.                                            |
| 36:09      | So I do that. I have two other like [[Drafts]] that are kind of branches of the, I'm sorry,                   |
| 36:15      | I have two other shortcuts that are kind of branches of this shortcut right there. One                    |
| 36:19      | that is one that appends to a [[Drafts]] document called apps to check out. And then one that                 |
| 36:24      | appends to another [[Drafts]] document called stuff to check out. And it's just, you know,                    |
| 36:28      | it's just nice. I just swapped out the new [[Drafts]] action for the append action.                           |
| 36:33      | I have a very similar shortcut I wrote that deals with my field guides. And when someone                  |
| 36:38      | writes me an email or she's something online that I think I may want to include in a future               |
| 36:43      | update, I just select the text and trigger a shortcut and then draft says which one,                      |
| 36:48      | you know, and I click, you know, this is for, you know, this is for the shortcuts field guide             |
| 36:53      | and I push the button and then it saves that text with designations into a [[Drafts]] file that               |
| 36:58      | we're using the appended end. So then I can just when it's time to go to the update, I                    |
| 37:03      | just go and I've got a list of everything I need to see. And that's like a three action                   |
| 37:07      | shortcut. I mean, it's not a big shortcut. Yeah, I mean, this shortcut right here, even                   |
| 37:11      | with the menus and stuff like that, it's only 14 actions. When you start bringing in regex                |
| 37:18      | and stuff like that, it sounds really complicated and then can look complicated, but it's not             |
| 37:24      | a hundred action shortcut. In fact, I don't think I've made that many like plus 50 action                 |
| 37:31      | shortcuts. I think most useful ones for me are kind of in that like five to 20 action                     |
| 37:37      | range when they like useful complex shortcuts.                                                            |
| 37:40      | Yeah, well, clearly Apple doesn't want you to make really long ones because the interface                 |
| 37:44      | has no capability of really doing that right.                                                             |
| 37:48      | Yeah, I mean, there is so in iOS and iPad OS 15, you can now collapse actions like menus                  |
| 37:55      | and if statements and that's nice. The actions themselves are smaller. They don't take up                 |
| 37:59      | as much space on screen. I think that more has more to do with like devices like the                      |
| 38:04      | iPhone and stuff like that. That just makes it easier to manage. But yeah, the the interface              |
| 38:11      | itself does need some love. I know it kind of got overhauled this year. But man, is it                    |
| 38:19      | really buggy? I don't know about you guys, but I'm seeing all sorts of bugs.                              |
| 38:23      | Oh, yeah. Yeah, all of them.                                                                              |
| 38:25      | Have you ever had the thing where you've got a long shortcut and you're like scrolling                    |
| 38:28      | through it to get to where you want. And you manage to let your finger linger on the screen               |
| 38:33      | just a moment too long and you and then you grab an action and move it somewhere. But                     |
| 38:40      | then the scroll continues and you're like, well, I'm screwed. I have no idea what I just                  |
| 38:44      | did.                                                                                                      |
| 38:45      | There's an undo button, which I've used for that. The problem is is whenever that happens                 |
| 38:50      | as I then also tap done to make sure that, you know, I don't have other stuff there.                      |
| 38:57      | And then yeah, it's really annoying. I found scrolling with a trackpad much more reliable.                |
| 39:03      | So magic keyboard for the wind.                                                                           |
| 39:05      | Yeah, I thought I was tweeting about this a couple of weeks ago. Basically, like just                     |
| 39:11      | I need versioning for shortcuts is what I need because I messed something up really                       |
| 39:16      | bad, hit the done button by accident and was just like, oh, no, oh, I got to rebuild this                 |
| 39:21      | real. And it was a regex thing too. And it was I deleted the match text action. And I                     |
| 39:27      | I'm not a regex expert. Like I to me, it's very much like a sludge hammer tool that I'm                   |
| 39:33      | just going to keep on swinging until I actually get the thing right. Yeah. But I yeah, there              |
| 39:40      | needs to be some kind of versioning built into shortcuts.                                                 |
| 39:43      | And the stupid thing is there is versioning built into shortcuts. If somehow you manage                   |
| 39:47      | to edit a shortcut on two different devices before one of them sinks, when you open it                    |
| 39:51      | up in the future, it'll say which one of these do you want to use? But you know, there there's            |
| 39:58      | no way to go in really and compare them that I found, you know, I can sort of look at it                  |
| 40:02      | and go, I think I edited the iPad one later and it was fine, maybe, but they both say                     |
| 40:09      | iPad. Oh, yeah, I don't think that's versioning. I think that's just a conflict. That's just              |
| 40:14      | a conflict. That's our version. But yeah, I get it.                                                       |

| 40:53      | I set up a TextExpander snippet just today for something I'm doing at work, where I                     |
| 40:58      | need to enter the precise date and time followed by a particular key string. The key string will            |
| 41:03      | change every couple of days, but that's easy enough to do and now I always type exactly                   |
| 41:07      | the same thing and everything's input perfectly. As a listener of Automators, you get 20%                 |

| 41:22      | support of this show and Relay FM. Okay, so you invoked before the break the word [[Drafts]]                |
| 41:30      | and I feel like we can't just let that go. I think next to shortcuts [[Drafts]] is probably                   |
| 41:36      | one of the most frequently talked about automation tools, especially in relation to iPad and iOS.         |
| 41:41      | So tell us your draft story. How did you get into it and what are you doing with it?                      |
| 41:46      | I came to [[Drafts]] kind of late actually. I got into it when version five was in beta                       |
| 41:52      | and I was like, okay, I get this. This makes a lot of sense to me and I ended up making a                 |
| 41:59      | whole video about it, but the idea of just being able to have something that you can quickly write        |
| 42:04      | your text down in on your phone whenever you're going and this was the heyday of my IT career.            |
| 42:12      | So I was, I'm constantly writing down port numbers or IP addresses or all sorts of different              |
| 42:19      | things and [[Drafts]] was perfect for just hitting the icon, start typing and then you can close it           |
| 42:24      | and come back to it later. [[Drafts]] was like the perfect application for that. Even still with              |
| 42:31      | quick note and stuff like that. I still think [[Drafts]] is the easiest way to take a note because            |
| 42:35      | while quick note is great on the iPad, there is no quick note on the iPhone. So I thought quick           |
| 42:43      | note was on the Mac. It's not. It kind of is because it keeps getting in the way on my Monterey           |
| 42:48      | beta machine. Interesting. Yeah. So it keeps popping up whenever I put my mouse in the bottom             |
| 42:53      | right hand corner and it won't go away and it's a draft note that I created whilst podcasting at          |
| 42:57      | some point and it's not something I want appearing when I put my mouse in that corner. So I need to       |
| 43:02      | get rid of it at some point, but it also never bothered me enough that I've actually gone and             |
| 43:07      | got rid of it. Like I probably should. But yeah, quick note on iPad. I've simulated on iPhone,            |
| 43:13      | sorry, I've simulated with the accessibility feature for double back tap and I've assigned it             |
| 43:18      | to a shortcut which creates a new blank draft and opens it in Drafts. That's clever. Yeah,                |
| 43:23      | that's a good idea. Because then I can just pick up my phone. I double tap approximately                  |
| 43:28      | where the Apple logo is. This works in a case. It runs my automation and a couple of seconds              |
| 43:32      | later I'm in [[Drafts]] and or not even a couple of seconds. It's half a second, I guess I'm in [[Drafts]]       |
| 43:39      | right now. So I just tapped it. So yeah, I love that feature. Yeah. I mean, and as much as I love         |
| 43:45      | that ugly beast that is obsidian, I really think that there's a place in my heart always for [[Drafts]]      |
| 43:52      | because exactly what Chris said, I mean, you open the app and you start typing, there is no               |
| 43:58      | friction. And I guess the thing that quick note misses, in my opinion, is the action on that text.        |
| 44:05      | I mean, quick note will capture it for you. But only [[Drafts]] can say, okay, save this to the append        |
| 44:12      | file for the update to the shortcuts field guide or text this out to my two sisters or, you know,         |
| 44:18      | just like the two things that, you know, it does. It just doesn't, you know, quick note just doesn't      |
| 44:25      | go to that next step. But anyway, I'm banging on about [[Drafts]] and we have a guest here to talk            |
| 44:31      | about Drafts. So I should shut up. Yeah, no, no, but I completely agree with you. I mean,                 |
| 44:35      | the name's quick note and it worked perfectly in the early betas. But now when you invoke it,             |
| 44:41      | it opens a previous note instead of a new note, which is how it should work, but whatever. Besides        |
| 44:45      | this point, [[Drafts]] works perfectly for this. One of my favourite things about [[Drafts]] is                    |
| 44:51      | when you're using Drafts, and you close it, and you reopen it, I think the default is 60 seconds,         |
| 44:58      | and it will keep that old draft open before just creating a new draft every time you open the app,        |
| 45:03      | which is great on the iPhone. So like, I can close it and be like, Oh, wait, I forgot something to        |
| 45:07      | reopen it back up. But on the iPad, I use that icon down at the bottom that always keeps my previous      |
| 45:13      | draft open, the last draft that I was working in, because that's it's my text editor. This is where       |
| 45:20      | I do all my note taking research, script writing, anything that you can kind of think of here,            |
| 45:27      | here and between like, all all my text writing happens in Drafts, which is nice, because I like           |
| 45:35      | having just one application where everything lives. But I use an action, I did not make this              |
| 45:41      | action because my my JavaScript skills are aren't that impressive. They are my my auto teacher used       |
| 45:48      | to say, you know enough to be dangerous. And that's how I feel about my JavaScript skills. I know         |
| 45:53      | enough to be dangerous. So I most of the time break things or don't write it correctly. So I got this     |
| 46:00      | action from the [[Drafts]] action dictionary called cross linking. And what this does is it gives             |
| 46:05      | when you hit it, it gives you a menu option for finding another draft. And then it will do the            |
| 46:13      | the colon colon name of draft colon colon. So that way you can tap on that and it'll jump                 |
| 46:20      | right to that draft. I know that's the same thing in city and in all that other fun markdown              |
| 46:25      | applications. But that cross linking feature basically allows me to link [[Drafts]] together.                 |
| 46:31      | So when I do a video, I usually will have three, four, five different [[Drafts]] documents. I'll have         |
| 46:36      | notes, research, the script, sponsorship, stuff like that. And I can link all those two together.         |
| 46:44      | Yeah. I mean, [[Drafts]] has a back linking functionality that's created through a                            |
| 46:48      | JavaScript plugin that that was done. I use the same one. I don't we should give credit to                |
| 46:55      | ever wrote it, but I don't have access to that that right now. I believe so the cross linking             |
| 47:00      | a couple of people. So Tim, the hammock was certainly trying this along with several other                |
| 47:04      | people. And then Greg Pierce adult tortoise himself created a common fruits and action,                   |
| 47:11      | or if it's an action group, I'm looking for it right now to make sure it's in the show notes              |
| 47:14      | for people. I put it in the dock. I just pulled it up. Yes, Greg was the one that made it. Of course,     |
| 47:19      | it was Greg. Yeah. So and it's a it's an action directory. So like there's a whole bunch of               |
| 47:25      | actions in there. I mostly just use the insert link to draft, which basically allows you to               |
| 47:31      | link pulls up a menu. And the reason why I do that instead of just hitting the the bracket,               |
| 47:36      | bracket, I said colon earlier, I meant bracket, the bracket, bracket name, bracket, bracket,              |
| 47:43      | I am terrible. Yeah. Yes, exactly. I am terrible at remembering the names of stuff I made, like           |
| 47:52      | I could never remember what I named documents. So what this action gives you is a menu to search          |
| 47:57      | through or just tap on a draft and link it right in there. And that's that's exactly what I need.         |
| 48:03      | I like what [[Obsidian]] does and apps like craft and stuff like that, where they have a menu,                |
| 48:07      | like you can type the at symbol or start doing the wiki leaking, wiki linking, and it'll just,            |
| 48:14      | you know, kind of start to auto fill it for you. But [[Drafts]] doesn't have that yet, hopefully,             |
| 48:19      | maybe one day. No, but it did recently add support for previews in on those links,                        |
| 48:25      | which is really great in the latest update. I love that preview feature.                                  |
| 48:29      | I mean, and [[Drafts]] really is kind of a more generic tool. And I think Greg, if he was here,               |
| 48:35      | would agree. I mean, it's written to be able to do whatever you need with text, where things like         |
| 48:41      | [[Roam]] and [[Craft]] and [[Obsidian]] even are very kind of opinionated. And there's a way right way to use         |
| 48:48      | those apps where Drafts, you can, you can bend it to your will. And I think that that's to me why         |
| 48:55      | I think that there's, you know, like I said earlier, I think [[Drafts]] is the place where I                  |
| 48:59      | capture text. And for me, [[Obsidian]] is the place with long term storage and other things that I            |
| 49:05      | do with it. And they work together fine. I mean, not to mention you were saying, I think even before      |
| 49:10      | we start recording today, how you're not completely comfortable with [[Obsidian]] as an iPad app, because     |
| 49:16      | it doesn't look like an iPad app. I mean, yeah, it doesn't, it feels like an electron app on your         |
| 49:22      | iPad. And the whereas [[Drafts]] is very much a native app experience. And Greg spends a lot of time          |
| 49:31      | making sure it is. Yeah, like one of the things I use in [[Drafts]] a lot is the multi window feature         |
| 49:38      | on the iPad. So I will have multiple draft documents open on my iPad. And I'll have them in               |
| 49:43      | [[Split View]], or I can just jump around using the new shell feature and iPad OS 15 or whatever.             |
| 49:49      | And [[Obsidian]], what kind of the kind of thing that just killed me right there is it does not have          |
| 49:54      | support for multi window at all, like you just have the one window. So I can get over the electron        |
| 50:00      | app that doesn't bother me as much. But like when it comes to those like core features of how a           |
| 50:06      | device works, I find those to be really important, like stuff like multi window drag and drop,            |
| 50:13      | split screen or [[Split View]] and all that kind of support. I honestly think if I were like,                 |
| 50:18      | like Chris Lawley, if I was a guy who primarily used an iPad, I probably would not be an [[Obsidian]]          |
| 50:24      | user, I'd probably be a craft user. That would be the app that I use for that's that type of stuff,       |
| 50:29      | because Craft is so much better on the iPad than [[Obsidian]] is. But you know, the nice thing                |
| 50:35      | with [[Obsidian]] is it's like, it's the ultimate customisability, you can write plugins and                  |
| 50:42      | do things with it. But but if you just if you're happy with the built in craft feature set,               |
| 50:46      | you're saving yourself a lot of pain and suffering. Yeah. So I have to say, Chris, you said you know      |
| 50:52      | enough to be dangerous as a [[JavaScript]] developer. That's all JavaScript developers know. I write          |
| 50:56      | JavaScript. JavaScript is 50% of my day job. And it's I know enough to be dangerous and break             |
| 51:02      | the things I need to break in order to find what I need to fix to fix the problem. There are many         |
| 51:07      | people out there better JavaScript developers than me. But unless it's literally, you know,               |
| 51:11      | your primary development focus, it's one of those languages that especially with the variations of        |
| 51:17      | [[Angular]], [[AngularJS]], [[React]], all of the different options, there's so much going on that it's               |
| 51:23      | impossible to know everything. Yeah. And that describes 99% of people who write [[AppleScript]],             |
| 51:29      | honestly. You know, you got like salsa going in and a couple other folks who like really know             |
| 51:34      | what they're doing in AppleScript and the rest of us that start with Google. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,         |
| 51:40      | that's how I primarily learned [[PowerShell]] in my IT days is I just Googled everything. And then I          |
| 51:47      | read a book and I cannot remember. Oh, it was learn [[PowerShell]] in 30 days of lunches or something         |
| 51:54      | like that. I think it's something something in a month of lunches. I've just found it on Google           |
| 52:00      | also complete for the win. Yes. That is a solid book. If you have an IT job and you want to learn         |
| 52:06      | [[PowerShell]] to automate most of that IT job, so you don't actually have to do that IT job,                 |
| 52:11      | that is a solid solid book right there. Yeah. The other book I'd recommend for people who are             |
| 52:16      | looking at that and going, oh, [[PowerShell]], I don't I don't use Windows is automate the boring stuff       |
| 52:21      | with Python. Yeah. That's a good option too. I wrote an AppleScript recently to                          |
| 52:28      | either go to and select a specific mailbox in [[Apple Mail]] or move a message to a specific mailbox.         |
| 52:35      | And I covered this in the webinar I did last week as a show publishes. But the                            |
| 52:41      | I got it working for every mailbox except the inbox. And I spent like an hour googling it. I              |
| 52:49      | was about to write Sal because I was just about to give up. And I thought, well, let me try this.         |
| 52:53      | And I just made the word inbox all caps. And it started working and buried in the Apple Mail              |
| 52:59      | dictionary somewhere for AppleScript is a requirement that if you're going to designate                  |
| 53:03      | the inbox, it'd be in all caps. And I'm like, sure, why not? You know, it's like somebody                 |
| 53:09      | at some point felt that was a good idea. Yeah. Oh my gosh, that and that's probably sensitivity.          |
| 53:14      | It's the bane and the savior of many an automation. And that's probably been there for 20 plus years      |
| 53:20      | too. Exactly. Exactly. Since probably the first OS 10 shift, like, yeah, oh my gosh. Yeah, that's         |
| 53:28      | nuts. Yeah. Well, anyway, so so share some more of your the stuff you're doing with Drafts.               |
| 53:36      | Okay, let me pull up here just. Oh, so one of the things that I do is I have an icon in my dock.          |
| 53:43      | And a lot of people have been asking me about this when they see it in videos and stuff like that.        |
| 53:48      | It's just a rocket ship. And that goes to a launchpad document. And this is basically a                   |
| 53:53      | document with everything that I'm working on. So all the video projects I'm doing, all the stuff          |
| 53:58      | that I'm kind of working on for upcoming projects, sponsorships, any business related things that         |
| 54:05      | are there, all of that is linked in one draft. So I was talking earlier about how I put things            |
| 54:11      | and [[Drafts]] in [[Split View]] together. In the morning, I basically start my day with things and this          |
| 54:17      | [[Drafts]] document and [[Split View]]. And I basically kind of just worked down the list of the two apps         |
| 54:21      | and was like, Okay, here's everything that I got going on. Make sure all the tasks that are in            |
| 54:26      | things are up to date. Make sure all the stuff that's linked properly and [[Drafts]] is linked together.      |
| 54:32      | It is a very manual process that I have to do to kind of get all those linking links to work              |
| 54:37      | correctly. Because as I finish a project, I have to go in and delete it. It would be cool if I could      |
| 54:42      | somehow get things and [[Drafts]] to work together. If I mark this project as complete, archive these         |
| 54:49      | [[Drafts]] or whatever, that would be cool. But that's not there. But yeah, so having these                   |
| 54:57      | kinds of documents together just kind of helps organise my brain a little bit. If I don't write           |
| 55:02      | something down, I will completely forget about it. I will not remember. My brain just forgets             |
| 55:10      | things. Like right there, I totally lost where I was going with that sentence. And yeah, I just           |
| 55:16      | completely lost it. But yeah, linking things in [[Drafts]] is just a nice way of staying organised,           |
| 55:21      | especially if you're using [[Drafts]] as a note taking application or a text editor or whatever kind of       |
| 55:30      | document, just linking things together. Like right now, I have a bunch of documents, right, or a          |
| 55:36      | bunch of like little snippets of text saved because I got rear-ended a couple of nights ago. That wasn't  |
| 55:41      | fun. So when you get in the car accident, you get a whole bunch of information from a bunch of            |
| 55:46      | different insurance companies. And I don't want to lose that. So I have a master [[Drafts]] document          |
| 55:51      | that links to all of these other text documents. So whenever I have a phone call with these               |
| 55:55      | insurance people, I can go to that master document and quickly jump to wherever that                      |
| 55:59      | text is. And it's just a nice feature of that linking. Another thing that I do with [[Drafts]]               |
| 56:06      | that I absolutely love is I use, I build a lot of templates in Drafts. I'm sure this is, I know           |
| 56:12      | this is something you guys have talked about, but like I can't stress enough. Like there is an action     |
| 56:17      | when you go to set up a [[Drafts]] action called insert text. And that is a very powerful tool.               |
| 56:24      | I have all like my video descriptions, emails to potential sponsorships, all sorts of like                |
| 56:31      | business related things in this templates category. And just with one button, I could tap it,             |
| 56:36      | fill in the, you know, the information that, you know, it can't be pulled from variables or               |
| 56:41      | whatever, fill that in, copy it or use another [[Drafts]] action and send it as an email or something         |
| 56:46      | like that. It's just such a nice feature in the app that I'm kind of surprised more text editors          |
| 56:52      | don't take advantage of having templates. I know that's a big thing in [[Obsidian]] right now is like         |
| 56:57      | the community is using a bunch of plugins to build templates. Yeah, well, but honestly,                   |
| 57:03      | the template builder and obsidian, man, I'm going to get the [[Obsidian]] people mad at me,                   |
| 57:07      | but I don't think it's as good as Drafts. Really? Yeah, the template, I mean, there are some good         |
| 57:13      | stuff. Anyway, I'm already in triple cells. So what I do here, because I already had all                  |
| 57:19      | of my templates and everything set up in Drafts, because I don't just use the insert text,                |
| 57:23      | [[Drafts]] actually has a template engine itself, which you can, you can do a bunch of things with.           |
| 57:30      | Of course, you can't just use the insert text. And, but there's also the ability to grab things           |
| 57:34      | from certain folders and finder and so on, you know, inside the drops, iCloud folder. And I do            |
| 57:40      | that to create a bunch of templates. So I do that and I pass it off to [[Obsidian]] afterwards, because       |
| 57:46      | I already had the automation, it works the way I want it to, it works the way it's always worked,         |
| 57:51      | I don't have to change my workflow. And we all know workflow switching costs are big,                     |
| 57:55      | because it's not just how much time does it cost you, it's also how much brain does it cost you.          |
| 58:00      | And Chris, you're not the only one that gets lost, miss said mid sentence, I do that too.                 |
| 58:05      | So, you know, it's really useful to be able to just take that and just go, okay, so I've created          |
| 58:10      | this, and now I'm going to dump it in obsidian, because that works for me. And you just kind of           |
| 58:14      | do what makes sense, like for instance, in obsidian, I have a template for a new client project,          |
| 58:20      | you know, when a legal client asked me to do a thing for them, there's a new markdown document            |
| 58:25      | created, and it's got all the like stuff in there, it's got the [[YAML]] matter, it's got the links for       |
| 58:30      | the OmniFocus project, it does all that for me. But when someone calls me, and I want to take             |
| 58:36      | notes on that call, I have a [[Drafts]] template, and I open Drafts, and I push a button, and it fills        |
| 58:42      | in the date and the time and a whole bunch of other stuff, and I type in who I'm talking to,              |
| 58:46      | and I can take notes, and I find it easier to do something like that out of [[Drafts]] than [[Obsidian]].         |
| 58:51      | And so you just kind of like, once you kind of get an understanding of these templated text               |
| 58:55      | tools, they're all about the same really, they aren't that different. You can use that automation         |
| 59:00      | to make your life easier. Yeah, absolutely. [[Drafts]] also recently got updated to make custom               |
| 59:07      | theming too. And not recently, it was a while ago, but I recently finally got around to                   |
| 59:14      | making my own theme. It's on the [[Drafts]] theme directory, it's just called Dark Knight.                    |
| 59:20      | But like, I am so happy with like the way this looks, and like the customisation that you can             |
| 59:27      | really do with this kind of thing, or with this kind of app is just, it's, I'm kind of surprised          |
| 59:35      | more apps don't do, not to the level that [[Drafts]] did it, but like just like customising applications      |
| 59:40      | the way you do this. I know a lot of designers are very opinionated, and they're like, hey,               |
| 59:46      | you know, like, this is my design, I don't want people to touch it. But like, being able to make          |
| 59:50      | them app feel like my own, and like, I have the right font, and I have like a nice blue tint to           |
| 59:55      | everything that looks really nice, and kind of, you know, it just matches my aesthetic, if you will.      |
| 01:00:01   | It's, I don't know, everyone, I highly doubt you have any listeners that haven't checked out Drafts,      |
| 01:00:07   | but if you haven't, like, it's such a good application. It's, yeah, I can't stress it                     |
| 01:00:12   | enough. I like to talk about it on my channel whenever I can. I've done like a few like,                  |
| 01:00:16   | deep dive videos into it, and I'm going to work on another one probably in October or November.           |
| 01:00:20   | Yeah, and just on that point of customisation, I think honestly, it's time for that. It's time for        |
| 01:00:27   | app developers to hand over the keys to the users, and let them do things. I mean, the                    |
| 01:00:33   | stuff that's going on with care at weather and Drafts, custom UI, and some of these apps are              |
| 01:00:38   | already kind of leading the way. But I honestly think that's the next big thing that needs to             |
| 01:00:42   | happen with apps on iPad and iPhone is let users customise. Look how everybody went crazy,                |
| 01:00:49   | you know, when they were able to try and customise their icons on their devices. And,                     |
| 01:00:54   | you know, people want this. And I feel like if you're trying to sell an app and make money selling        |
| 01:00:59   | an app, giving people what they want is a pretty good idea. Yeah, definitely.                             |

| 01:01:17   | So a few years ago, I decided to buy myself an Indiana Jones bag. You know that bag you                   |
| 01:01:22   | carry in all those movies. I found a website online that sold them, but the website was out               |
| 01:01:27   | of the country and seemed really sketchy. And as I started putting my credit card information into        |
| 01:01:33   | the system, I realised, I'm not sure I want to do this. I'm not sure where my credit card is going.       |
| 01:01:40   | And as a result, I did not buy the bag. So I was scared off of the purchase I wanted to make,             |
| 01:01:45   | just because I was afraid of the internet. And I think everybody probably has a similar story.            |
| 01:01:50   | Privacy is a tool that makes it easy to manage your financial lives online while keeping your most        |
| 01:01:55   | important information secure by generating virtual numbers. Privacy masks your bank information.          |
| 01:02:02   | So you never have to worry about giving it out to people you don't know online.                           |
| 01:02:06   | I could have bought that bag if I had privacy account a few years ago.                                    |
| 01:02:11   | Look, I don't want to give my credit card information to just anybody over the internet.                  |
| 01:02:15   | I just don't trust them. That's why a service like privacy is so important. It gives you that             |
| 01:02:22   | anonymity and that protection of your financial accounts while letting you still conduct business         |
| 01:02:28   | over the internet. As I looked into the sponsor for the show, I realised this is something I need         |
| 01:02:33   | and I signed up myself. So take back control of your payments, decide who can charge your card,           |
| 01:02:39   | how much and how often, and you can close cards at any time. Plus you can make sure that you are          |
| 01:02:44   | never accidentally billed twice or upgraded to another service without your consent.                      |
| 01:02:49   | And privacy is partnered with the folks at 1Password. You can create, use, and save                     |
| 01:02:55   | privacy cards directly within your 1Password dashboard. Indeed, I'm doing that myself.                  |
| 01:03:00   | All virtual cards created in 1Password have the same security benefits as your other privacy            |
| 01:03:06   | cards. And you can set spend limits, create single use or merchant locked cards wherever you want.        |

| 01:03:29   | all of Relay FM. Chris Lawley, I know your secret. I know your deep dark secret, Chris,                   |
| 01:03:36   | that you are the guy who makes videos about the iPad, but you have a Mac mini running                     |
| 01:03:42   | [[Hazel]] in the background. So now we can just talk about the Mac for a little while.                        |
| 01:03:46   | Okay. How did the Mac enter the equation for you?                                                         |
| 01:03:50   | So last November, I think it was November, whenever the M1 Macs were introduced,                          |
| 01:03:56   | everyone was going nuts for them. And I was like, huh, that's interesting. And I was already              |
| 01:04:01   | planning my exit from my day job. And I was like, you know, I probably should have something other        |
| 01:04:06   | than an iPad laying around because my other computer, I had computers, but they were work                 |
| 01:04:12   | computers that belonged to the company. So I was like, I'm not going to be able to take these with        |
| 01:04:16   | me, obviously. So I was like, you know, I should probably have something other than that. So I            |
| 01:04:20   | ended up ordering an M1 Mac mini 16 gigs of RAM, one terabyte of storage. And my idea for this            |
| 01:04:27   | was it was going to be my file and automation server. I don't use it for editing video. I don't           |
| 01:04:32   | use it for editing photos. Any of my, I don't write scripts on it or anything like that. It               |
| 01:04:37   | primarily runs headless. And I use Jump Desktop to control it from my iPad. But it's been an              |
| 01:04:45   | interesting utility that I don't feel like I've fully taken advantage of yet. I do have [[Hazel]]             |
| 01:04:52   | running on it. I'm using that for a few different things. I have it watching some folders in iCloud       |
| 01:04:58   | Drive. One, for instance, is a folder I use for basically shortcuts versioning that we were talking       |
| 01:05:05   | about earlier. [[Matthew Cassinelli]] and I, when I was complaining about not having versioning,               |
| 01:05:10   | we came up with a shortcut to do versioning. So I set it up as an automation on my iPad. So it            |
| 01:05:16   | automatically exports those shortcuts, then it gets put in a folder in iCloud Drive. I don't              |
| 01:05:21   | really want it to sit there. So I have [[Hazel]] watch that folder. When it gets there, it puts it locally    |
| 01:05:25   | on that Mac mini. So it kind of just pulls it out of iCloud Drive and it just stores it separately.       |
| 01:05:30   | Yeah. I mean, I feel like [[Hazel]] is like a great pairing for an iPad lifestyle. Like if you have           |
| 01:05:36   | a Mac available to you, because it really does kind of excel at the thing that the iPad is bad at.        |
| 01:05:43   | In my experience of, you know, managing multiple files and moving things around, it just, the iPad        |
| 01:05:49   | is not good at that. And if you've got a Mac sitting around that can just run a set of [[Hazel]]              |
| 01:05:54   | rules and point it at your iCloud Drive, that like solves so many problems for someone who wants to use   |
| 01:06:00   | an iPad. Yep. One of the issues that I've always had is backing up footage that I've shot. So B-roll      |
| 01:06:07   | footage of products that were sent to me and I got to send back. So I don't get to keep them. But         |
| 01:06:12   | like, hey, I want to make sure I can, you know, keep B-roll footage of this stuff around. So if           |
| 01:06:18   | I ever need to reference it in a future, so I can call back to it from a drive, obviously,                |
| 01:06:24   | it's not something that, that, that ends up being hundreds and hundreds of gigs. It's not                 |
| 01:06:28   | something I want to leave on my iPad. So I have a folder that I can dump all that stuff into an           |
| 01:06:33   | iCloud Drive. [[Hazel]] will see it and then move it automatically in the background. I don't have to         |
| 01:06:39   | deal with it at all. Move it automatically to an archive folder and on an external drive. And it          |
| 01:06:44   | works seamlessly. I've never had an issue with it. So [[Hazel]] is like a great utility, but there's          |
| 01:06:50   | some other stuff coming and I don't think it's been publicly announced. So I don't know if I can          |
| 01:06:55   | say what it is, but like, there's stuff coming that's going to pair with shortcuts on the Mac that's      |
| 01:07:01   | going to make having a Mac mini like a server sitting around running macOS so nice for people             |
| 01:07:07   | that primarily work from an iPad. And you could probably figure out what it is, but I don't think         |
| 01:07:12   | it's been announced. So I don't want to say it. You are such a tease. You are such a tease, Chris.        |
| 01:07:17   | I think if people look in our forums, they might find what you're talking about.                          |
| 01:07:21   | Yeah. I, I, I had to go and ask if it was being made and I got the yes, but not the public yes.           |
| 01:07:29   | So I don't, I don't, you know, people can figure it out and it may already be out by the time.            |
| 01:07:34   | I think what we can say is that you know how it's awesome that there's these like                         |
| 01:07:37   | shortcuts support apps on the iPhone and iPad, these apps that do things that, you know,                  |
| 01:07:44   | that shortcuts doesn't do, they kind of enhance shortcuts feature set. Those apps are coming              |
| 01:07:49   | for the Mac and that's going to be great. Yeah. And multiples of them are. I have been talking            |
| 01:07:55   | to a lot of filmmakers recently. It's very exciting. Yes. And there's one in particular that              |
| 01:08:01   | running a headless Mac mini is going to be perfect for. So I, I'm really excited for that.                |
| 01:08:06   | And I'm really excited to kind of dive into what that is going to mean for me. Like one of the            |
| 01:08:13   | things I was talking to [[Matthew Cassinelli ]]about a couple of days ago is the idea that my iPad is         |
| 01:08:19   | the client, the Mac mini is the server. So the Mac mini should be doing things in the background          |
| 01:08:25   | while my iPad is the device I'm interacting with. Sure. And, and I want that Mac mini,                    |
| 01:08:31   | even though I'm, you know, I'm somebody that works from an iPad. I, this is, this is what I do. I         |
| 01:08:37   | still want that server to be around. I'm a former network admin. I like the idea of having computers      |
| 01:08:42   | running and doing tasks for me that I don't need to spend my time in the middle of the day doing.         |
| 01:08:49   | And like a Mac mini is in the background running your, your backups while you're on your iPad             |
| 01:08:56   | editing your video. Yep. Yeah. That's one of the things I've complained about. This is another            |
| 01:09:02   | thing I've complained about is the iPad does not have a good backup solution at all. The only             |
| 01:09:08   | backup solution is iCloud and that just backs up an image. So if you lose your iPad gets, or not          |
| 01:09:15   | lose your iPad, I mean, if your iPad, you know, you delete something that you shouldn't have,             |
| 01:09:21   | you now have to restore that image of the iPad, which just brings a whole                                 |
| 01:09:25   | other headache because maybe it didn't back up because it only backs up when it's plugged into            |
| 01:09:29   | power and turned off and, and like not being used. It doesn't back up. Like right now it's                |
| 01:09:35   | sitting right next to me and it's not going to back up right now because it's being used.                 |
| 01:09:40   | So using that Mac mini and [[Hazel]] together, building that kind of pseudo backup system                     |
| 01:09:48   | really kind of really helps my, my, my brain not go into overload freaking out thinking,                  |
| 01:09:54   | oh my gosh, at any point I could lose all the video projects that I'm working on. I, I, I'm               |
| 01:09:59   | working on one of the biggest ones I've ever made right now. My iPad OS 15 walkthrough. It's,             |
| 01:10:03   | it's almost an hour long and there is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of gigs of files that            |
| 01:10:10   | I'm like, it, you know, if something were to happen that iPad, that would be terrible, but                |
| 01:10:14   | I know it's backed up. Yeah. That's, that's the whole thing you needed to be backed up.                   |
| 01:10:19   | And I find it annoying. All these people are like, well, I am on, you know,                               |
| 01:10:22   | team iPad or I'm on team Mac. I honestly think that if you, you know, as Ferris Bueller said,             |
| 01:10:28   | if you have the means, if you can have an iPad and a Mac, you're going to find uses for both              |
| 01:10:33   | of them and don't get hung up on it. You use whatever's, whatever tools best for the job                  |
| 01:10:39   | and just get on with life. And like in Matt's case, I'm sorry.                                            |
| 01:10:44   | In Chris's case. In Chris's case.                                                                         |
| 01:10:47   | Now you're talking about [[Matthew Cassinelli\|Matt Cassinelli]] so much. He's on my mind now. So in Chris's case,                |
| 01:10:51   | he's using the, you know, he's using the iPad most for his production work,                               |
| 01:10:55   | like making videos and things, but that, that's okay. You know, and if you're a final cut person,         |
| 01:11:00   | say, I need to do that on my Mac, that's okay. You shouldn't begrudge Chris wanting to do it              |
| 01:11:05   | on his iPad. And Chris doesn't begrudge you doing it on your Mac. Just everybody take a chill pill.       |
| 01:11:11   | I'm a firm believer and you should use the compute. If you're a nerd, you should use the                  |
| 01:11:15   | computer that makes you happy because there's, if you're a nerd, there's probably a computer              |
| 01:11:19   | that makes you happy to use. And for me, that's the iPad. I've said this line in my videos a lot          |
| 01:11:26   | just to kind of prove a point. I've, I've built PCs in the past. I've been a network admin. I've          |
| 01:11:31   | used Macs, but the iPad is just my favourite computer. And like, there's not really just like              |
| 01:11:36   | one thing that I can point to that says like, Oh, this is the reason why I just,                          |
| 01:11:41   | I just get joy out of using it. And, you know, at the end of the day, like, that's fine. I,               |
| 01:11:46   | I still see people get upset when, you know, people are like, Oh, you use an Android phone.               |
| 01:11:50   | And I'm like, why are we still having these arguments? Yeah, like just use the computer you               |
| 01:11:54   | like. Yeah, I still think the of all the computers I've ever owned and no computer has sparked more       |
| 01:12:01   | delight in me than an iPad. It's just, you know, having grown up watching 2001 and Star Trek and          |
| 01:12:08   | all that and suddenly sitting on the couch with this amazingly powerful computer that's a slab            |
| 01:12:14   | of glass. How can you not as a nerd get excited about that? I, I've, I've chilled on the iPad             |
| 01:12:21   | a little bit. I'm not trying to do as much with it as I used to, but I still love picking it up and       |
| 01:12:27   | using it. I mean, right next to me, I have an iPad with the same chip as the high, the, the fast          |
| 01:12:35   | Mac right now, the one Mac. Yeah. Yeah. With 16 gigs of RAM and two terabytes of storage. I mean,         |
| 01:12:40   | my iPad technically has more, well, not technically, it does have more internal storage than my Mac mini. |
| 01:12:46   | I mean, my Mac mini has a bunch of external drives plugged into it, but like the fact that                |
| 01:12:52   | those are essentially the same computer, but you just interface with them differently is just so          |
| 01:12:57   | cool to me. Like I could geek out on this stuff all day long. Yeah. So which iPad are you using?          |
| 01:13:03   | I guess we should have asked you that at the beginning. I am using a 2021 two terabyte 12.9 inch          |
| 01:13:11   | iPad pro. I'm a firm believer that if you're somebody that wants to work from the iPad fully,             |
| 01:13:16   | the 12.9 inch iPad pro is the way to go. Just because like you get that extra screen real                 |
| 01:13:21   | estate, it's better for multitasking. If you want the iPad to kind of compliment your workflow,           |
| 01:13:26   | that's kind of when the 11 inch might make a little more sense. But I think if you're somebody            |
| 01:13:31   | that wants to go all in on the iPad, the 12.9 is totally worth it. Yeah. I mean, if you're going          |
| 01:13:35   | to be editing video, that extra glass is going to help. Yeah. The LumaFusion is a bit cramped on         |
| 01:13:42   | anything smaller than the 12.9 inch iPad pro. I am in the camp of bring me the 15 inch iPad pro next.     |
| 01:13:50   | Like that's what I want. I'm ready for that. I've even talked in the past about like,                     |
| 01:13:57   | how cool would it be to have like an iPad that's the Microsoft studio style thing where it's a            |
| 01:14:03   | desktop computer plugged into power. You can tilt it, move it around, use the Apple pencil on it          |
| 01:14:09   | and stuff like that. That would be pretty cool. Obviously, that's far off like if that were to            |
| 01:14:14   | ever happen. But I would be there for that. If I got Tim Koch's job today, I would say guys,              |
| 01:14:22   | I want you to take a Microsoft studio type tilting iMac. And when it's standing up, I want it to be       |
| 01:14:29   | running Mac OS. And when it tilts down, I want it to be a 27 inch iPad. That'd be pretty cool.            |
| 01:14:34   | You guys, it's got the same silicon in it. There's really, this is something that they could do if        |
| 01:14:39   | they wanted. And that would be my dream Mac. I mean, just think about that. You know, the ability         |
| 01:14:45   | to sit up there and have AppleScript running everything, then tilt it down and opening your              |
| 01:14:49   | favourite drawing app or whatever. I mean, that would be amazing. But unfortunately,                       |
| 01:14:56   | I don't have Tim Koch's job. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Be a little optimistic there. Come on.            |
| 01:15:03   | They would literally, I have, they'd say, you got to go to this meeting and I'd be like, ah,              |
| 01:15:08   | never mind. I'll stay home. I totally feel like. I am unhirable at this point.                            |
| 01:15:15   | I kind of feel the same way too. I mean, I've been self employed for nine months now. And it's like,      |
| 01:15:23   | I don't think I could go back. I don't think I could do meetings that don't have points to                |
| 01:15:31   | it anymore or like email threads that are just like, what are you guys trying to even say here?           |
| 01:15:39   | Yeah. Never attend a meeting without a formal agenda people.                                              |
| 01:15:43   | You just triggered something that I wanted to ask you earlier. You're using iPad. What is your mail       |
| 01:15:49   | system with your iPad? Oh, so I, this is a source of contention with me. I've never found an email        |
| 01:15:57   | app that I am happy with. No, you're like everybody else. Nobody is happy. Yeah. Nobody, there is no,     |
| 01:16:04   | and I have a theory on why that is, but that's besides the point. But there's stuff I like                |
| 01:16:09   | from all of them. But the best combination that I found is using Apple Mail with SaneBox. SaneBox,        |
| 01:16:17   | that basically having server side filtering is just really nice. Why there's not filtering                |
| 01:16:24   | in Apple's mail apps, I don't understand are on the iPad and iPhone at least. Why there's                 |
| 01:16:30   | not filtering there. It doesn't make any sense. Like even just some sort of smart folder,                 |
| 01:16:35   | but with SaneBox, I have public email addresses that are in the description of my YouTube videos.         |
| 01:16:41   | There's business contacts and stuff like that. People like to sign me up for newsletters that             |
| 01:16:46   | I don't want to be on. And we all know the unsubscribe button doesn't work. So just the                   |
| 01:16:51   | ability to drag it to the same black hole folder is really nice. And to be able to organise things        |
| 01:16:56   | and then like Sane news or Sane later is really handy. Yeah, I have a suggestion for you. Now that        |
| 01:17:02   | you have that Mac mini, turn on Apple Mail and the Mac mini and use the Apple Mail rules in               |
| 01:17:09   | Apple Mail rather than rely because Apple has lousy cloud support for Apple Mail rules. But               |
| 01:17:15   | the Apple Mail app on the Mac has a very powerful rule set. And if you've got that Mac mini running,      |
| 01:17:21   | why not have Apple Mail in the background, set up your own custom rules and then that stuff will          |
| 01:17:26   | just show up on your iPad because the accounts are synced. Yes, I tried that, but I think there was       |
| 01:17:34   | like an issue when I tried that with a beta. Oh no, it was my email account. Never mind. I need           |
| 01:17:39   | to try that again. You're 100% correct. That is a good idea. Yeah, I mean, the Apple Mail rules are       |
| 01:17:46   | for automators. I mean, the Apple Mail rules that I'm not aware of any native app that has                |
| 01:17:51   | more powerful rules. I think Google Mail or Gmail has better cloud-based rules. Yeah, so Gmail has        |
| 01:17:57   | really great cloud rules better than iCloud's cloud rules. But the beauty of the of mail's                |
| 01:18:03   | rules is you can have it run on stuff that you've read. So at night, I actually have keyboard             |
| 01:18:09   | mice to activate mail, select everything and apply rules because I have rules that apply                  |
| 01:18:15   | to mails that I've read. And I don't want it to apply to things that I haven't read,                      |
| 01:18:20   | but things that I've read. But good enough, you know, you've read it. You had your challenge.             |
| 01:18:24   | I mean, we'll eat this for you now because it just deals with it. Yeah.                                   |
| 01:18:29   | Well, anyway, Chris Lawley, thanks so much for coming on the show today and sharing some of your           |

| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to Automator's podcast, where we take our technology and make it bend it to                    |
| 00:07      | our will.                                                                                              |
| 00:08      | I am David Sparks, and I'm joined by Rosemary Orchard.                                                 |
| 00:10      | Hi, Rosemary.                                                                                          |
| 00:11      | Hey, David.                                                                                            |
| 00:12      | How are you today?                                                                                     |
| 00:13      | Good.                                                                                                  |
| 00:14      | We've got a guest on the show today, Rodrigo, and Rodrigo.                                             |
| 00:17      | I forgot to ask you how to pronounce your name before the show, so I'm going to take                   |
| 00:20      | a shot.                                                                                                |
| 00:21      | Rodrigo Araujo.                                                                                         |
| 00:22      | Hi, guys.                                                                                              |
| 00:23      | Thanks for having me.                                                                                  |
| 00:25      | That's actually a common mispronunciation, because you guys pronounce it like if it were               |
| 00:31      | Spanish.                                                                                               |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:33      | In Spanish, that's probably right, but in Portuguese, it's Rodrigo Aurajo.                              |
| 00:39      | Ah, see, Southern California, man.                                                                     |
| 00:42      | No problem.                                                                                            |
| 00:43      | I thought that I had the chops, but I didn't.                                                          |
| 00:46      | There's no problem.                                                                                    |
| 00:48      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 00:49      | So, it sounds like you hit the G harder.                                                               |
| 00:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 00:53      | So, it's actually R. R. is not so round like the real Rodrigo.                                         |
| 01:00      | It's a whole Rodrigo.                                                                                  |
| 01:01      | It's like a...                                                                                         |
| 01:02      | So, it's like there's a H in there, almost.                                                            |
| 01:05      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:06      | It seems like the English H, yes, for heart.                                                           |
| 01:10      | So that includes the Speak Portuguese section of automators this week.                                 |
| 01:15      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:16      | And I am going to do my best to say your name properly.                                                |
| 01:19      | You give it to me one more time.                                                                       |
| 01:21      | Rodrigo, how do you say it again?                                                                      |
| 01:23      | Rodrigo.                                                                                               |
| 01:24      | Rodrigo.                                                                                               |
| 01:25      | Rodrigo.                                                                                               |
| 01:26      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27      | I'm going to get this guys.                                                                            |
| 01:28      | But Rodrigo, the reason he's here is because he's an amazing developer and he's the developer          |
| 01:33      | of the app [[Charty]] that we keep seeming to talk about here on the automators podcast.                  |
| 01:39      | Rodrigo made this awesome app that adds features to shortcuts and we thought it'd be fun to            |
| 01:44      | talk to him today.                                                                                     |
| 01:45      | So, welcome to the show.                                                                               |
| 01:46      | Hi, everyone.                                                                                          |
| 01:47      | Thanks for having me.                                                                                  |
| 01:48      | It's an honour to be here.                                                                              |
| 01:50      | I've been listening to automators ever since you guys started and it's baffling to be part             |
| 01:58      | of it now.                                                                                             |
| 01:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 02:00      | Well, and thank you for helping making automation better for us and I appreciate you coming on.        |
| 02:06      | Tell us Rodrigo a little bit about, obviously, you just didn't decide you want to make an              |
| 02:11      | app and start programming.                                                                             |
| 02:13      | You've got a little experience.                                                                        |
| 02:15      | Tell us a little bit about your background.                                                            |
| 02:17      | I'm actually a computer engineer from Brazil.                                                          |
| 02:21      | I live in Rio de Janeiro nowadays and I work in the oil company.                                       |
| 02:26      | I work at Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company.                                                        |
| 02:29      | So I've finished computer engineering in 2008 and ever since the app store, the iPhone                 |
| 02:37      | launched and the app store was launched the one year after.                                            |
| 02:41      | I've been meaning to make an iOS app.                                                                  |
| 02:44      | I even started making some of them.                                                                    |
| 02:48      | One of my brothers was a TV series tracker.                                                            |
| 02:55      | But we never shipped it and last year I shipped to my first app.                                       |
| 03:00      | It's chat stats.                                                                                       |
| 03:02      | It's an app to analyse WhatsApp groups, history files and generate fun statistics to move the          |
| 03:11      | groups and make everyone laugh about who sends the most messages, what time of day the groups          |
| 03:17      | are more active.                                                                                       |
| 03:20      | Yes, some of my friends like to talk a lot at night and others at noon.                                |
| 03:27      | So we get to see that and analyse everyone.                                                            |
| 03:31      | And then data analysis in an app just kind of led to probably what became Charty, right?              |
| 03:37      | Yeah, sort of.                                                                                         |
| 03:39      | I've always loved data visualisation and starting data about myself.                                   |
| 03:43      | So I've used Apple health and everything to start data about me and stuff I do.                        |
| 03:50      | So there was one year I guess it was 2009 that I've started every, the data I've watched               |
| 03:58      | each TV series for a year and in the end I made an infographic.                                        |
| 04:04      | So it's something about me that I'd like to visualise stuff.                                           |
| 04:08      | And I've been longing for a way to do this in iOS for ages and less, I guess it was November           |
| 04:15      | when I saw what [[Alex Hay]] was building with [[Toolbox Pro]].                                                |
| 04:20      | I got excited and I saw it was possible because even though I watched the WWDC keynote I hadn't        |
| 04:29      | realised the power that was being given to developers in iOS 13.                                       |
| 04:34      | So when I saw what he was doing I noticed that it might be possible to create a YouTube                |
| 04:41      | tab to create charts directed from shortcuts.                                                          |
| 04:44      | Yeah, that's one of the things I like about, I mean Charty for me is an app that kind                 |
| 04:49      | of stands in its own category because there are a lot of great tools for shortcuts where               |
| 04:55      | people have kind of built automations that Apple didn't really think to build or add                   |
| 05:01      | so they've kind of built in the gaps for us.                                                           |
| 05:04      | But Charty is an app and if you haven't seen it yet, listener, it's an app that you install           |
| 05:10      | and it adds charting tools to shortcuts.                                                               |
| 05:13      | So we were just talking before we went on mic, Rodrigo built one for OmniFocus that goes               |
| 05:19      | through and it looks at the number of tasks you check off every day versus the number                  |
| 05:24      | of tasks you add every day and we discovered that Rose is losing on a scale of two to one.             |
| 05:29      | A little over two to one actually for being honest, it's a hundred to forty.                           |
| 05:37      | So honestly every day you dig your hole deeper, which is not fun, but either way it's cool             |
| 05:43      | that you can visualise data out of shortcuts.                                                          |
| 05:45      | So it's an app that really creates kind of a feature in shortcuts that none of us ever                 |
| 05:51      | anticipated and I just love first of all that you have the idea to come up with it and secondly        |
| 05:57      | how well you've executed it.                                                                           |
| 05:58      | So congratulations to you.                                                                             |
| 06:00      | So yours, it means a lot coming from you guys.                                                         |
| 06:05      | It's impressive.                                                                                       |
| 06:06      | Well, it's not just us though because I mean, I've been watching this from fairly early                |
| 06:12      | on.                                                                                                    |
| 06:13      | I think you may have been retweeted by, it might have been [[Alex Hay\|Alex]] actually or it could                   |
| 06:17      | have been [[Simon StÃ¸vring\|Simon]] who makes [[Data Jar]] and [[Scriptable]].                                                      |
| 06:21      | I know both of them have retweeted what you're doing and it's really interesting to see                |
| 06:25      | all of these, all of you developers making things for that work with shortcuts, sharing                |
| 06:30      | each other's work.                                                                                     |
| 06:31      | It's really nice to see that as well, but I spotted it early on and a number of people                 |
| 06:35      | on Reddit especially who are absolutely nuts for Charty is so lovely to see and it really             |
| 06:42      | proves that you've done a nice job with this because it's so many people are using it and              |
| 06:46      | I guess some of them are probably using it in ways you never conceived, right?                         |
| 06:51      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 06:52      | First, it's been overwhelming seeing the community adoption of Charty and I have to say opening       |
| 06:58      | the beta early on was the best decision I could have taken in this process.                            |
| 07:03      | So if you're a developer hearing and you're working on something and you're tempted to                 |
| 07:08      | keep it a secret, don't do it.                                                                         |
| 07:10      | Charty within the world is a great way to build a community and also get feedback from                |
| 07:16      | everyone.                                                                                              |
| 07:17      | So these last couple, I guess it was in January, I submitted the first build to the public             |
| 07:23      | beta and I've gotten a lot of feature suggestions and bug reports and lots of things I wouldn't        |
| 07:30      | be able to check alone and it made [[Charty]] a lot better, a lot better.                                 |
| 07:35      | It's actually a work that I took multiple plans to build and it's been incredible seeing               |
| 07:44      | the community adoption of it.                                                                          |
| 07:46      | You spoke about [[Simon StÃ¸vring\|Simon]] and [[Alex Hay\|Alex]] and both great guys helping me a lot in the beginning, Alex             |
| 07:53      | sent me an email with lots of suggestions and features Charty should have and I believe               |
| 08:01      | I implemented each one of them and he's helped me a lot with this process.                             |
| 08:08      | [[Simon StÃ¸vring\|Simon]] also and concerning stuff that people were doing that I hadn't anticipated, some                 |
| 08:15      | users were using [[Charty]] to track turnip prices in Animal Crossing, and                              |
| 08:21      | I know you played it.                                                                                  |
| 08:23      | So it was really impressive.                                                                           |
| 08:26      | Yeah, it is a great app and like I said, it adds a feature.                                            |
| 08:32      | So like if you like to build shortcuts and you want data visualisation, something that                 |
| 08:36      | we thought we'd have to wait for Apple for and honestly I think we'd be waiting a long                 |
| 08:41      | time for Apple to get around to that.                                                                  |
| 08:43      | You can just download [[Charty]] now and start adding it and we've got a bunch of content                 |
| 08:48      | on [[Charty]] later in the show but I also want to talk to Rodrigo about just how he is an                |
| 08:54      | automator and some of his automations that he uses everyday.                                           |
| 08:58      | In fact, let's start there a little bit.                                                               |
| 09:00      | How did you get started with automation and what are your primary automation tools day                 |
| 09:04      | to day?                                                                                                |
| 09:06      | So as I said, I'm a computing engineer but in college I've studied most [[C++]] and [[Java]]                   |
| 09:14      | and both are not very easy to use languages and to deal with the files and stuff.                      |
| 09:23      | So I've never gotten beaten by the automators bug during college but when I learned [[Python]],            |
| 09:32      | everything changed.                                                                                    |
| 09:33      | I started automating file management in the UOS and I even went on to create a whole                   |
| 09:40      | web app to track a bad input we made a few friends in the World Cup of 2014.                           |
| 09:49      | So as a computer engineer, I mostly gravitated to using powerful languages to build automations        |
| 09:56      | but when workflow came out, it was an 'instabuy' for me.                                                 |
| 10:01      | I bought it instantly and started creating stuff with it because I already like to use                 |
| 10:06      | [[Launch Center Pro]] and this gets me to how I started building automations in the UOS.                   |
| 10:15      | It was around 2014 I guess that someone discovered we could use Launch Center Pro early, menu          |
| 10:23      | building actions to create a sort of questionnaire to automate daily logs to day one.                  |
| 10:32      | So you will obviously remember this.                                                                   |
| 10:35      | So I created a small questionnaire with seven questions and I was feeling them every day.              |
| 10:42      | I guess I did it for almost two years.                                                                 |
| 10:46      | It's really great.                                                                                     |
| 10:47      | I can see that this shortcut, it wasn't a shortcut at the time, it prompted me to                      |
| 10:52      | ask seven questions and then showed me a text box asking me if I had any longer thoughts               |
| 10:58      | about the day.                                                                                         |
| 11:00      | And then created a nice markdown form at the table in day one and it's great to see what               |
| 11:08      | I was thinking.                                                                                        |
| 11:09      | I was going through it yesterday preparing for the show and it's great to see what I                   |
| 11:13      | was thinking back in 2014 and 2015.                                                                    |
| 11:16      | It's really nice.                                                                                      |
| 11:17      | I mean, so often I really believe the start for this for a lot of people is small, easy                |
| 11:22      | automations like a daily check-in list.                                                                |
| 11:26      | It's just not that hard to make these things.                                                          |
| 11:28      | And I think it's creating that first one that really opens your eyes to what you can do                |
| 11:33      | with this stuff and suddenly automation becomes on the table when you hit the daily frustrations       |
| 11:40      | with your computer, but you've got to build that first one.                                            |
| 11:43      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 11:45      | And I've seen Rose suggest this in other episodes of Automators.                                       |
| 11:50      | One other very important thing about automating stuff is that you guarantee it's done properly.        |
| 11:57      | If I were building these markdown tables every day, I might forget one of the items or I               |
| 12:01      | might forget one underlining the table with it properly.                                               |
| 12:07      | So doing it through the automation makes it properly done and guarantees it's going to                 |
| 12:13      | work.                                                                                                  |
| 12:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:15      | I know how to make a table in markdown.                                                                |
| 12:17      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 12:18      | I know I know how to do it.                                                                            |
| 12:19      | But if you ask me to do it though and then you're watching me do it, I will 100% mess                  |
| 12:23      | it up.                                                                                                 |
| 12:24      | Absolutely guaranteed.                                                                                 |
| 12:25      | I'm not even allowing a slight margin from me getting it right.                                        |
| 12:28      | It's going to go wrong.                                                                                |
| 12:29      | And that's what happens when you do these things every day.                                            |
| 12:32      | And I'm really tempted.                                                                                |
| 12:33      | I think I'm going to be stealing your idea of just answering seven questions because                   |
| 12:37      | especially with shortcuts being able to prompt you and then being able to lock this data               |
| 12:40      | and then make a chart of it at the end of my week is part of my weekly review.                         |
| 12:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:45      | Yeah, yeah, I've ported that mentioned a pro action to short because if you want I can                 |
| 12:52      | share it with you.                                                                                     |
| 12:53      | That would be great actually if you could and then we'll put that in the show notes                    |
| 12:56      | for people.                                                                                            |
| 12:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:59      | Daily prompt is like a huge thing for a lot of folks and it does make a difference.                    |
| 13:03      | But yeah, I'd never really considered Rose visualising data with it with a Charty version.             |
| 13:09      | But if you, I guess if you kind of rated your day or rated your sleep or whatever, you could           |
| 13:14      | easily put something together with Charty and it can, it can start that information                    |
| 13:18      | in Data Jar with which is awesome.                                                                     |
| 13:22      | I've rewritten lots of my shortcuts using using Data Jar just to get better information                |
| 13:29      | stories than saving it in, in notes files.                                                             |
| 13:32      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 13:33      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 13:34      | I mean, that's, that's one of the key things that you have to look at with an automation,              |
| 13:38      | right?                                                                                                 |
| 13:39      | How are you going to store your data?                                                                  |
| 13:40      | And okay, maybe Data Jars and the solution for some people, they, they want to just save               |
| 13:43      | a dictionary as a file into iCloud or they just want to send a chart over to Charty and                |
| 13:48      | that's okay because they don't need the data, they just want the chart, but you, you have              |
| 13:52      | to decide how you're going to store your data.                                                         |
| 13:54      | And in some cases, as you found, it's great to go back and look at a couple of years entries           |
| 13:58      | in day one.                                                                                            |
| 14:00      | It is really remarkable how much third party developers have stepped in during iOS 13.                 |
| 14:06      | I mean, if you look at it, our show regularly, we're talking about third party apps.                   |
| 14:11      | We've already talked about Charty and Data Jar, you know, it's just, there's so many                   |
| 14:15      | ways that shortcuts is improved without Apple this year.                                               |
| 14:18      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 14:19      | Apple has given us a platform more than ever.                                                          |
| 14:22      | So we can now, it's almost like we're getting a new app store inside of, of shortcuts.                 |
| 14:28      | So we can build stuff just to, to, to improve it.                                                      |
| 14:33      | And Apple has been very, very nice to us, accepting all these, these different apps                    |
| 14:40      | in the store.                                                                                          |
| 14:41      | So when I was being Charty, I was actually kind of afraid cause I don't know if, I didn't              |
| 14:46      | know if they were considered a incomplete functionality for an app to be, to only be                   |
| 14:51      | able to, to get data input from, from shortcuts, but they were very, very, very nice to me.            |
| 14:56      | That would be a great addition to shortcuts there, wouldn't it?                                        |
| 14:59      | So inside the gallery, like have an apps section where they can showcase all of these great            |
| 15:03      | apps, you know, including Charty and toolbox pro and Data Jar and all of these amazing                 |
| 15:08      | things that really make shortcuts better.                                                              |
| 15:11      | I'm coding that on my WWDC wishlist, David, and I'm claiming that if, if that comes true,              |
| 15:16      | I'm getting a point.                                                                                   |
| 15:17      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 15:18      | Gold star for you.                                                                                     |
| 15:19      | We just talked about it on Mac, as we record this, the show hasn't published, but it will              |
| 15:24      | by the time the show goes out.                                                                         |
| 15:26      | And one of my wishes is that they don't make shortcuts for the Mac.                                    |
| 15:30      | I feel like there's too many things they need to fix on iOS.                                           |
| 15:35      | And we've got plenty of great short, we've got plenty of great automation.                             |
| 15:38      | Already on the Mac.                                                                                    |
| 15:40      | But I would like to see them just kind of locked down iOS, because this is really the                  |
| 15:43      | only game in town.                                                                                     |
| 15:45      | And we need to have not only great tools from, from you folks, but we also need to have Apple          |
| 15:52      | continuing to improve and push the ball forward.                                                       |
| 15:55      | I mean, one of the things I'd really like them to do is just give you more memory.                     |
| 15:58      | I know a lot of these.                                                                                 |
| 16:00      | That would be great.                                                                                   |
| 16:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 16:03      | Well, I guess while we're here, as the show releases, we're just a few days from, from                 |
| 16:07      | WWDC.                                                                                                  |
| 16:08      | As someone who develops a shortcut supporting app, what would you like to see Apple do to              |
| 16:15      | make it easier and better?                                                                             |
| 16:17      | So as Ken just said in the last episode of Automators, they've made a great job of unleashing          |
| 16:25      | this parameter power, action, short cut action power to us.                                            |
| 16:29      | So we've been well served in the, in this last year.                                                   |
| 16:33      | But there are still things we could get to, to make it better.                                         |
| 16:36      | One of the things would be to, to make it easier to create parent parameters.                          |
| 16:41      | And if you're, if you've never created a shortcut to, to get probably don't know what                  |
| 16:45      | this is, but it's the, you have noticed that when you changed some parameters in, in, in               |
| 16:51      | one of short, in one of the actions in shortcuts, sometimes the other parameters are modified.         |
| 16:58      | So some disappear, some reappear.                                                                      |
| 17:01      | These, these happens because the, that original parameter you changed, it's the, the parent            |
| 17:05      | parameter.                                                                                             |
| 17:06      | So it would be great to have more power over how to set these in the, in the while building            |
| 17:12      | the app.                                                                                               |
| 17:14      | But as a shortcut user, I'd love to have a way to, to make sort of a, it's, it's a                     |
| 17:21      | wild dream, but it would be great to have a scripting language that translates directly                |
| 17:26      | to shortcuts and translates back into the scripting language.                                          |
| 17:30      | So we can sometimes make, maybe write some things faster, you typing and then see the                  |
| 17:36      | little boxes we arranged.                                                                              |
| 17:39      | So it would be easier than dragons because we're, as we were speaking, the, that's a                   |
| 17:45      | shortcut.                                                                                              |
| 17:46      | I've been to, to compare the, the editing and completed tasks in new folks.                            |
| 17:50      | It has more than a hundred actions and it gets, it gets hard to keep scrolling and, and                |
| 17:55      | the pages refreshing and it's in a while.                                                              |
| 17:59      | So having a way to, to input that with text, it would be great.                                        |
| 18:02      | I think you win the moxie award though, a scripting language for shortcuts.                            |
| 18:06      | I, I, I think that's the problem.                                                                      |
| 18:08      | I don't know if they're going to go big or go home, right?                                             |
| 18:11      | If we don't wish for the amazing things, we might not get there.                                       |
| 18:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 18:14      | I know it's, it's borderline impossible, but we can dream, right?                                      |
| 18:19      | Well, a little bit of autocomplete and just essentially, you know, like essentially having             |
| 18:23      | you type the name of the action and then I don't know, curly brackets or something around              |
| 18:27      | your variable names and a whole, a healthy dose of autocomplete in there.                              |
| 18:31      | I think we'll make it accessible for people and, you know, drag and drop would still be                |
| 18:35      | there.                                                                                                 |
| 18:36      | If you don't have a keyboard attached, I would suggest if you, if you have a Bluetooth                 |
| 18:38      | keyboard attached, then you get this option otherwise, you know, drag and drop for you.                |
| 18:42      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 18:43      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 18:44      | Well, it is a huge problem though.                                                                     |
| 18:45      | I mean, I, I mean, just the other day I was working on a long shortcut and I was trying                |
| 18:49      | to scroll to the bottom and in the process I, I moved in action, you know, just finger                 |
| 18:55      | lingers just a little too long and says, this isn't a scroll.                                          |
| 18:57      | This is a grab.                                                                                        |
| 18:58      | And then I had to spend 10 minutes undoing what I did because I wasn't sure what it was                |
| 19:02      | because not only did I move in action, the scroll did it eventually engage and I don't                 |
| 19:07      | even know where it was.                                                                                |
| 19:08      | See, that's actually my wish.                                                                          |
| 19:10      | My wish is really simple.                                                                              |
| 19:11      | I would really like at the bottom where they've got the undo arrow and the redo arrow and              |
| 19:16      | the share and the play.                                                                                |
| 19:17      | I would really like a little arrow that just points downwards inside of that, which just               |
| 19:21      | scrolls me to the bottom at the moment.                                                                |
| 19:23      | Like I just, usually I just add an action, which scrolls me to the bottom and then I                   |
| 19:27      | delete that action, but it's a, it's a hack you work around.                                           |
| 19:29      | I really like a button that just takes me to the end of my shortcut.                                   |
| 19:34      | You can, you can see me, but I was pointing at the screen.                                             |
| 19:36      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 19:37      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 19:38      | The one where you were saying you went away to, to go to the bottom and your, your hack,               |
| 19:42      | even though it's a hack, but I haven't thought of it.                                                  |
| 19:44      | I'm going to start using it this way.                                                                  |
| 19:46      | It works really well on the iPad in landscape mode because you have your, your shortcuts               |
| 19:51      | on the left hand side.                                                                                 |
| 19:52      | iPhone, not so great because you, you have to open the action list.                                    |
| 19:57      | And then in my case at the moment, I have a lot of actions with shortcuts in them, unsurprisingly.     |
| 20:03      | And so when I open that apps and actions list, it can take a little while to load sometimes.           |
| 20:08      | And I'm just sort of sitting there looking at a screen.                                                |
| 20:11      | And then it pops up with something and it's like, okay, now I can tap on this and it's                 |
| 20:15      | showing me very weird actions as well.                                                                 |
| 20:17      | Like it's showing me the option to, to call somebody who I've literally never called in                |
| 20:22      | my life.                                                                                               |
| 20:23      | Um, and I know because I've checked the records, um, yes, but it's, it's a hack and it works.          |
| 20:29      | So if people are desperately in need of building hundreds of action long shortcuts, then, uh,          |
| 20:34      | there you go.                                                                                          |
| 20:35      | That's it.                                                                                             |
| 20:36      | That's a tip for you today.                                                                            |
| 20:37      | You know, honestly, what I'd like is for the shortcuts team just to use Keyboard Maestro               |
| 20:40      | for a week.                                                                                            |
| 20:41      | I mean, and you know, I'm kind of flipping about that.                                                 |
| 20:46      | The people on shortcuts and they're really smart.                                                      |
| 20:48      | They know all this stuff, but you know, it's just priorities and time.                                 |
| 20:51      | But you know, Keyboard Maestro has the ability to fold up blocks so you can fold them up               |
| 20:56      | so you don't have to do that.                                                                          |
| 20:58      | They have the ability to lock blocks and they have the ability to colour code blocks.                   |
| 21:03      | And for anybody that makes long shortcuts, those three items together are what makes                   |
| 21:09      | it easy.                                                                                               |
| 21:10      | You know, like I, I have some very long Keyboard Maestro scripts that do text replacement in           |
| 21:15      | Microsoft Word.                                                                                        |
| 21:16      | And, uh, I just have the top block of each section is orange and it's mixed.                           |
| 21:21      | So easy for me to get through, manage that and not screw it up as I'm working on that                  |
| 21:25      | script.                                                                                                |
| 21:26      | Whereas with, um, you know, shortcuts, it's kind of the wild west still.                               |
| 21:29      | Well, you know what else exists in Keyboard Maestro, it's not in shortcuts.                            |
| 21:34      | Copy and paste.                                                                                        |
| 21:35      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 21:36      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 21:37      | I'm just the most obvious one.                                                                         |
| 21:38      | You're right.                                                                                          |
| 21:39      | Just the ability.                                                                                      |
| 21:40      | Man, I would love some copy and paste though.                                                          |
| 21:42      | I have to say if I'm, if I'm copying and pasting sections nowadays, what I usually do is I duplicate   |
| 21:47      | my shortcut and I remove the extra actions that I don't want and then I turn it into                   |
| 21:51      | a mini subroutine shortcut.                                                                            |
| 21:54      | Because then, you know, it's inevitable that I'm going to reuse this multiple places.                  |
| 21:58      | I have a, a special mini shortcut for formatting calendar items in my preferred one line format.       |
| 22:04      | And that's just something that I use in so many places now, but it started out as something            |
| 22:08      | that was in two shortcuts and then I went, hold up a minute.                                           |
| 22:14      | The problem with using creating other shortcuts, it's, it makes it harder to, to share them.           |
| 22:20      | So as many of my shortcuts nowadays are meant to be shared with, either with Charlie or                |
| 22:27      | on the website, I have, I keep trying to, to stuff everything in one single shortcut                   |
| 22:32      | so it makes it easier to, to share everything.                                                         |
| 22:35      | I would actually really like the ability when you share a shortcut, if it has the run shortcut         |
| 22:40      | action inside of it, it would be really great.                                                         |
| 22:43      | If it was just like, Hey, this has a run shortcut action.                                              |
| 22:45      | Would you like me to extract the actions from that run shortcut or from those run shortcut             |
| 22:50      | actions and embed them in, in your super shortcut?                                                     |
| 22:55      | That would be amazing.                                                                                 |
| 22:56      | That would be amazing.                                                                                 |
| 22:58      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 22:59      | Do you see any performance hit by running it as a subroutine?                                          |
| 23:02      | Cause I don't, I'll tell you, I've tried to, you know, look at shortcuts I've built just               |
| 23:07      | running sub shortcuts as subroutines versus ones where I embed them.                                   |
| 23:11      | And it seems to me like they run just as fast.                                                         |
| 23:13      | I mean, I actually had an important performance improvement this week.                                 |
| 23:17      | I had a single shortcut for clocking in and clocking out at work.                                      |
| 23:21      | And I decided to create two separate shortcuts, one for clocking in, one for clocking out.             |
| 23:25      | And they literally just passed the text, clock in and clock out to the main shortcut.                  |
| 23:29      | I'm going to replace the menu option in there and it runs so much faster now.                          |
| 23:33      | I have no idea why.                                                                                    |
| 23:35      | It's amazing.                                                                                          |
| 23:36      | It's like magic.                                                                                       |
| 23:37      | It's interesting.                                                                                      |
| 23:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:39      | While we are in the shortcuts desires, I'd love to have some directives, programming                   |
| 23:48      | directives inside shortcuts, just like something to break out of a loop or to continue a loop          |
| 23:54      | and forgive all the other, forget all the other actions below it.                                      |
| 23:59      | It's the break and continue directives we have in programming languages.                               |
| 24:03      | It would be great to have them in shortcuts too.                                                       |
| 24:07      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 24:08      | So, now that we've solved all of Apple's problems, I'd actually like to talk about                     |
| 24:15      | some of your shortcuts, Rodrigo, starting with the, usually with the show, we'd like                   |
| 24:20      | to have kind of a small automation or a simple one and a more advanced one.                            |
| 24:25      | Let's start with a simple one.                                                                         |
| 24:27      | And you've got a cool one that you're willing to share with the audience about saving receipts.        |
| 24:30      | Tell us about that.                                                                                    |
| 24:31      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 24:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:33      | This one is very simple.                                                                               |
| 24:35      | But when I thought of it, I was really happy because it's something that took a lot of                 |
| 24:41      | time every month and most of the times I did it wrong.                                                 |
| 24:45      | So, this started when we were just, we just got married in 2016 and we were in a rented                |
| 24:54      | apartment and we had to pay all the bills and guarantee we had the receipts saved.                     |
| 24:59      | So whenever the owner of the apartment ever wanted to see it, to confirm something, we                 |
| 25:06      | could show him the receipts.                                                                           |
| 25:09      | So I started saving each bill receipt in a Google Drive folder and rename it with the                  |
| 25:16      | name of the bill, whether it was cable, internet, rent or whatever.                                    |
| 25:24      | And the data, I paid it.                                                                               |
| 25:27      | So, every time I was going to save it, I was asking myself, is it the name first or the                |
| 25:35      | date first and what's the format of the date and what's the folder and whatever.                       |
| 25:41      | So I lost a lot of time every time I had to pay bill.                                                  |
| 25:44      | So after a few months doing this, I figured this was the word for an automation, not for               |
| 25:52      | me.                                                                                                    |
| 25:53      | And then we're distracted, it just asks the user for which the bill is paying and then                 |
| 26:02      | renames the PDF, sorry, it accepts the PDF file as input and so it shows in the spreadsheet.           |
| 26:12      | So whenever I pay something in the bank, I get to export the receipt as a PDF and just                 |
| 26:16      | run distracted.                                                                                        |
| 26:17      | Then it asks me, so yes.                                                                               |
| 26:20      | So, when you capture the PDF, are you doing that with the camera or are you just getting               |
| 26:25      | some things from the email to you?                                                                     |
| 26:26      | I guess both.                                                                                          |
| 26:27      | Actually, it's neither.                                                                                |
| 26:29      | My bank, when I pay the bills through their app, it provides me an option to export the                |
| 26:37      | receipt as a PDF automatically.                                                                        |
| 26:39      | So I do this.                                                                                          |
| 26:40      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 26:41      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 26:42      | And then it automatically opens the spreadsheet and I can select the save receipt shortcuts.           |
| 26:47      | Perfect.                                                                                               |
| 26:48      | So the first thing you do is you do a choose from list where you've got a list of different            |
| 26:52      | bill sources and the version you're sharing has cable, internet, phone, and rent.                      |
| 26:58      | So you can categorise it and then you're using a text field to add the date.                           |
| 27:04      | So you're putting the current date plus the name of whichever one you chose.                           |
| 27:09      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 27:10      | And then formatting the data is an ISO 8601 format.                                                    |
| 27:14      | But you see the only way it should be done, I'll say.                                                  |
| 27:18      | It's the correct way, yes.                                                                             |
| 27:22      | I will caveat that and say, well, I do like the ISO format.                                            |
| 27:26      | I usually just limit it to the date part and I don't do the time part because most of the              |
| 27:31      | time, especially with things like bills, I don't need to know what time I paid it.                     |
| 27:34      | I just need to know the date that I paid it on.                                                        |
| 27:37      | I do that too.                                                                                         |
| 27:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 27:39      | If you open the current date in the chart, because you see the time format is set as none.             |
| 27:43      | So and then it gets this file name that was created and using the text action and passes               |
| 27:50      | that to a save file action to save it in an iCloud drive.                                              |
| 27:56      | I just added some extra folders.                                                                       |
| 27:59      | So I have a folder called receipts inside shortcuts and inside of it, I have a folder                  |
| 28:05      | for each one of the bill types.                                                                        |
| 28:07      | So I used the item that was chosen in the list in the beginning of the chart to define                 |
| 28:12      | the folder into which they should be saved and then save the file.                                     |
| 28:17      | And lastly, to give me a complete piece of mind, I opened my repetitive actions project                |
| 28:22      | in OmniFocus and in there, I just tapped the dot button for that bill and I'm free for                 |
| 28:32      | one month.                                                                                             |
| 28:33      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 28:34      | I should possibly note for people who download the shortcut because it's great, but you've             |
| 28:38      | used the link which has your specific perspective and so anybody who downloads this like me            |
| 28:43      | needs to take a look at that and add your own perspective link because I do not speak                  |
| 28:48      | Portuguese, but I can see that it's something like repeating actions or something like that.           |
| 28:55      | So I'm not going to try and pronounce that.                                                            |
| 28:58      | I think I would embarrass myself and possibly everybody who's a Portuguese speaker as well.            |
| 29:02      | Well, I've already done it, Rose.                                                                      |
| 29:05      | So I think you should.                                                                                 |
| 29:06      | All right, how do I pronounce the C with the circumflex or it's like a, it's like a, let               |
| 29:12      | us see, uh, it's like a double words.                                                                  |
| 29:14      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 29:15      | So as you'll strip it to this repetitive, no, I can't, uh, the second, the second try                  |
| 29:22      | was better.                                                                                            |
| 29:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:24      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 29:25      | There we go.                                                                                           |
| 29:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:27      | It's, it's, uh, so it's repetitive us.                                                                 |
| 29:28      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 29:29      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 29:30      | Thank you.                                                                                             |
| 29:31      | I'll let, I'll let a comment above it and just, uh, saying, uh, stating that the user                  |
| 29:35      | should, should, should replace it with this.                                                           |
| 29:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:38      | But yes, I mean, that's the thing with everything, but this is a really easy change for anybody        |
| 29:42      | to make you downloads that they can just replace that with the appropriate perspective.                |
| 29:46      | And I have to tell you, I'm going to be staying, seeing the shortcut cause I'm, I'm sorting            |
| 29:49      | out my, my new place pretty soon and I'm going to have to deal with some receipts like this            |
| 29:53      | and so on.                                                                                             |
| 29:54      | So it's going to be useful to have that.                                                               |
| 29:55      | So thank you.                                                                                          |
| 29:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 29:57      | It's helpful.                                                                                          |
| 29:58      | And I'll say your English is much better than my Portuguese, but definitely.                           |
| 30:02      | Yeah, uh, what, one thing you've done in here that I like, and I think it's a good tip for             |
| 30:07      | people is you have, so you have the choose from list for the name.                                     |
| 30:11      | Like I said, you know, really cable rent, whatever, but that I think something you didn't              |
| 30:15      | hear that was pretty clever was you did make sub folders for each one and the sub folder               |
| 30:20      | where, where the shortcut declares the location where it's going to save it.                           |
| 30:25      | The actual path is includes the variable.                                                              |
| 30:28      | So like if you do say rent, then it, it goes to the rent sub folder, which, you know, the              |
| 30:34      | idea of putting a variable in a path is not something everybody would immediately think                |
| 30:38      | of.                                                                                                    |
| 30:39      | And I think it was pretty smart.                                                                       |
| 30:40      | So that's another trick that you may want to use if you're listening to this and just                  |
| 30:44      | check out the shortcut for that idea.                                                                  |
| 30:46      | I do really dislike how you have to save the shortcuts documents to the shortcut sub folder.           |
| 30:53      | I think that gets in the way of a lot of other automation on the back end, like if you want            |
| 30:57      | to have something like [[Hazel]] on your mat, go through and do it.                                        |
| 31:00      | You've got to, you know, you've got to add extra steps for it, but what are you going                  |
| 31:04      | to do?                                                                                                 |
| 31:05      | Yeah, I was actually bothered by this when I created this shortcut and I almost went                   |
| 31:10      | to if the drop box, but I thought drive is, is, is nicer and it's, it's easier to, to                  |
| 31:17      | use it in iOS.                                                                                         |
| 31:18      | So I kind of settled to, to use my receipts, save my receipts inside the shortcuts for                 |
| 31:23      | this.                                                                                                  |
| 31:24      | And then that on, on my end, because I don't like that is I actually have set up some [[Hazel]]            |
| 31:28      | rules that monitor those sub folders on iCloud drive and anything that comes in, they move             |
| 31:34      | to my standard action folder on my drive.                                                              |
| 31:37      | So then all the other [[Hazel]] goodness that may go into effect in terms of filing or emailing            |
| 31:43      | or whatever happens on, on the end.                                                                    |
| 31:45      | So I kind of combine this with some automation on the Mac to solve that problem.                       |
| 31:49      | I do something similar.                                                                                |
| 31:52      | I have things.                                                                                         |
| 31:53      | I say things to draw box through shortcuts and then everything I saved to draw box pretty              |
| 31:58      | much goes inside of a sub folder where [[Hazel]] just yanks it out and moves it to the right               |
| 32:02      | place for me.                                                                                          |
| 32:03      | And in some cases I do just have, you know, a mimicked folder structure and it moves it                |
| 32:08      | into other places, but then this allows me to access it through Zapier and all sorts of                |
| 32:11      | other amazing options.                                                                                 |
| 32:14      | I think it would be fun with this shortcut also to make a version where you do the scan                |
| 32:19      | with the built in scanning mechanism on the iPhone.                                                    |
| 32:22      | I mean, you could do that.                                                                             |
| 32:24      | I mean, you can just check whether or not there's an input, right?                                     |
| 32:27      | And say if the, if the input is non-existent, then scan.                                               |
| 32:30      | Yes, you can do that.                                                                                  |
| 32:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:33      | And then I believe you could do the OCR through one of the third party shortcuts.                      |
| 32:38      | Toolbox pro.                                                                                           |
| 32:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:40      | Toolbox pro.                                                                                           |
| 32:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:42      | I am just looking at this and toolbox pro has the scanned document and you can return                  |
| 32:46      | either the recognised text or the scanned images.                                                      |
| 32:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:50      | Does it return it as a PDF with embedded text?                                                         |
| 32:53      | That's what we really, I think, would want.                                                            |
| 32:55      | I'm not sure.                                                                                          |
| 32:56      | I'm good.                                                                                              |
| 32:57      | I'm going to keep looking.                                                                             |
| 32:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:59      | That would be a nice addition.                                                                         |
| 33:00      | You know, it's getting more powerful, but I mean, yeah.                                                |
| 33:04      | And then the other piece of this that people may want to customise like we talked about                |
| 33:07      | earlier is what do you do with it?                                                                     |
| 33:09      | We're putting an iCloud with this script, but you could send it to Dropbox or you could,               |
| 33:14      | you know, you could email it to your landlord, you know, you could build an automatic mailing          |
| 33:19      | into this or you could, I believe you could also like put it into Dev and Think or one                 |
| 33:25      | of these data store apps too.                                                                          |
| 33:27      | So there's a lot you could, this is a great starting point.                                            |
| 33:29      | Thanks for sharing this.                                                                               |
| 33:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 33:31      | You could even store when you paid what bill in Data Jar and bill a chart to show how frequently        |
| 33:37      | you're paying your bills and how much you're paying and whether or not your bills have                 |
| 33:40      | gone up over time.                                                                                     |
| 33:42      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 33:43      | Some users have been using charted to create an express tracker.                                       |
| 33:49      | So they might be, this might be a nice use for just how much was it and then add to Data Jar            |
| 33:57      | dictionary.                                                                                            |
| 33:58      | We are very quickly making our simple automation, not so simple guys.                                  |
| 34:01      | Well, the good news is, is the version that's going to be downloadable in the show notes               |
| 34:05      | is pretty simple.                                                                                      |
| 34:06      | And so you can, everybody is welcome to download that and use it as a jumping off point for            |
| 34:11      | their own automations.                                                                                 |

| 35:18      | Okay, so the next automation that you've built for us, Rodrigo, or that you've built for               |
| 35:24      | yourself, I should say, and that you're currently sharing with us, is one very near and dear           |
| 35:29      | to my heart.                                                                                           |
| 35:30      | It's all about tracking book progress.                                                                 |
| 35:31      | And I love reading.                                                                                    |
| 35:32      | I'm guessing from the look of this shortcut that you also love reading.                                |
| 35:36      | What does it do for the people who, unlike me, have not yet seen it?                                   |
| 35:41      | Okay, so I do love reading, and I tend to read mostly fantasy books.                                   |
| 35:48      | So think about the Game of Thrones and the Way of Kings and anything by Brennan Sanderson.             |
| 35:54      | So these are usually big books, and I noticed I wasn't reading as much as I'd like, by                 |
| 36:01      | the end of 2017, I guess.                                                                              |
| 36:02      | So I decided to start reading more, and as I was saying, yes, as usual goes the diligence              |
| 36:10      | is key.                                                                                                |
| 36:11      | So I had to force myself to start reading every day, and then I set a daily goal for                   |
| 36:18      | how much pages or positions in the keynote I should progress every day, and I was trying               |
| 36:24      | to stick to that.                                                                                      |
| 36:25      | But as soon as I realised that my memory is in the best way to start that information,                 |
| 36:33      | and then I started starting everything into a Note 5 and iOS Notes app.                                |
| 36:39      | So I had a date, I just started the date and the position I was in the book.                           |
| 36:46      | But soon I realised I needed a way to visualise this.                                                  |
| 36:49      | So I was exporting, this was long before charting, it was in 2018 or 2019, and I was exporting         |
| 36:57      | this data to Excel and building charts over there to visualise my progress.                            |
| 37:03      | But it was cumbersome, because it was so troublesome, I didn't do it as much as I'd like.              |
| 37:11      | So when I released charting and having Toolbox Pro and Data Jar, I set out to bid this one,               |
| 37:19      | and it actually comprises three different shortcuts into one.                                          |
| 37:24      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 37:25      | What's the first shortcut then?                                                                        |
| 37:28      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 37:29      | So whenever you run it, the shortcut uses Toolbox Pro, awesome quick menu action to show                |
| 37:35      | you a nice menu with icons and everything.                                                             |
| 37:39      | And it then asks you whether you want to start a new book, to log your progress on an existing         |
| 37:46      | book, or to charge your progress in your books already already.                                        |
| 37:52      | So the first one, it actually uses a hack for shortcuts, it's kind of a hack, to ask                   |
| 37:59      | multiple inputs from the user at once.                                                                 |
| 38:02      | So it fuses a dictionary with the book name, the start position, and the end position,                 |
| 38:08      | and the daily goal for a rating.                                                                       |
| 38:11      | And these fields are filled with the action ask each time.                                             |
| 38:15      | So whenever you run it, and I select the new book, it will show you the dictionary in                  |
| 38:20      | the screen, and ask you to fill these fields.                                                          |
| 38:23      | This is nice because you can fill all of this information all at once, and just do it once             |
| 38:30      | and you'll be done with it.                                                                            |
| 38:33      | And then it creates two actual lists for this dictionary, one for dates, the dates you read,           |
| 38:40      | and one for your progress on each of these dates.                                                      |
| 38:43      | And it has this dictionary to a list of dictionaries in Data Jar.                                       |
| 38:50      | So it's saved over there.                                                                              |
| 38:51      | This is the first one.                                                                                 |
| 38:53      | The second one is the log progress.                                                                    |
| 38:54      | So whenever you step on log progress, it asks you in which position of the book you are,               |
| 39:00      | and it then adds one entry to each of the lists I said.                                                |
| 39:04      | So it has the current date for the dates list of that book, the book you selected, and the             |
| 39:12      | position for the progress list for that book.                                                          |
| 39:17      | And the last one is the chart progress.                                                                |
| 39:20      | So this one is processed these lists and creates a chart showing you how you should be progressing     |
| 39:28      | if you were sticking to your data go, how you are actually progressing, the in which position          |
| 39:34      | you are, and it also, it's something new I added yesterday, especially for the show.                   |
| 39:42      | It adds a third line showing you when you're going to end the book, if you continue in                 |
| 39:48      | the base, you've been doing in reality.                                                                |
| 39:53      | So then it gives you a notification, a notification and shows you the chart with that information.     |
| 40:01      | That's a lot of information, but I'm really liking it.                                                 |
| 40:05      | So basically, it allows me to plan for when I should be finishing my book.                             |
| 40:12      | So what you're telling me is I can put more books on my reading list because I'm going                 |
| 40:15      | to know when I'm finishing my current book, right?                                                     |
| 40:18      | That's how this works.                                                                                 |
| 40:20      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 40:21      | You can start your new house with new books.                                                           |
| 40:26      | Yes, or maybe I'll just fill my Kindle menu place isn't that big, I have to say.                       |
| 40:30      | I think I might run out of room if I build my own personal library as much as I'd like                 |
| 40:34      | it to be otherwise.                                                                                    |
| 40:37      | I mean, what you've really done here is you've made a book reading and tracking application            |
| 40:42      | using shortcuts that that wasn't possible with what we got in iOS 13.0 with the shortcuts,             |
| 40:51      | but when you add things like Data Jar and Charty, it's kind of a full-fledged application.             |
| 40:58      | And that's why I'm really pleased that you're willing to share this so everybody can download          |
| 41:02      | it and look through it.                                                                                |
| 41:03      | But you want to make an application to track things.                                                   |
| 41:08      | This is a perfect model for you.                                                                       |
| 41:10      | And when you run the product, it feels like an app that you would buy in the App Store,                |
| 41:15      | right?                                                                                                 |
| 41:16      | I'm just so impressed with the way you put this together.                                              |
| 41:18      | Yeah, I was actually, I'm not the first one to do this.                                                |
| 41:22      | The lots of users have been building great applications.                                               |
| 41:25      | You can see them in the Automator's Forum or in the Reddit shortcuts.                                  |
| 41:29      | The basis of all this is getting a way to build nice UIs using Toolbox Pro Quick Menus                    |
| 41:36      | and storing data using Data Jar and then, in the case of this shortcut, visualise data                  |
| 41:44      | using Charty.                                                                                         |
| 41:45      | So it's a lot of moving pieces getting together to build something like this.                          |
| 41:50      | But it's impressive what Alex and Simon built, so it enables us to build this.                         |
| 41:57      | And it's completely accessible to anybody.                                                             |
| 41:59      | I mean, if you're listening to the show and you take a look at the shortcut, you can customise         |
| 42:04      | this to your own data tracking that you need to do.                                                    |
| 42:07      | Maybe it's the number of glasses of water you drink a day or the amount of time you                    |
| 42:12      | spend on your passion project or whatever.                                                             |
| 42:14      | This stuff works, and it's very easy to modify this stuff.                                             |
| 42:18      | But I left out 2Box Pro, but I mean, there's three third-party apps that are making this               |
| 42:23      | possible.                                                                                              |
| 42:24      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 42:25      | Let's keep growing.                                                                                    |
| 42:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 42:27      | I love the fact that shortcuts really has become a framework, though, because theoretically            |
| 42:33      | I could store and lock this data just using shortcuts, right?                                          |
| 42:39      | But I wouldn't have the pretty visual menus, and I certainly wouldn't have the ability                 |
| 42:44      | to go into another application and extract all that data in a format that's fairly visual.             |
| 42:48      | I'd have to store, as say, a JSON file in iCloud Drive, which for a lot of people, you know,           |
| 42:54      | you say the word JSON file and they just turn off.                                                     |
| 42:57      | So for those people who are there, I just want to be able to store my data somewhere                   |
| 43:01      | with shortcuts, you know, could maybe use the global variables from 2Box Pro or something,             |
| 43:06      | but being able to have a whole database there is great.                                                |
| 43:09      | Now, I do have a very important question for you, which I'm hoping you're going to be able             |
| 43:13      | to answer because on a quick scroll through, I didn't spot it here.                                    |
| 43:16      | What happens when I complete a book?                                                                   |
| 43:18      | Actually, you can't, you just log that you're in the last position of the book.                        |
| 43:26      | So whenever you finish the, you plot the chart, it will remove the, it will not add the projection     |
| 43:33      | line.                                                                                                  |
| 43:34      | So it just checks for that.                                                                            |
| 43:36      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 43:37      | So if I were to say log that I have finished the book that I have, I've actually not yet               |
| 43:43      | finished.                                                                                              |
| 43:44      | I only just started it today.                                                                          |
| 43:45      | It's by Patrick Rothfuss, the wise man's fear.                                                         |
| 43:48      | When I next run it and I tap log progress, I can still log my progress on it so I could                |
| 43:54      | restart that book.                                                                                     |
| 43:55      | I quite like that.                                                                                     |
| 43:56      | It's handy.                                                                                            |
| 43:57      | And I can see that I may have to add some custom alert or something that shows me a                    |
| 44:04      | congratulations.                                                                                       |
| 44:05      | You finished your book option.                                                                         |
| 44:06      | That could be a stretch goal for all listeners.                                                        |
| 44:08      | Yeah, that'd be nice.                                                                                  |
| 44:10      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 44:11      | I can't let this go by without giving you a suggestion for a book.                                     |
| 44:15      | If you like fantasy, the Temeraire series, are you familiar with that?                               |
| 44:19      | No.                                                                                                    |
| 44:20      | It's Naomi Novak and it's the Napoleonic Wars with dragons.                                            |
| 44:27      | That's all I'll say.                                                                                   |
| 44:28      | Come on.                                                                                               |
| 44:29      | I have to read this now.                                                                               |
| 44:32      | It's good.                                                                                             |
| 44:33      | It's really good.                                                                                      |
| 44:34      | Seriously.                                                                                             |
| 44:35      | Anyway, I really like this shortcut.                                                                   |
| 44:41      | And like I said earlier, the combination of these third party tools just ups the game.                 |
| 44:46      | You have better menus.                                                                                 |
| 44:47      | You have data visualisation.                                                                           |
| 44:49      | And this is not, you know, when we ask guests sometimes for a more complicated automation,             |
| 44:55      | sometimes they're inscrutable because they're so complicated.                                          |
| 44:58      | This is, you can actually track this if you've got a decent knowledge of the way shortcuts             |
| 45:02      | works.                                                                                                 |
| 45:03      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 45:04      | The way to understand this shortcut, and I try to divide it into three parts.                          |
| 45:09      | So it's the, you have to face this as three different targets.                                         |
| 45:15      | The one to add the book, the one to log the book, your progress, and the one to chart                  |
| 45:18      | your results.                                                                                          |
| 45:19      | So if you analyse it like this, you just get three smaller ones.                                       |
| 45:23      | So in each one of them, I didn't use nested ifs because they, in shortcuts, they just                  |
| 45:30      | get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.                                                       |
| 45:32      | So I used three different ifs to check which shortcut you're creating, you're using.                   |
| 45:40      | And these, you can see the first two, the two, yes, the first ones are just less than                  |
| 45:47      | actions.                                                                                               |
| 45:48      | The bigger one is the one for charting because it calculates the projection of how, when               |
| 45:52      | you're going to end the book.                                                                          |
| 45:54      | And I have to say, prior to this, to this episode, to yesterday, I was using actually                  |
| 46:00      | two shortcuts.                                                                                         |
| 46:01      | I was adding the book, tracking these books as notes files, in notes.                                  |
| 46:07      | And I had the shortcuts was a lot bigger because I had to process the text and get actions             |
| 46:13      | and dates and all that using Data Jar made it a lot smaller and made it easier to process              |
| 46:19      | everything.                                                                                            |
| 46:20      | Well, I like the sound of the fact that being on, being on automators has inspired you to              |
| 46:26      | improve your own automations because that's something that I feel everybody can do if                  |
| 46:31      | you've got a little bit of time.                                                                       |
| 46:32      | So.                                                                                                    |
| 46:33      | Yeah, that's one more thing I would like to see Apple improve using notes with automation              |
| 46:38      | is very difficult because Apple notes really isn't that friendly to shortcuts.                         |
| 46:42      | Yeah, the, the fine notes is actually a source of headaches every time I try to use it until           |
| 46:48      | I can remember the exact way to, to search for a note and get the note title and whatever              |
| 46:55      | it takes me a while every time.                                                                        |
| 46:56      | So.                                                                                                    |
| 46:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:58      | So almost every application has a way to identify specific note or piece of data to identify           |
| 47:06      | through shortcuts.                                                                                     |
| 47:08      | Apple notes does not.                                                                                  |
| 47:09      | So I create like a little hash at the bottom of random characters that would only show                 |
| 47:14      | up in that note.                                                                                       |
| 47:15      | So I, in this instance, create my own, I guess, UID for.                                               |
| 47:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 47:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 47:21      | See, I have a very simple solution to all of this.                                                     |
| 47:24      | I use Drafts, which has universally unique IDs for every draft.                                        |
| 47:28      | And when I need to, I store those IDs either in air table or in Data Jar or in some cases              |
| 47:34      | both.                                                                                                  |
| 47:35      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 47:36      | Both.                                                                                                  |
| 47:37      | I've gone there.                                                                                       |
| 47:38      | I wouldn't recommend that for, for everybody, but I'm experimenting with something which               |
| 47:41      | may appear on a future episode.                                                                        |
| 47:43      | So I decided to, to go all out.                                                                        |
| 47:45      | If my world crashes and burns is because I'm storing the same data in too many places.                 |
| 47:49      | Remember gross busters?                                                                                |
| 47:50      | I shouldn't be crossing the streams, but I'm doing it anyway.                                          |
| 47:53      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 47:54      | Never cross the streams.                                                                               |
| 47:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 47:56      | As David said, if you're starting notes in iOS, the correct way is using what they've                  |
| 48:02      | said for about ISO 8601 for dates.                                                                     |
| 48:05      | If you're starting notes in iOS, the best, the correct way is the Drafts.                              |
| 48:09      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 48:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 48:11      | No kidding.                                                                                            |

| 48:59      | imprint PDFs with custom stamps before giving them to others.                                          |
| 49:04      | As an example, when I save a draft contract to DEVONthink, I use the imprint tool to put               |
| 49:09      | a draft sticker across the front of it before I send it to opposing counsel or my client.              |
| 49:15      | Then you can organise your documents in any way you want.                                              |
| 49:18      | Smart groups let you create different views on your data.                                              |
| 49:21      | Integrated artificial intelligence assists you with filing and searching.                              |
| 49:25      | You can even automate your workflow and create smart rules to add flexible reminders to any            |
| 49:30      | document.                                                                                              |
| 49:31      | With DEVONthink, they even let non-programmers easily automate many parts of the workflow.             |
| 49:37      | DEVONthink's a great fit for the automators because there is so many great automation                  |
| 49:41      | tools built right in.                                                                                  |
| 49:43      | With DEVONthink, you can take your data to DEVONthink's iOS companion app as well.                     |

| 50:01      | Our thanks to DEVONtechnologies for their support of the automators and all of RelayFM.               |
| 50:07      | All right, let's spend a minute talking about Charty.                                                 |
| 50:11      | We covered at the top of the show, but this is an application that you download and it                 |
| 50:16      | adds a whole bunch of actions to shortcuts that allows you to visualise data and you've                |
| 50:21      | got all these different chart types you can use and it's really kind of awesome.                       |
| 50:25      | If you like making shortcuts, this is definitely a tool you want to add to your toolbox.               |
| 50:33      | But I thought it'd be fun to talk a little bit about crazy ways people are using your                  |
| 50:37      | application because now that it's out in the world, I'm sure you're seeing all sorts of                |
| 50:41      | interesting uses.                                                                                      |
| 50:42      | Yes, as I said, some users were using to track the turning prices in the animal crossing               |
| 50:48      | and that was unexpected.                                                                               |
| 50:52      | Lots of users are using it to track stuff in the house app from Apple.                                 |
| 50:59      | One of them even went to a lot of steps further and he was tracking his weight and his daily           |
| 51:08      | activities.                                                                                            |
| 51:09      | I guess he was running and cycling.                                                                    |
| 51:11      | There were two types and he had bar charts of the calories he spent in each of these                   |
| 51:17      | activities every day and he was cross-referencing it with the ice scatter plot of his weight           |
| 51:26      | every day also and he took it lots of steps further and he actually calculated the linear              |
| 51:32      | regression of whether his weight was going down or up and then he added that line to                   |
| 51:39      | the chart and it was pretty impressive what he's done.                                                 |
| 51:43      | Wow, that sounds like somebody who's really motivated as well because I kind of feel like              |
| 51:48      | one of the great ways to motivate yourself to do things is to build a cool automation                  |
| 51:52      | so that you can then use it every day or is that just me who likes to use automation as                |
| 51:58      | a carrot?                                                                                              |
| 51:59      | I have to agree with you.                                                                              |
| 52:01      | My book tracking automation has helped me read more.                                                   |
| 52:06      | It can be a fun way to procrastinate but at the same time then you have something that                 |
| 52:09      | can make your life easier while you're working on big life changes and I definitely see that           |
| 52:15      | as a win.                                                                                              |
| 52:18      | I've actually used charting to create a point chart of Relay FM episode durations in the              |
| 52:25      | past.                                                                                                  |
| 52:26      | I've already showed it to you guys, the automators one, but I've built one to track like 5 different   |
| 52:37      | shows.                                                                                                 |
| 52:38      | It gets data from adapts, automators, connected, cortex, and under the radar.                          |
| 52:44      | You won't believe it but the guys under the radar are really sticking to their 30 minute               |
| 52:50      | room.                                                                                                  |
| 52:51      | Most episodes don't last 29 minutes.                                                                   |
| 52:54      | Have you tried checking clockwise because I hear sometimes they go to like 30 minutes                  |
| 52:59      | in 10 seconds.                                                                                         |
| 53:00      | Yeah, I haven't checked it.                                                                            |
| 53:05      | And so to do that, what you're just hitting the website, where are you getting your data               |
| 53:09      | source from?                                                                                           |
| 53:10      | Yes, I'm hitting the Relay FM website and I have a list of the five names.                            |
| 53:15      | It's actually the short name that you guys use for the URL of the show and I have a base               |
| 53:21      | URL that just Relay FM shows the show I want.                                                         |
| 53:26      | So I repeat it.                                                                                        |
| 53:27      | I'm only getting the first two pages because ADAPT has only less than 30 episodes.                     |
| 53:35      | So I wanted to get 20, the last 20 episodes for each one of these shows.                               |
| 53:40      | And then I use the get constant of URL action and I use regular expressions to extract the             |
| 53:48      | duration you guys add to reach entry.                                                                  |
| 53:51      | And then I put this into charts.                                                                       |
| 53:57      | I can chart this with you also.                                                                        |
| 53:59      | So you can put it in the show notes.                                                                   |
| 54:02      | Did you consider using the RSS feeds for these, by the way, just out of curiosity?                     |
| 54:06      | No, I hadn't tried this, but this might work also.                                                     |
| 54:12      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 54:13      | I'm just wondering because every podcast behind every podcast episode, there is an RSS feed.           |
| 54:19      | That's how it all works.                                                                               |
| 54:20      | But I don't think, and somebody's going to tell me that I'm wrong here and then I'll                   |
| 54:24      | be very happy, I don't think that the RSS feed actions inside of shortcuts allow you                   |
| 54:29      | to access the duration of a podcast episode.                                                           |
| 54:31      | I think it's purely designed for standard feed reading, which is kind of a shame because               |
| 54:36      | it could potentially make this a little easier for you.                                                |
| 54:39      | No regular expressions required.                                                                       |
| 54:41      | But it's a fairly simple regular expressions.                                                          |
| 54:45      | Just looks for a number followed by the word minutes and then extracts the number and uses             |
| 54:50      | it as the values for the series.                                                                       |
| 54:54      | Yeah, that would work.                                                                                 |
| 54:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 54:57      | I'm looking at it now.                                                                                 |
| 54:58      | So just only one episode of under the radar that's below the line of 30 minutes, and it's              |
| 55:04      | one that for some reason, the duration in the website is set to zero.                                  |
| 55:12      | So I guess someone forgot you to update it or just missing three.                                      |
| 55:17      | It's interesting because you make these things and you put them out in the world and then              |
| 55:20      | you hear how people are using them to create stuff and it's got to feel good with the way              |
| 55:26      | it is.                                                                                                 |
| 55:29      | Yeah, it's very fulfilling to see how people are using and how it's bringing value to their            |
| 55:37      | workflows.                                                                                             |
| 55:39      | So it's very nice to see.                                                                              |
| 55:42      | The one from the Omni wiki shortcut that I released, one on the beta that just scours the OmniFocus      |
| 55:54      | database and gets the completed tasks for the last week and shows you a nice bar chart                 |
| 56:01      | of how much tasks you've completed today.                                                              |
| 56:06      | I tweeted it on a Saturday, I guess, I was watching something in the television and then               |
| 56:14      | I got a notification saying 10Ks had retweeted it and I almost fell from the sofa when I               |
| 56:21      | started.                                                                                               |
| 56:22      | Well, that's kind of full circle because we talked about it on the show and you created                |
| 56:26      | it and then Ken has found it.                                                                          |
| 56:27      | So that's awesome.                                                                                     |
| 56:29      | And it's like you've added a featured OmniFocus, you know, I love that.                                |
| 56:34      | Yeah, it's great.                                                                                      |
| 56:36      | I was hearing the last episode here when he was talking to you guys and it's just like                 |
| 56:42      | he said, they gave us the way to extract data from OmniFocus so we can do whatever we want             |
| 56:50      | with it.                                                                                               |
| 56:51      | So making charts was the easy answer to that.                                                          |
| 56:56      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 56:57      | And I feel that that's one of the things that automation really does allow you to do.                  |
| 57:01      | It allows even a user who's not a programmer like you or me to go ahead and make their                 |
| 57:07      | own applications because that's what you're doing.                                                     |
| 57:11      | If you're building an automation, even if you don't feel like it, you're a programmer.                 |
| 57:15      | Yes, about different users, the users had with charting, there was this one user recently,             |
| 57:22      | it was last week, I guess, that was unsatisfied with all the apps that he's using to track             |
| 57:31      | his keto diet.                                                                                         |
| 57:33      | And then he created a shortcut with data charting and charting that he allows him to track everything. |
| 57:40      | He's been tracking glucose ketones in ketosis and lots of things that I don't understand               |
| 57:46      | about the keto diet, but he's been generating very nice charts with it.                                |
| 57:52      | Could you share a link with us, please, so that we can add that to the show notes because              |
| 57:56      | I am sure a lot of our users are going to be really interested in just seeing how that                 |
| 58:01      | is done.                                                                                               |
| 58:02      | And I know, especially recently, spending a lot of time at home, I realised that I am                  |
| 58:07      | most definitely eating more chocolate than is good for me, so I'm feeling that I may                   |
| 58:11      | need a chocolate tracking shortcut, which I suspect will be a little less complex than                 |
| 58:16      | the book tracking shortcut, but perhaps a little more complex than the standard every                  |
| 58:23      | day.                                                                                                   |
| 58:24      | How much did I sleep?                                                                                  |
| 58:25      | Because that's ultimately tracked by my Apple Watch and the Health App.                                |
| 58:28      | I just need to know, Rose, in your mind, does American chocolate even qualify as chocolate             |
| 58:33      | and your chocolate tracking list?                                                                      |
| 58:35      | That's a nice question.                                                                                |
| 58:36      | I have to be very careful here because when I went to Mac Stock last year and I was hanging            |
| 58:43      | up with you and Mac Schmidt's and Mac's lovely wife, and we went to a really nice chocolate            |
| 58:49      | place somewhere near Woodstock, they had really nice chocolate, but I have to say the chocolate        |
| 58:56      | that I have seen in American grocery stores and I once made the mistake of purchasing,                 |
| 59:02      | I was really not very pleased with it and I did not enjoy it.                                          |
| 59:06      | Now, I probably didn't pick great chocolate to be fair because I'm used to just being                  |
| 59:10      | able to buy cheap stuff in the supermarket over here and it's pretty good, but yeah,                   |
| 59:15      | I was disappointed by the supermarket stuff, but impressed by the fancy chocolate place                |
| 59:20      | and it was tasty and delicious.                                                                        |
| 59:21      | I'll agree with you there.                                                                             |
| 59:22      | I mean, some of the stuff you get in the stores here is barely chocolate, but all right.               |
| 59:28      | But that's, I think you need to address that in your app, your shortcut slash Charty app.             |
| 59:32      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 59:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:34      | I don't have the link for this key to that shortcuts yet, but I'll send you the link                   |
| 59:39      | to the tweet that Gabriel created.                                                                     |
| 59:43      | I do think that if I were to make that chocolate app, I would also track my mood because I             |
| 59:48      | know that I'm like Harry Potter when I feel sad, chocolate helps me, so I bet we would                 |
| 59:55      | see some interesting data on that Charty graph.                                                       |
| 59:57      | Oh, I'm sure we will.                                                                                  |
| 59:59      | And they've just added a tracking to the health app with a recent beta.                                |
| 01:00:04   | So the 13.6 beta two has just added some extra symptom tracking, which includes mood changes.          |
| 01:00:11   | I wonder if there's actual mood in there.                                                              |
| 01:00:13   | If not, I may need a mood tracking shortcut and a chocolate tracking shortcut and then                 |
| 01:00:16   | a shortcut that allows me to track both at the same time and then compares the data at                 |
| 01:00:21   | the end of the day.                                                                                    |
| 01:00:22   | I didn't know about the wood tracking in health.                                                       |
| 01:00:25   | It's nice to know this because it gives us a standardised way to track the mood and tracking           |
| 01:00:33   | data with health is easier to chart it with Charty.                                                   |
| 01:00:39   | With just two actions, you can extract the data from health and plot it directly to chart.             |
| 01:00:44   | It does appear that the moment you're only tracking mood changes and the options are                   |
| 01:00:48   | present and not present, but of course, this is of course still an early beta, so we may               |
| 01:00:55   | see more changes there.                                                                                |
| 01:00:56   | If not, data to my rescue.                                                                             |
| 01:00:58   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:00:59   | Definitely.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:00   | And it's interesting because this is the show comes out the last business day before                   |
| 01:01:05   | WWDC.                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:06   | And so it's my last chance to wish cast.                                                               |
| 01:01:08   | But wouldn't it be great if we can also track our time data the way we can track our health            |
| 01:01:12   | data?                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:13   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 01:01:14   | It makes some really cool charts too.                                                                  |
| 01:01:16   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:01:17   | I'd love to have access to that data.                                                                  |
| 01:01:19   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:01:21   | Well, either way, congratulations on getting your app out.                                             |
| 01:01:24   | I'm so happy that it's successful and there are a lot of people using it.                              |
| 01:01:27   | We didn't mention, but in the Automators Forum, we have created a sub-forum for Charty,               |
| 01:01:34   | just like we've done for some of the other third-party apps.                                           |
| 01:01:36   | So welcome to the forums and you can find that over at automators.fm.                                  |
| 01:01:42   | Thanks for that.                                                                                       |
| 01:01:43   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:01:44   | I was really happy to get my own forum in the other ways for it.                                       |
| 01:01:48   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:49   | And check it out.                                                                                      |
| 01:01:50   | You can talk with other people using Charty and kind of share scripts.                                |
| 01:01:52   | Rodrigo has been very helpful with helping us, sharing some of the shortcuts we've talked              |
| 01:01:57   | about today so you can download those and start playing with them and modifying them                   |
| 01:02:00   | for your own use.                                                                                      |
| 01:02:01   | We are the Automators.                                                                                 |
| 01:02:02   | You can find us over at relay.fm/automators.                                                     |
| 01:02:06   | Anything big going on recently, Rose, that you should share with our listeners?                        |
| 01:02:11   | Not just yet.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:12   | I think we will have some bigger stuff to share post WWDC, but let's see what happens.                 |
| 01:02:17   | Yeah, we are both looking forward to WWDC and the automation story as it continues.                    |
| 01:02:23   | Hopefully, shortcuts continues to get love.                                                            |
| 01:02:27   | We're always curious about the future of shortcuts.                                                    |
| 01:02:30   | Is it going to become more complex or more simple or are they going to, you know, what's               |
| 01:02:34   | going to happen next?                                                                                  |
| 01:02:35   | We don't know.                                                                                         |
| 01:02:36   | We'll find out.                                                                                        |
| 01:02:37   | And Rodrigo, where can people find you?                                                                |
| 01:02:40   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:41   | Thanks guys.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:42   | Thanks for having me in the show.                                                                      |
| 01:02:43   | It was great talking to you.                                                                           |
| 01:02:44   | I met Rodrigo RaÃºjo, like the episode name, at Twitter, and also at Charty iOS in Twitter.            |

| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the productivity podcast, which is more about automating than          |
| 00:07      | it is about productivity. But let's hope that we can use all of these tips and tricks to                 |
| 00:11      | get everything done in record time so that we can go and slack off later. I'm Rosemary                   |
| 00:15      | Orchard and joined by David Sparks. Hi, David. How are you today?                                        |
| 00:18      | Hi, Rosemary. What an introduction. It includes slacking. I'm in.                                        |
| 00:23      | Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the point of all this, isn't it? We do things quickly                 |
| 00:28      | and efficiently, so then we can just have fun the rest of the time. And I'm sure today's guest           |
| 00:33      | is going to agree with us on that one. Welcome to the show, Kelly Guimont.                                |
| 00:37      | Hi. I'm really excited to be back. Yeah. It's always fun to talk to you about automation,                |
| 00:42      | and then you've got a lot of stuff going on. And we have a lot in the Outline to cover today.            |
| 00:49      | But for folks who don't know you, Kelly, tell us a little bit about you.                                 |
| 00:52      | Well, I am on a lot of podcasts. I do the Mac Observer Daily Observations podcast five days              |
| 01:01      | a week. And the rest of the time, I have my own show over on the incomparable network called             |
| 01:06      | I Want My MCU TV, where we talk about the latest Marvel show that's streaming on Disney Plus.            |
| 01:12      | I do that with Lisa Schmeiser and Don Melton. And it's a whole lot of fun. I occasionally                |
| 01:20      | pop up on other podcasts there as well. We've talked about, I've done a few episodes of Football         |
| 01:24      | Is Life, which is the Ted Lasso podcast over there, and a few other things as stuff pops up              |
| 01:32      | that is something that I want to discuss. I also have the after show, which is a show I host with        |
| 01:38      | Mike Rose, when we can get together and record, we put out episodes of that. And the rest of the         |
| 01:44      | time, my day job is part of operations management at a company called Technolutionary. And we do         |
| 01:53      | IT for small and medium businesses, so managed service providing sorts of things.                        |
| 02:01      | Well, I don't think you can be called a slacker.                                                         |
| 02:04      | It's a lot of different things.                                                                          |
| 02:05      | It's too busy.                                                                                           |
| 02:07      | Yeah. Every once in a while, the stars will align and I will get an entire day off.                      |
| 02:12      | And those are good days indeed.                                                                          |
| 02:16      | You know, you have a podcast about Ted Lasso. I caught myself in that spot where                         |
| 02:22      | everybody I met, I was telling to watch Ted Lasso and I realised I was turning into that guy.            |
| 02:28      | So I actually made a rule that I'm only allowed to recommend it twice a week now.                        |
| 02:34      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 02:34      | How are you keeping track of this, David? Is there a shortcut at both?                                   |
| 02:37      | I don't know, but I feel like if I recommended on the podcast,                                           |
| 02:41      | I've used up all of my Ted Lasso recommendations for a long time.                                        |
| 02:44      | Perhaps.                                                                                                 |
| 02:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 02:46      | Possibly. Possibly.                                                                                      |
| 02:48      | But Kelly, you are a very busy person. I know you and I have been friends for a long time.               |
| 02:55      | I remember us meeting back at Macworld, back when there was a Macworld.                                  |
| 02:59      | But you are also a very tech-savvy person, particularly when it comes to [[Apple]] hardware.                 |
| 03:05      | And I know that you do a lot of automation stuff, but I don't know how you got started in it.            |
| 03:12      | What led you down the garden path of automation?                                                         |
| 03:18      | Well, it was sort of a one-two punch.                                                                    |
| 03:22      | So I live in Portland and before Apple stores, [[Apple]] retail stores were a common site.                   |
| 03:30      | Most of the time, if you wanted sort of that retail experience,                                          |
| 03:33      | but to have it be around [[Apple]] products, you had to have an [[Apple]] authorised reseller                    |
| 03:39      | where you were that had a storefront that you could actually go to.                                      |
| 03:43      | And there was one here that was called MacForce.                                                         |
| 03:45      | They're still here, but they don't look quite the same as they used to.                                  |
| 03:49      | They don't have the retail storefront anymore.                                                           |
| 03:51      | And they were a place that I went all the time.                                                          |
| 03:54      | They used to have OS release parties.                                                                    |
| 03:57      | And so when the new version of Mac OS came out,                                                          |
| 03:59      | you could go and hang out with people and I'll get your nerd on.                                         |
| 04:03      | And it was pretty great.                                                                                 |
| 04:04      | And every summer, they used to have a barbecue called the Summer Blast.                                  |
| 04:09      | And we would go and they would have coupons for ice cream and you could get a hamburger.                 |
| 04:16      | And there were all these booths of software vendors and things.                                          |
| 04:19      | And I was there for a company that I was working for at the time.                                        |
| 04:23      | And I ended up sitting next to Jean McDonald, who was there for Smile Software.                          |
| 04:27      | And we got to talking and she gave me a license for TextExpander.                                        |
| 04:33      | And that was it.                                                                                         |
| 04:35      | So that was where I started was because I sat next to Jean who went,                                     |
| 04:41      | well, with TextExpander, you type something small and it gives you all the text that you                 |
| 04:46      | decide you want that to be.                                                                              |
| 04:47      | So you should try it out.                                                                                |
| 04:48      | Here's a license.                                                                                        |
| 04:49      | And I was in tech support at the time.                                                                   |
| 04:52      | And so having something where it was going to be very easy to send the 20 emails that I                  |
| 04:58      | have to send out multiple times every day, making that much easier and much more consistent              |
| 05:04      | every time was really, really nice.                                                                      |
| 05:06      | So that TextExpander, it was very much that first ones free kind of situation.                           |
| 05:13      | So yeah, well, it really is a gateway drug for a lot of people.                                          |
| 05:17      | And for some people, that's the end of the road.                                                         |
| 05:22      | You use TextExpander, you get good at it.                                                                |
| 05:23      | And like if you're in customer support, that's really the best tool you could own.                       |
| 05:29      | And maybe that's all you need.                                                                           |
| 05:31      | But there's so much more you can do.                                                                     |
| 05:33      | That's why we make the show.                                                                             |
| 05:34      | We want you to come further down the rabbit hole with us.                                                |
| 05:37      | But no, I think that TextExpander is a starting point for a lot of folks.                                |
| 05:42      | And it was so helpful, because one of the things that I really appreciated about it was                  |
| 05:48      | knowing these are the emails that I send out all the time and instead of having a much                   |
| 05:52      | nicer way to go about it than having to have a Word document open all the time and scroll                |
| 05:58      | down to the one I actually want to use, that I wrote really nicely one time and having                   |
| 06:04      | to scroll through this giant wall of text in order to find the piece that is the answer                  |
| 06:09      | to this person's question or whatever.                                                                   |
| 06:10      | And so having a much more efficient way to do that and be able to be effective at it                     |
| 06:15      | was really, really nice.                                                                                 |
| 06:16      | That Word document is giving me tech support flashback nightmares.                                       |
| 06:20      | Oh my gosh, we used to have one of those.                                                                |
| 06:21      | Hated it.                                                                                                |
| 06:22      | Hated it.                                                                                                |
| 06:23      | I think everybody does at some point, or there's like a web page internally or something                 |
| 06:28      | where just the list of all the stuff is that you're supposed to have.                                    |
| 06:31      | And it's hard.                                                                                           |
| 06:33      | It's not easy to use that.                                                                               |
| 06:34      | It's not an elegant solution.                                                                            |
| 06:36      | And it's no fun to have to try and utilise it.                                                           |
| 06:40      | And it ends up being less efficient over time.                                                           |
| 06:43      | Like I could have typed this response the amount of time it takes me to find it in that                  |
| 06:46      | Word document.                                                                                           |
| 06:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 06:48      | Yeah, I think anytime you leave your app for text expansion, you've already lost.                        |
| 06:52      | You know, it has to happen just right there, in my opinion.                                              |
| 06:57      | But now I happen to know that you're at this point, you are no longer a TextExpander newbie             |
| 07:03      | but a TextExpander power user, you know.                                                                |
| 07:06      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 07:07      | Drop some knowledge on us for folks out there who are using TextExpander or thinking about              |
| 07:12      | it.                                                                                                      |
| 07:12      | What are some of the tricks you've picked up over the years?                                             |
| 07:16      | First is, well, some inspiration I got from you, David, actually, when TextExpander for                 |
| 07:26      | iOS was released, a lot of people, because it was a good example at the time when it                     |
| 07:31      | was only on the Mac, their shortcuts start with a semicolon, because a semicolon, like                   |
| 07:39      | if you're actually meaning to type a semicolon, there's never characters after it.                       |
| 07:42      | So it makes a good way to start a snippet shortcut.                                                      |
| 07:47      | And so you changed yours.                                                                                |
| 07:48      | I don't remember if it was like, you know, XX or something like that.                                    |
| 07:51      | But I changed mine as well to mine, the ones I know I'm going to use on mobile start with                |
| 07:57      | QQ, because I know that's always going to be on and I don't ever type anything with                      |
| 08:02      | two Qs next to each other.                                                                               |
| 08:03      | Yeah, because when you're on a Mac, the semicolon is under your pinkie.                                   |
| 08:06      | So that's a great starting character for a snippet.                                                      |
| 08:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 08:10      | I mean, the idea is you don't want your snippets to conflict with actual words.                          |
| 08:14      | So you need usually put something weird at the beginning.                                                |
| 08:16      | Like if you put semicolon cell, you're not going to write cell phone by with a semicolon                 |
| 08:22      | at the beginning, unless you're trying to do a snippet, but we all did that for years.                   |
| 08:26      | And then the iPhone showed up and they put the semicolon on a separate keyboard.                         |
| 08:30      | So all of a sudden, it was so easy to hit semicolon and run a snippet.                                   |
| 08:34      | But then you're on an iPad and you've got to literally switch keyboards to get the                       |
| 08:39      | semicolon.                                                                                               |
| 08:40      | So I changed mine to X. So like X C E L L instead of semicolon C E L L.                                  |
| 08:45      | And it took like a half hour to go through and switch them all.                                          |
| 08:48      | But I had published about that early because if you're going to do it on an iPad or an                   |
| 08:52      | iPhone, you do not want to have to switch keyboards.                                                     |
| 08:55      | Yeah, that's a good tip.                                                                                 |
| 08:56      | Yeah, that's one.                                                                                        |
| 08:57      | And it's the kind of thing I think sometimes doesn't get like, you don't stop and think                  |
| 09:02      | about it because muscle memory just means you've been doing, you know, you've been hitting               |
| 09:06      | semicolon for five years or 10 years or whatever.                                                        |
| 09:08      | And so it makes it, you know, it never occurs to you like, what if that was something else?              |
| 09:12      | So that would be one of mine.                                                                            |
| 09:15      | Another of mine is fill ins.                                                                             |
| 09:18      | And if there's something that you can do that has generally it's going to be this thing,                 |
| 09:28      | but maybe sometimes it needs to be changed using a fill in for that.                                     |
| 09:32      | So like, yes, I want to send it the default way this time.                                               |
| 09:36      | Or maybe you have like a little, you know, a different thing you need to change.                         |
| 09:40      | My prime example of this one is we get automated alerts from all of the machines that I manage           |
| 09:46      | at work.                                                                                                 |
| 09:47      | And so we get automated alerts about the hard drive is this percent full.                                |
| 09:53      | And so I have an automated snippet for that email that says you need to clear up this                    |
| 10:00      | many gigabytes of space.                                                                                 |
| 10:02      | And usually it's like five.                                                                              |
| 10:04      | So I have a default value in there of five.                                                              |
| 10:06      | So when I expand the snippet, it comes out and it automatically fills in five and I can                  |
| 10:11      | leave it like that, or I can go actually for this person, you know, it's 10 or it's 30 or                |
| 10:14      | whatever.                                                                                                |
| 10:14      | And then I can change it if I need to, but I have a value for most of the time,                          |
| 10:20      | which makes it a very easy thing to configure and send.                                                  |
| 10:23      | And then the clipboard, anything you have with the clipboard would be the other pro                      |
| 10:29      | tip I can give people make sure like if there's something where you need to copy and paste               |
| 10:35      | something into something else, see if there's a way to use the clipboard for that.                       |
| 10:40      | Because the clip, automatically inserting the clipboard as part of different snippets                    |
| 10:46      | makes it really, really easy to do and build something useful.                                           |
| 10:50      | Amen.                                                                                                    |
| 10:51      | Yeah, the clipboard and the fill ins is our awesome tools and it makes you feel almost                   |
| 10:56      | like you're a programmer, right?                                                                         |
| 10:57      | You feel very fancy when you start doing those fill ins.                                                 |
| 11:00      | Yeah, particularly you add a pop up menu to something and it works, you know, or letting                 |
| 11:07      | TextExpander do the date math for you, like part of what I like about it is if you set                   |
| 11:13      | up something like that once, like you could be done, you know, as long as you're effective               |
| 11:18      | at it the one time, then, you know, then then you're solid.                                              |
| 11:22      | So like I think probably my honestly my number one tax expander snippet is probably the one              |
| 11:29      | I have that is PCB, which is plain clipboard.                                                            |
| 11:32      | And so it's a plain text snippet and it's the contents of my clipboard.                                  |
| 11:36      | And that's I use that constantly throughout the day because I never want whatever the                    |
| 11:41      | formatting is that was part of where it came from or where it's going.                                   |
| 11:45      | I don't want to break any of it.                                                                         |
| 11:47      | So here just have some nice ordinary text that I pasted that I copied from wherever                      |
| 11:52      | and it doesn't matter because that plain clipboard snippet clears it up.                                 |
| 11:55      | Yeah, if you've ever like copied something from the web and then try to paste it into a document,        |
| 12:01      | you have had this experience of like suddenly it's a bizarre font with hyperlinks                        |
| 12:06      | and a bunch of other strange coding in it.                                                               |
| 12:08      | And like your document looks crazy.                                                                      |
| 12:11      | And this plain clipboard all it strips all of that out and just gets plain text.                         |
| 12:16      | And I agree that that should like come on the box for a tax expander.                                    |
| 12:22      | That one, you know, it should be like right on the box.                                                  |
| 12:24      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 12:24      | Not that we buy boxes anymore, but you know what I mean.                                                 |
| 12:27      | It should be part of the setup, you know, like the one where, you know, give us give us your             |
| 12:33      | name and give us your email address, you know, and set those up or like the date, you know,              |
| 12:37      | the sort of prefab snippets that definitely would be one.                                                |
| 12:41      | And I also like it for small words.                                                                      |
| 12:44      | Like people like, I love TextExpander for my, you know, here's the five paragraphs of whatever          |
| 12:49      | it is, you know, and I typed five characters to spit all of that out.                                    |
| 12:53      | But also like if the word, if there's a word you type a lot that is sometimes open to interpretation,    |
| 13:02      | if you're typing really quickly, sometimes those are really good snippets too.                           |
| 13:08      | Like I spell the word version wrong a lot because I just do.                                             |
| 13:14      | And so I have a snippet for when I type it wrong to automatically just correct it for                    |
| 13:19      | me that one word and then I don't have to go back for it.                                                |
| 13:21      | I do the same thing with separate because the other thing is that sometimes I don't                      |
| 13:25      | remember if it's the A or the E and what is it that I'm doing here and wait, what was I writing?         |
| 13:30      | And so now I've just, I've got it set up so that that's it.                                              |
| 13:34      | It just comes out the right way every single time.                                                       |
| 13:36      | And, you know, it's that sort of thing as well that shows, you know,                                     |
| 13:40      | that you're putting effort into your work, not having typos like that in there.                          |
| 13:44      | So cleaning those up, you know, it makes you feel good as well,                                          |
| 13:47      | just knowing that they don't happen anymore.                                                             |
| 13:50      | Yeah, proper names are another good one.                                                                 |
| 13:52      | Like if you have somebody has a strange spelling for their name.                                         |
| 13:56      | The last thing you want to do is send somebody correspondence and misspell their name.                   |
| 14:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 14:01      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 14:01      | I actually, once I sent a, there was a judge whose name was Jackman.                                     |
| 14:08      | And I, his first name wasn't Hugh, but I wrote a brief and sent it to him as Hugh Jackman.               |
| 14:15      | And I don't know why in my head, I made his first name Hugh Jackman.                                     |
| 14:20      | And then I showed up for the oral argument and he said,                                                  |
| 14:23      | Mr. Sparks, I just want you to know that I really appreciate how handsome you think I am                 |
| 14:27      | that you would confuse me with Hugh Jackman. And I just turned like five shades of red and open cord.    |
| 14:34      | TextExpander could have helped me that day.                                                             |
| 14:35      | At least he took it well.                                                                                |
| 14:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 14:36      | At least he took it well.                                                                                |
| 14:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 14:38      | After he retired, I talked to him about it. He thought it was funny.                                     |
| 14:41      | But the, you know, the err TextExpander could have helped me that day, I think.                             |
| 14:46      | Kelly, something else you told me you do with TextExpander that I don't think we really talk            |
| 14:50      | about enough is you said you use it a lot on mobile. And I think a lot of folks use it primarily         |
| 14:56      | on Mac. And could you talk about the experience on mobile and some of the tricks you use for that?       |
| 15:01      | Yeah. So this comes from, interestingly enough, this comes from my husband                               |
| 15:07      | who is known in podcast circles as Mr. Kelly, because I used to work at full disclosure.                 |
| 15:14      | I did work for a time at Smile Software doing TextExpander technical support.                           |
| 15:20      | So I had, obviously, I had access to it. I'm a huge fan. I was a huge fan before I started working       |
| 15:26      | there. But I got Mr. Kelly all set up with it. And he was using it for something or somebody asked       |
| 15:34      | him about like an app on his phone. And it was, it was TextExpander they were asking about.             |
| 15:38      | And he said, you know how when you fill out stuff on your phone, it's really easy to get your email      |
| 15:43      | address wrong. What if you could fix that was what he said to this person? Oh, my God, that's            |
| 15:51      | exactly what the mobile, like the mobile experience needs is like being able to type something on        |
| 15:58      | your phone and know it's correct and not having to rely on auto correct to make sure of that.            |
| 16:05      | So that's the thing that I like it for. And again, I like it for very small things.                      |
| 16:08      | Email addresses, because I don't have all of them in contacts. And so they're not always                 |
| 16:13      | auto suggested to me, like I want them to be. And sometimes the web page doesn't know any better.        |
| 16:18      | So like, [[Safari]] can't tell that it's something that wants contact information. So I don't always         |
| 16:23      | even get the option to fill in that field with an email address. So being able to have something         |
| 16:28      | like that where my email address is easily enterable correctly. And I know it's right,                   |
| 16:35      | even though I didn't type it because I typed it right once, when I set it up in TextExpander,           |
| 16:39      | so as long as I know what snippet I need, I can do it that way very quickly.                             |
| 16:45      | I also like it for small things that I put in emails. So if I'm trying to reply to somebody              |
| 16:52      | right away, I need to talk to that, you know, you can give me a call at and, you know, have              |
| 16:57      | my phone number in there. And I know I've typed it right, being able to use it, because I do a           |
| 17:03      | fair amount of stuff on mobile. So not just on my phone, but also on my iPad, like triageing email,       |
| 17:08      | or I just need to tell somebody okay, or something like that. I have some, some automated replies        |
| 17:15      | that I can use for some of that. And I very much appreciate it in that respect. And because there's      |
| 17:21      | there's not a lot of formatting I have to worry about. So that my clipboard snippets don't get           |
| 17:25      | quite the mileage on my, my phone or my iPad, but anything where I need to fill in an email address,     |
| 17:32      | or my shipping information, or other little small quotes like that sounds good, I'll talk to you         |
| 17:40      | then, you know, or, or little things like that that I can use that are that are easy to make sure        |
| 17:45      | that I'm still communicating with people effectively. So I use them for that stuff. And then             |
| 17:51      | small fun things like my [[Nintendo Switch]] friend code I have as a TextExpander snippet, and my           |
| 17:56      | Pokemon go friend code I have as a TextExpander snippet, so that it's easy to share them with           |
| 18:01      | other people. And then, and I know I got it correct. And I don't have to go through all the              |
| 18:06      | hassle of copying out and pasting it somewhere else every time. So yeah, yeah, no, the forms that        |
| 18:11      | don't correctly identify the fields within them are one of the those things that just end up             |
| 18:18      | aggravating everybody, but especially on mobile, because iOS, you know, nowadays is much better          |
| 18:23      | about suggesting your contact information, assuming it's got it, for all of these things. But it         |
| 18:28      | it can't do it if it doesn't know that the field that you're typing into is an email field, or           |
| 18:33      | something. I have one recently, I was trying to sign up for something, neither the email field nor       |
| 18:38      | the password field were marked as such. So iOS just couldn't suggest that I use 1Password for and     |
| 18:44      | actually the 1Password [[Safari]] extension wasn't working either. And so yeah, I ended up split          |
| 18:50      | screening on my iPad to deal with that, which was not great. But at the very least, you know, I could    |
| 18:56      | use my expansions to type in my email address, I just needed to use 1Password to generate the         |
| 19:01      | password. Kelly, how do you trigger your snippets on mobile? A lot of people don't know how to do        |
| 19:08      | that. Well, you can switch to the keyboard. And so I this is one of those times where I have             |
| 19:17      | I have basically overthought something to the ultimate degree. I have gone in and reordered              |
| 19:25      | my keyboards such that the TextExpander keyboard is the one at the bottom of the list. So when I        |
| 19:32      | press down on the globe, I just slide my thumb up a tiny bit and automatically and then when I let go    |
| 19:38      | on the TextExpander keyboard, it switches to it automatically. And then if you just tap on it,          |
| 19:43      | I think it takes you back to the default automatically because the top keyboard on my list is the        |
| 19:48      | default English keyboard. So if I if I hold on the globe and slide up to the TextExpander               |
| 19:55      | keyboard, I can type my snippets and do what I need to do and then just tap the globe a second           |
| 20:00      | time and it takes me back to English. And so that's how I'm able to flip between them really easily      |
| 20:06      | because I do things like reorder all my keyboards so that the menu looks how I want it. Kelly,           |
| 20:12      | you think that means you overthink things and that just tells me that you are my kind of nerd.           |
| 20:18      | Well, let me tell you a story about how I've laid out all the apps on my home screen based on which      |
| 20:22      | hand my my I hold my phone in for that particular activity. All right, we got to go there. Okay,         |
| 20:28      | let's hear it. You're going to tell us now you open Pandora's box. You got to give us the answer.        |
| 20:32      | Well, all right. So in when I occasionally drive places, I usually want to use maps. And if I want       |
| 20:43      | to use maps, so what I normally what I do, I don't have to worry about lots of traffic for the most      |
| 20:50      | part. So I just want to sort of glance at it and go, you know, I know how to get where I'm going.        |
| 20:55      | Is there an accident or is there construction I don't know about. And so I just want to look             |
| 20:59      | at maps really quick. So with my phone in my right hand, the place to have maps is on the bottom row,    |
| 21:06      | not the furthest right icon, but the next to the the, it would be the third in a row of four             |
| 21:12      | across the screen. So that when I hold my phone, I'm a pinkie perch person. So when I hold my phone       |
| 21:17      | in my right hand, that's where maps is the thing I want the easiest access to. So it sits on the         |
| 21:22      | right hand side of the screen. So because most of the time my phone lives in my left hand,               |
| 21:27      | because I am left handed, then I have messages and music and my home apps in the dock                    |
| 21:34      | from left to right so that I can access the things that I need most of the time,                         |
| 21:39      | the easiest by having them in the dock so that they're there on any page. But then the stuff             |
| 21:44      | that I use the most is going to be in the lower left hand corner of any page because that's where        |
| 21:50      | my thumb goes. That makes sense. I get it. Yeah. I mean, have you experimented with the focus modes      |
| 21:59      | and changing your your home screen so that you end up with different things based on different,          |
| 22:04      | you know, I don't know, times a day or something. So for example, during the work focus mode,            |
| 22:08      | you've got different things. Because I imagine that tied with your actual thinking about where           |
| 22:13      | all these apps belong on your on your home screen, you know, in depth would really possibly              |
| 22:18      | boost your productivity there. I've dabbled in focus modes. I haven't spent a bunch of time yet.         |
| 22:25      | But also I have a separate work phone and a separate work computer. So I don't have. So                  |
| 22:30      | generally, like my work focus is I just don't have stuff on on my phone.                                 |
| 22:38      | It's mostly do not disturb or not for the most part when I when I'm doing stuff like that.               |
| 22:44      | But I'm looking at how I can make those more effective because I do I would like to make                 |
| 22:50      | sure that I have a podcasting focus mode set up so that none of my devices make noise if I don't         |
| 22:56      | want them to and have that be an easy thing to fix. So and as opposed to just do not disturb.            |
| 23:02      | Yeah. So yeah, I have a podcasting focus mode and it's enabled right now, which is fabulous.             |
| 23:07      | Turns out that my automation to enable that automatically at times for podcasting is working.            |
| 23:12      | So I'm quite pleased about that. But yeah, that like that, that's the sort of thing where I think        |
| 23:19      | people don't necessarily think about it. And it's not necessarily actually automation in that sense      |
| 23:24      | of, you know, you're not having the app automatically open when you think about the word maps.           |
| 23:30      | That would be pretty cool, possibly also a little creepy. But, you know, you know,                       |
| 23:35      | by putting it in the place where it's easy to reach, you know, that makes a little sense.                |
| 23:40      | Have you ever done that thing where you've downloaded an app that replaces another app,                  |
| 23:44      | and then you put it in the same spot so that you you start hitting that one instead?                     |
| 23:49      | Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I've also done like this lives in the dock for a while or this lives on       |
| 23:56      | the first page for a while just so that it's a thing that I see all the time so that I remember          |
| 24:01      | that it's the thing I'm supposed to be tapping on instead of whatever I was using before. So yeah,       |
| 24:06      | I've definitely done that. The I know what I know what's supposed to live there. So I'm just going       |
| 24:11      | to keep hitting that. And it's a different different app than it was before or something.                |
| 24:14      | But I know it's that spot. So yeah. Yeah. That's how I trained myself out of using [[Instagram]] so          |
| 24:18      | much. I put all me focus in its place. And bam, I'm getting a lot more done.                             |
| 24:25      | Rose, we're going to do a future episode just breaking down all of our focus modes because               |
| 24:30      | I'm using all 10. And I think we got a show there. Let's do that one day. Oh, I'm sure we do.            |
| 24:35      | I'm sure we do. There are several. Yeah, there's so many uses.                                           |

| 26:28      | one that is completely selfish for me. You make a few podcasts as you had said earlier, but you          |
| 26:37      | have a set of [[Keyboard Maestro]] scripts that you have generated to help you in that process.              |
| 26:42      | I understand that everybody listening in the audience is making a podcast, but hopefully                 |
| 26:46      | the idea is Kelly's about to share can help you figure out some for whatever it is you do,               |
| 26:52      | and what she's about to share will definitely help me. So here we go. Tell me about your                 |
| 26:58      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] podcasting short automations. Okay, so there's a little bit to it, and mostly           |
| 27:09      | it's using [[Keyboard Maestro]] for timestamps for a lot of things. So I got a set of [[Keyboard Maestro]]       |
| 27:20      | macros from Dave Hamilton, who does Mac Geek Gab. He does the small business show gig gab                  |
| 27:27      | and shows up on daily observations with me sometimes over at Mac observer. And so he had he              |
| 27:34      | put together this library of [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros. And part of what they do is make it so             |
| 27:44      | that when so you can be capturing, but then when you actually hit record, it resets the clock on         |
| 27:51      | [[Audio Hijack]] back to zero on your session. So that and then once you do that, and like for me,           |
| 27:59      | for example, the one that I do, it resets everything to zero. And then it invokes Farrago                 |
| 28:06      | Farrago from audio also from from [[Rogue Amoeba]] to play the intro theme music for daily observations.          |
| 28:14      | And then I have a plain text file. And when we switch topics, I have a keyboard shortcut                 |
| 28:20      | that input that just scoops the time out of [[Audio Hijack]] and drops it in my text file,                   |
| 28:24      | so that I have all the chapter notes ready to go from the moment that we're done.                        |
| 28:29      | And then as soon as we're done recording, there are no edits on daily observations,                      |
| 28:35      | it's very run and gun. So I play the intro music live, we have our conversation, I play the outro        |
| 28:41      | music, I stop recording, and then I take that file and send it off to post production with a             |
| 28:48      | service called Auphonic. And then Auphonic takes that and my text file of show notes and puts them         |
| 28:55      | together as here are the chapter marks with the times. And if there are links there, the links           |
| 29:01      | link out to everything they need to go to. And it makes it very easy because I'm basically done          |
| 29:07      | at the end of recording, like I don't have to go dig up. What was that timestamp again and go back       |
| 29:12      | and listen to myself a bunch, which is not always fun for me. And I can go and make and like all         |
| 29:20      | my timestamps are ready to go as long as I hit it when the topic changed. And I know I've got the        |
| 29:24      | right time in that timestamp, then it makes it very easy for the show notes to sort of fall              |
| 29:30      | together very quickly. So that's one that I use a lot. And Dave wrote this up for the web,               |
| 29:35      | he's got a post over at Mac Observer sharing the scripts. And I'm looking through them. I see a          |
| 29:39      | few changes I'm going to make, but I am completely cribbing this from you guys. Very smart pulling       |
| 29:46      | the start time out of [[Audio Hijack]]. That's the trick. And that's the bit I've always struggled           |
| 29:51      | with. What I ended up doing was that my macro for something similar was taking screenshots and           |
| 29:57      | cropping them down. I mean, it worked. I had all the information there. So I could go back and           |
| 30:04      | modify it later, but it really felt like I was doing it wrong. I can't believe I didn't find this        |
| 30:10      | post. So yeah, there we go. Well, it is from 2016. It's almost exactly five years old now.               |
| 30:18      | And but being able to do this effectively just makes it easier. And it works for everything.             |
| 30:27      | So if I have all the links ready to go, then the show notes are done the minute we stop recording.       |
| 30:32      | But if I also have, I can make a note there for an edit point or something,                              |
| 30:38      | here's a spot where I have to, somebody got disconnected. So here's where the audio got                  |
| 30:46      | weird. And then I can have the next timestamp for when we got it all cleared up. Let's come back         |
| 30:50      | and okay, we're going to come back and try and pick up the show again afterwards. So it makes            |
| 30:56      | it very easy to do that. And it makes it possible for daily observations to go out every day,            |
| 31:01      | because if I had to spend a truckload of time going back and getting timestamps or typing                |
| 31:07      | them by hand while someone else is talking or while I'm talking and introducing the next                 |
| 31:12      | subject and trying to do all of that at once would be too hard. So it is one of the things               |
| 31:18      | that makes it possible for us to put the daily observations podcast out daily.                           |
| 31:25      | And I just love the way everybody in the automation community is so generous with this stuff             |
| 31:29      | and shares ideas. And that gives me ideas that I can now use and kind of evolve upon what you            |
| 31:37      | guys have done. So that's awesome. And we won't dwell on this one, but there's a post and you            |
| 31:44      | can download the [[Keyboard Maestro]] script if you have a need to run timestamps. This is going to          |
| 31:49      | be a game changer for you. But you also have one that we talked about as we were prepping for            |
| 31:55      | today that I think everybody needs to hear about. Tell us about your AirPods, Kelly.                     |
| 32:01      | Okay. So my setup, as I mentioned, I have a day job and then I have obviously my own computer.           |
| 32:13      | So because I have a work phone and a work laptop and I have my own phone and my own laptop and my        |
| 32:19      | own iPad and there's another phone around here somewhere. So there's a lot of devices that               |
| 32:26      | are here that are all completely happy to connect to my AirPods, regardless. So I had this problem       |
| 32:32      | with my AirPods. I have it with my AirPods Pro. I've upgraded. Mr. Kelly is now a happy AirPods          |
| 32:39      | user and I got a pair of pros. And when I take my AirPods pros out of the case and stick them in my      |
| 32:46      | ears, they're connected 100% of the time. And me knowing what device they are connected to happens       |
| 32:55      | about 2% of the time. And so I know they're connected to something, but I don't know what.               |
| 33:02      | And so I built a shortcut that is two steps. And I have this on my personal phone and I                  |
| 33:08      | have it on my work phone. And what I do, the name, it's named headphones. So if I say headphones,        |
| 33:16      | hey lady headphones, it will invoke the shortcut and only like my personal phone listens to me say,      |
| 33:22      | hey lady, but on my work phone, I have to press the side button for it. So I'm not                       |
| 33:26      | sort of setting them up to compete against each other and like Bluetooth connection,                     |
| 33:30      | cage matches or anything. So when I invoke it, I say headphones and it sets the audio output             |
| 33:39      | to my AirPods. And then the second step is play, I think it just says play sound is the option in        |
| 33:47      | shortcuts. And that way I know when the sound plays, if it came out of my headphones, that my            |
| 33:53      | headphones are actually connected to the right thing. And then I know for sure, because I'm              |
| 33:58      | usually holding my phone in my hands, so it's very near me. So if my sound is on and I hear,             |
| 34:03      | that's done, like, was it my headphones or was it not my headphones? And sometimes it's hard to tell     |
| 34:08      | and this the tone, the little three tone, when that plays, it's very easy to tell that's right           |
| 34:14      | happening in my headphones, or it's coming out of the speaker. And so it makes it very easy for me       |
| 34:19      | to know 100% where my AirPods are connected. And that's the part that I definitely need all of the       |
| 34:27      | time. So if I'm sitting at my computer, it's easy to just hook them up, you know, click on the Bluetooth |
| 34:32      | menu. But the rest of the time, like, they're connected to something. And I just need to be              |
| 34:37      | able to figure out, I need to confirm which one it is, so that I can make my phone call, join my         |
| 34:42      | conference call, listen to music, whatever I'm doing. Okay, can I just say that I love this              |
| 34:47      | automation for, like, a bunch of reasons? And the first is that it works, you know, the AirPods are      |
| 34:53      | supposed to switch between devices. But how does [[Apple]] know which device I want to be using when         |
| 34:59      | I've got two or three of them sitting around me at the same time? So, you know, it's not, it almost      |
| 35:06      | would be creepy if they did know exactly which one I wanted every time. But the other thing I love       |
| 35:11      | about this is, you know, we do the show Automators, and we talk to a lot of people about automation.     |
| 35:16      | And some people have very complicated, you know, very deep JavaScript automation that does amazing       |
| 35:23      | things. And I love that stuff. But I want the listeners to know that you don't have to do that           |
| 35:29      | to make a very useful automation. In this case, Kelly made a, really, it's a one step automation         |
| 35:35      | in shortcuts. It's setting the output to the AirPods. And then you were smart enough to realise,         |
| 35:41      | well, Siri will allow me to trigger that shortcut with its name. So, I'll give it a name that's          |
| 35:48      | easy to say, something like headphones. And then the extra step of having to play the tone is just       |
| 35:52      | a confirmation. It's really a one step, but you've written it as a two step automation. And              |
| 35:57      | we'll get a screenshot or a link or something from Kelly so you can see it if this is new to you.        |
| 36:01      | But I just love that you made this very simple automation that just makes your life so much              |
| 36:07      | easier. You know, good on you, Kelly. It really is great. And I particularly like the addition of        |
| 36:13      | the Play Audio, because I think one of the things that [[Apple]] didn't really factor in                     |
| 36:18      | to this automated switching, because as you said, it connects to the device that you're                  |
| 36:23      | expecting it to connect to about 2% of the time. It's probably because, like me, when you put            |
| 36:29      | your AirPods in, it's not because you're going to continue using the device you were just actively       |
| 36:33      | using. It's because you're about to switch devices to something else and do a completely                 |
| 36:37      | different task. And that's the point where the automation of, I'm going to pick which thing              |
| 36:43      | I think you were using last fails miserably, because it does the same thing when it comes                |
| 36:48      | to responding to our, hey, [[Apple]] lady requests. Whereas, you know, our HomePods, our iPads,              |
| 36:54      | our iPhones have a little conference between themselves incredibly quickly to figure out                 |
| 36:59      | which one of us are you talking to? Yeah. And I mean, it's amazing that they do that, but                |
| 37:04      | they still get it wrong sometimes. Though, if you haven't turned this around, you can actually           |
| 37:11      | make sure that your phone doesn't respond if you leave it face down. By default, if your phone is        |
| 37:16      | face down, it won't listen to you. You can change that in settings, but that can be quite useful         |
| 37:22      | to make sure your phone is not picking things up. Like if you start trying to do something,              |
| 37:27      | and your phone is the one that's lighting up responding, and you've got a HomePod right there.           |
| 37:31      | First of all, it should be using the HomePod, but if you just flip your phone face down,                 |
| 37:34      | then it shouldn't do that. I wish though it could incorporate that with the Bluetooth                    |
| 37:39      | AirPods connection, because that would be pretty good. Yeah. I would very much like if I had the         |
| 37:44      | opportunity, like sometimes I really do want to connect them to my computer, or sometimes I really       |
| 37:48      | do want to connect them to my iPad, but not always. And like you said, it's the switching gears.         |
| 37:56      | And the 2% comes from there are times when I am like, I'm getting ready to go do yard work,              |
| 38:04      | or I'm going to go mow the lawn or something. And so when I put my headphones in, then                   |
| 38:10      | that's a thing that totally works, because none of my other devices are around me. And so the            |
| 38:15      | thing I connected them to is the thing I know they're connected to. Yeah. Yeah. But you have to          |
| 38:20      | actually be in exactly the right situation for all of that. And you know, that could be a little         |
| 38:26      | bit tricky, you know, and devices anticipating exactly what it is that we intend to do at the            |
| 38:31      | moment that we intend to do them. Technology is not there yet, and maybe it never will be,               |
| 38:35      | and maybe that's for the best, but certainly it's got a long way to go before it figures all this        |
| 38:40      | out. I know the recent thing that comes to mind is the shared with you stuff, where you know,            |
| 38:48      | somebody sent me a picture in a message or something, and I open [[Safari]], and [[Safari]] is going,            |
| 38:53      | hey, this was shared with you. And it's like, cool. Yeah. But I tapped on that in messages,              |
| 38:58      | and I've already seen it. I've seen it already. Yeah. Like, how are you still suggesting this            |
| 39:03      | to me? I've already seen it and read it. We're good. We're done. I have like news stories from a         |
| 39:08      | week or more ago, you know, somebody sends me a link to something, and it's still like,                  |
| 39:12      | I opened a new tab in [[Safari]], and it's still there. Like, hi. I'm like, yeah, we've done this.          |
| 39:17      | Yeah. Yeah. Been there, done that. Don't really want it again. But also, I don't actually want           |
| 39:23      | to delete it from my messages history, because it's part of the conversation. It's nice to               |
| 39:28      | be able to go back and attribute that to the right person when you're remembering things,                |
| 39:33      | or see it in context of the comments that you were making, and so on and so forth.                       |
| 39:38      | So I think maybe there's some improvements to go there. We'll see. Yeah. Because if it did know          |
| 39:45      | which thing I wanted to use, I feel like that would be worse, just for the implication of,               |
| 39:50      | you know, my, my AirPods know what thing I'm going to do next. Like, I don't feel like that's            |
| 39:56      | improvement. I'm happy to have to sort of steer every once in a while and make sure that things          |
| 40:01      | are working like they should. So I just sort of, it's nicer to have a little bit of control over         |
| 40:09      | it. And, you know, generally, like when I have, because I have a meeting at the same time every          |
| 40:15      | day, so my AirPods are good about switching, you know, at that point, if that's the first time I         |
| 40:18      | put them in my ears. So being able to sort of boss them around easily has, is super helpful,             |
| 40:26      | just with, with a very small shortcut. And that's one of the things I like about                         |
| 40:30      | shortcuts, making that easier to do, instead of having to try to, you know, create something that's      |
| 40:36      | a URL that takes me right to the Bluetooth options and settings, you know, or something                  |
| 40:40      | like that. Like it's just easier to pick up my phone and say headphones.                                 |
| 40:43      | Yeah. Yeah. Setting your audio output, I think is something that a lot of people don't necessarily       |
| 40:48      | think about as an automation. But for me, it's actually part of some of the automations I use            |
| 40:53      | most frequently with shortcuts and NFC tags, you know, I tap my phone on this NFC tag,                   |
| 40:58      | and it'll start playing this particular playlist, whatever it is. And it'll set my audio output          |
| 41:04      | to my HomePod in my office, because, you know, I want to listen to some music in my office,              |
| 41:09      | and it's great. And then from there, I can easily share it to other speakers around the house,           |
| 41:13      | or not, depending on my mood and thoughts. But, you know, it is something that I mean,                   |
| 41:20      | I used to have that as part of my leaving work every day shortcut. It would take me to the               |
| 41:25      | clock out screen so that I could, you know, clock out from work. And the login for that was a bit         |
| 41:30      | finicky, so I wasn't unfortunately able to script it. And it would set my audio output to my AirPods     |
| 41:36      | and start playing some music. All right, Rose, Rose, I got to know that when you're leaving work,        |
| 41:41      | what is your anthem? What's your song when you're leaving work?                                          |
| 41:44      | There wasn't any particular anthem or song. What it was doing is,                                        |
| 41:49      | so it was actually kind of tied into my on my way to work shortcut. So when I got to work,               |
| 41:54      | I would run a shortcut. And then that would take whatever I was playing, and it would just note it       |
| 41:59      | down. And then I was trying to use magic within that to figure out what to play. So if I've been         |
| 42:05      | listening to a podcast on the way to work, it would try to play overcast on the way home. And            |
| 42:12      | this was very, very finicky. I'm not very stable, but it always got some interesting results and         |
| 42:17      | usually gave me some ideas of things to debug on the way home from work. So yeah, it never really        |
| 42:23      | got working quite right. But I got close. I got close. I feel like when you're going into work,          |
| 42:29      | it should play the Imperial March from Star Wars. I mean, that would have been really                    |
| 42:38      | useful when I woke up late today and I was there, you know, looking at the clock going, oh yeah,         |
| 42:42      | I'm fine. You know, I've got plenty of time before stand up is in three minutes. Okay,                   |
| 42:46      | time to go. Time to go. Time to go. It's all doable with shortcuts, baby. It's all doable.               |
| 42:52      | Actually shortcuts did indeed help me because they turned on all the lights in my office to              |
| 42:56      | make sure that I wouldn't be in the dark for stand up. And that's something that actually                |
| 42:59      | happens automatically now. I need to make sure that that, I mean, the problem is you can't               |
| 43:06      | check your focus mode in shortcuts. And this is something that I feel is just like a major               |
| 43:10      | missing piece. If shortcuts could check your focus mode, that'd be great because I only want             |
| 43:15      | my lights in my office to turn on to 100% before stand up. If it's both suitably dark enough,            |
| 43:20      | that's relatively easily solved by a light sensor. But also if I'm in my work focus mode,                |
| 43:25      | if I'm not working, then I, you know, I've got the day off or something that I don't want the            |
| 43:30      | lights in my office to suddenly turn on 100% a couple of minutes before stand up. That's not             |
| 43:36      | the goal. So I need to figure out what I'm going to do there. But problem for another time.              |

| 45:22      | automation, and I know you were a little hesitant at the beginning to do [[HomeKit]],                        |
| 45:27      | but I also know that you kind of dove in at this point. So what's the state of [[HomeKit]]                   |
| 45:32      | for Kelly and what are your automations for it? Well, it sort of became more important                   |
| 45:42      | about a year ago because last November, [[Apple]] released the HomePod mini and my birthday is in            |
| 45:50      | November. And so I said I wanted one for my birthday and I got one and set it up in the kitchen          |
| 45:56      | because it was a place I wanted to have a nice speaker that was a thing that I could also talk           |
| 46:00      | to if I wanted. And so I set it up in the kitchen as sort of a test. And we had a number of              |
| 46:05      | echo units in our house. So like one echo base and some echo dots scattered around. And                  |
| 46:16      | most of what they were doing was checking the weather and turning on and off lights because I            |
| 46:21      | have an embarrassment of Hue bulbs scattered through my house. That was a good collective                |
| 46:26      | word for Hue bulbs because they're fabulous, but also quite pricey. Yes. So there are many.              |
| 46:33      | And so most of what these assistant devices were doing was just,                                         |
| 46:44      | you know, it's going to rain today or it's going to rain tomorrow because that's like                    |
| 46:48      | always the weather here. And then here, turn on the lights, turn off the lights. And that was            |
| 46:54      | really about it. So I got this HomePod mini and then they started going on deals at Costco. And so       |
| 47:04      | they would be like 10 or $15 off. So every once in a while, Mr. Kelly would go to Costco and come        |
| 47:10      | home with another one. And so I just sort of had to find places to put them. So basically you had        |
| 47:18      | the triple problem with HomePod minis. A little bit. Yeah. So like, you know, there'd just be            |
| 47:25      | one sitting on the counter, you know, that was just sort of a hint to me, like go find a place           |
| 47:31      | that this needs to be set up. So we now have, so we have them in all the places that the                 |
| 47:39      | [[Amazon]] devices were. And so now I've sort of been working everything into working properly               |
| 47:47      | with [[HomeKit]] so that it was worth it to actually start deploying those everywhere and make them          |
| 47:53      | things that it was actually useful to be able to tell her to open the door or open the garage door       |
| 48:01      | or close the garage door, turn on and off lights and set up some basic scenes for things like            |
| 48:08      | we just had Halloween, like the Halloween lighting, setting things up with Christmas lights,             |
| 48:13      | which is another couple of automations that I've built because we do a whole lot of Christmas            |
| 48:20      | at my house. So having Christmas lights easily, automatable and being able to set up set up              |
| 48:29      | stuff. So like we have some of the the LED strips from from hue and those are in the front windows       |
| 48:36      | of the house. I like two great big front windows. And so one will be red and one will be green           |
| 48:40      | during Christmas time. And like for Halloween, they were purple. And I have this app that sort of        |
| 48:44      | makes them go brighter, brighter, brighter, dimmer, dimmer, dimmer, like the house is breathing.         |
| 48:49      | And so it's like this purple. And then I've got a little Bluetooth speaker that sits in the front        |
| 48:53      | yard and and it will play like the the cue music from the haunted mansion, you know, and and then        |
| 48:58      | the house is breathing as you come up the walkway. And so yeah, being able to do that stuff and then     |
| 49:06      | and then go, okay, well, you know, it's late enough, I can just turn it all off without having to go     |
| 49:09      | outside makes it very, very convenient. Yeah, I bet. Which app are you using to do the effects           |
| 49:15      | with the hue lights? Because that's one of the things I have played with in a couple of different        |
| 49:20      | ways. And I'm currently using a great app called [[Signals for HomeKit]], which basically will let          |
| 49:26      | me run a short connection and that will do things like flash my lights or something. And I've got        |
| 49:31      | this attached to my snooze. So if I snooze my alarm in the morning, it flashes the lights in my          |
| 49:36      | bedroom obnoxiously bright, and then sets them fairly bright as a hey, Rose, you know that that          |
| 49:43      | thing about oversleeping that that's not good, you shouldn't be doing that prompt. But I've not          |
| 49:49      | had anything for for, you know, like actual effects that are continuous, because the [[Signals for HomeKit]]         |
| 49:57      | they are supposed to be a signal. So they're short. And then they stop. And that's it.         |
| 50:02      | And so what are you using for this? Yeah, I think I'm not going to remember the one                      |
| 50:10      | for the breathing. But I've used Ambify is one that I've used for with music. So I do have a             |
| 50:18      | bunch of them in the in my house has a basement. So I have a bunch of hue lights in the basement.        |
| 50:23      | And I will turn them on with music and Ambify. And I have another one called I light show.               |
| 50:32      | And the two of those will do if you are playing music, they will change the lights to the music.         |
| 50:39      | So that you get you. Yeah. So every once in a while, I will turn my basement into a discotech            |
| 50:44      | because that's a fun thing to do. I do something similar with an old [[AirPort Express]] and my              |
| 50:49      | Nanoleaf light panels on the wall, because I have the original Nanoleaf panels and the rhythm          |
| 50:54      | module for those has got an auxin. So I don't have to play my music super loud. All I do is I            |
| 51:00      | [[AirPlay]] to all of the destinations that I want to [[AirPlay]] to and set the volume of the airport           |
| 51:06      | express to maximum, because that massively increases the effect. And bam, it works. Yes,                 |
| 51:13      | it's it's certainly been an experience trying to get that there. But I have another look for             |
| 51:19      | all of these things with the hue app, because I've got more coloured hue stuff now. And I think           |
| 51:25      | it's I think it's time to get back into that and start playing. Yeah, it's it's it's a lot of fun.       |
| 51:30      | And particularly, this is another one of those things where if you sit down and spend like 10            |
| 51:37      | or 15 minutes, like, there's something that you could make better than it is right now with the          |
| 51:44      | lights that the the lights that you have, you know, that if they're smart bulbs or if you have           |
| 51:48      | smart switches or something, just sit down for a minute and like, you know, every day when I come        |
| 51:54      | home, I want this to happen, you know, or something like that. And being able to to just dedicate a      |
| 52:00      | very small amount of time, it'll be very obvious very quickly. Like this is always what I find           |
| 52:04      | when I'm trying to figure out what's the if there's a problem I'm trying to solve or something,          |
| 52:09      | just spending a few minutes on it. Sometimes we'll get you most of the way to where you need to go,      |
| 52:13      | which makes it really nice. So just sit down and go, Yeah, you know, I'm tired of coming home            |
| 52:19      | in the dark, because it was daytime when I left. And, you know, and so I didn't have the lights on,      |
| 52:26      | and then I came home, and it was dark, and now I'm coming home and the house is dark. So every           |
| 52:31      | time you come home, have the light come on. Okay, you know, like that, that kind of thing is limited     |
| 52:36      | that to after sunset for me. So when I come home, and it's after sunset, it turns on the lights.         |
| 52:41      | Then maybe I should start using my light sensor for that instead. Because, of course, clouds,            |
| 52:46      | you're familiar with this concept, Kelly. David has no idea what a cloud is. He lives in                 |
| 52:51      | a desert. David has no idea what we're talking about. What is this fluffy thing you speak of?            |
| 52:55      | I don't know what you're talking about. But yeah, there was a show about it on Discovery. I can find     |
| 53:01      | something there. Yeah, there we go. I mean, anything that's called cumulonimbus, I just                  |
| 53:07      | doubt its existence by its very name. As long as it doesn't have a number after it, and somebody's       |
| 53:12      | claiming that it does something, you know, magical like fly, I think we'll be all right                  |
| 53:18      | with that. Yeah. But you know, something Kelly said that really resonated with me is like,               |
| 53:23      | spend 10 or 15 minutes like in and make it a little better. Because when with home kit,                  |
| 53:28      | my experience is once you just make one, then making the next one is only going to take five             |
| 53:34      | to 10 minutes, you will like build your skill set and this stuff very quickly.                           |
| 53:38      | Mm hmm. And that that's what has helped me a lot is also like starting very small also made              |
| 53:45      | that a very easy thing to do. So like having a shortcut, there was two steps. And then being             |
| 53:51      | able to go, okay, well, that was, you know, that was a shortcut. Let's look at what automations          |
| 53:56      | look like because that seems a lot like a shortcut. So I'm going to see if I can                         |
| 54:01      | build something in home kit, you know, that'll do certain things when I invoke it in a particular        |
| 54:07      | way. And, and it was very easy because I had started small to turn it into something that                |
| 54:14      | was going to be usable right away and make it something very easy to do. So that was part of             |
| 54:19      | where I found it very handy to sort of get in slowly, I guess, and kind of tiptoe in,                    |
| 54:27      | because it made it a lot easier to, you know, well, in order to do the thing I need to do,               |
| 54:31      | it's maybe it's three steps. And so, you know, add like Rosemary's shortcut, add the                     |
| 54:40      | the if it's sunset, you know, if it's if it's after sunset, then make sure you turn the light on         |
| 54:45      | when I come home. And just being able to take some very basic things and find out what's available       |
| 54:51      | to you as, you know, in order to help you solve that problem. So like, I would say the same thing        |
| 54:57      | as like control centre, like if you spend 10 minutes making all the buttons in control centre,           |
| 55:01      | the things that you actually need them to be, like control centre, all of a sudden becomes               |
| 55:06      | super duper useful, you know, and it's not useful to a lot of people, depending on what's in there       |
| 55:11      | now. So put this in it or, you know, add the calculator or add the Apple TV remote or take               |
| 55:16      | away the Apple TV remote and make it something else that you use a lot instead. And it's really          |
| 55:21      | about sort of coming at it fresh every time and being able to go, Okay, this is the problem I'm          |
| 55:27      | trying to solve and be able being able to see it for what it is and not just well, this is the way       |
| 55:32      | things are, I guess I just come home and it's dark and there's nothing to be done. You know,             |
| 55:37      | like if you've been doing that your whole life and now all of a sudden, like, you know, you              |
| 55:40      | have to stop and think about this having this other option to do it instead. Are your home kit           |
| 55:45      | automations primary or light based? Have you gone down the rabbit hole of anything else? You know,       |
| 55:49      | there's a lot of other home kit stuff these days. Oh, there is. Mostly it's lights partly bulbs          |
| 55:57      | and partly switches. I have a couple of Wemo switches for places where there are no hue                  |
| 56:01      | bulbs. And I have in in automation, it's not in home kit yet. I can't control it that way. I have        |
| 56:10      | a different brain for it, but all of the landscape lighting and stuff that we have out in our yard       |
| 56:17      | and that sort of stuff that all happens on a schedule that we set up through a different                 |
| 56:22      | home automation. But the lights come on 15 minutes before sunset, and then they stay on for, I think,    |
| 56:28      | three hours or something after that. And then certain ones kick off, but like the porch light            |
| 56:34      | stays on all night. And, you know, but the yard lights all turn off after a certain amount of            |
| 56:38      | time and stuff like that. So there's been mostly it's it's light based. We do have an Ecobee             |
| 56:48      | thermostat. So I have that all set up for like if nobody's home, you know, make sure that you can        |
| 56:54      | adjust the temperature a little, you know, you don't have to be running the whole time if nobody's       |
| 56:57      | here and things like that. So I do have some of that stuff set up. And we just recently got a new        |
| 57:04      | doorknob that is home kit compatible so that it makes getting in and out of that particular              |
| 57:10      | door a little easier, because you don't have to have the keys for it now. So yeah, that was one          |
| 57:14      | of the things that really, you know, improved, you know, it sounds silly that a smart lock improved      |
| 57:21      | my life. But now I get out the car and I talk to my watch. I talk to my watch because usually my         |
| 57:25      | phone is still connected to CarPlay at that point because I've got wireless CarPlay, but I talk to       |
| 57:29      | my watch and ask it to unlock the door. As I'm grabbing, you know, whatever it is I need to grab         |
| 57:34      | or maybe nothing, but I get to the door and the door is unlocked. And I walk in and the lights           |
| 57:38      | are already on and everything. And that is, you know, is really good because I don't need to be          |
| 57:45      | fumbling around looking for keys. Obviously, I still have keys. I've got enough C tags actually          |
| 57:50      | to get into my smart locks. And I've got a couple of those around, including one that just lives in      |
| 57:55      | the car. Because if I did forget my keys, but I've got my car key, then I can get into my car and        |
| 58:01      | get a C tag. But I never use it. I never use it. It is always that I talk to my wrist and it unlocks     |
| 58:09      | the door and that's it. And that is, you know, it's definitely made my life a lot easier.                |
| 58:15      | People ask me because I did the same thing. I put the smart lock on the front door and I just love       |
| 58:20      | it with all the cool tricks you can do. Like even like my sister was coming to visit me and Daisy        |
| 58:26      | and I were coming home from something and they got to my house before I did. And they're like,           |
| 58:31      | hey, we're here early. We'll just wait in the car. I'm like, no, that's fine. I'll unlock the door       |
| 58:35      | and you can go in. And like stuff like that is great. But people do write in and say, well,              |
| 58:40      | aren't you afraid of security for that? I'm not really that afraid. I have a...                          |
| 58:46      | Locks are there to keep out the honest people as it is anyway. If somebody wants in, they don't          |
| 58:50      | care if it's a lock or a smart lock. They're just going to get in either way. They're not going to       |
| 58:54      | sit outside with a laptop and hack your door lock. They'll smash it first.                               |
| 58:58      | And I have faith in home kid of being fairly secure. I think that's pretty important to [[Apple]].           |
| 59:04      | So yeah, I just don't worry about it. And that was also a really nice upgrade. I agree.                  |
| 59:11      | Kelly, when we were talking, you and I kind of got on the subject of pesky problems,                     |
| 59:16      | which I think is kind of a fun way to think about it. I mean, you've got a mindset of like,              |
| 59:22      | hey, if there's a little problem with my technology, why don't I come up with some automation            |
| 59:26      | to solve it? And you're always coming up with these cool solutions to pesky problems.                    |
| 59:32      | Can you share one or two that you've recently done that make you smile?                                  |
| 59:37      | Well, one is not recent, but still makes me smile. And it's another one I got from you.                  |
| 59:43      | And that is the basically save as PDF and building that service and putting it on your computer.         |
| 59:50      | Apple P and having it just turn it into a PDF for me is great. And it still makes me happy.              |
| 59:58      | And I think if I recall correctly, you had to update that for like Sierra or something.                  |
| 01:00:05   | I've updated it like three times. They keep adding the semicolon, then they take it out again.           |
| 01:00:10   | And then like, you know, so every once in a while, I have to update that. But yeah,                      |
| 01:00:14   | yeah, that one is a good one. And it's one of my favourites because print to PDF is by far the            |
| 01:00:21   | bulk of the printing that I'm doing. Sure. I mean, who prints to a printer anymore?                      |
| 01:00:26   | Like, it should be, do you mean the printer should be that little button at the bottom?                  |
| 01:00:32   | It should just be PDF. And then like, if you need to put this to paper,                                  |
| 01:00:36   | you know, there's separate steps. And so that's part of why print to this print PDF service              |
| 01:00:45   | is so great. And was actually one of the things I was very nervous about last winter when I got          |
| 01:00:52   | my M1 was, oh, God, is this still going to work? Because like, I don't know if I can use my computer     |
| 01:00:57   | until David updates it, if it's not going to happen. At some point, [[Apple]] wrote an article               |
| 01:01:02   | about that in the app store. So I feel like that that trick is now canon, you know,                      |
| 01:01:07   | yes, I think it's official. So I don't, I don't have to worry quite so much. So that that makes me,      |
| 01:01:12   | it makes me happy. Another pesky problem that I work, I'm not working on solving the actual              |
| 01:01:21   | problem. I'm basically just mitigating the fact that my alarm goes off at 530 in the morning,            |
| 01:01:26   | because I'm a West Coast resident with an East Coast job.                                                |
| 01:01:30   | Ouch. Oh boy. Yeah, that's rough.                                                                        |
| 01:01:32   | When you get dressed in the dark, that can go really poorly. And when you have a meeting every           |
| 01:01:38   | morning where everybody hops on zoom on video, you kind of don't want to look like you got               |
| 01:01:44   | dressed in the dark, even if you did. And so I have some automation where the lights come on             |
| 01:01:52   | very, very dimly so that I can get dressed in the morning quietly. And I also have a Wemo outlet         |
| 01:02:00   | for hot water so that I can make coffee or tea first thing in the morning. So I've got the hot           |
| 01:02:08   | water all ready to go. I have a Zojirushi hot water boiler, I guess they're called. And so like,         |
| 01:02:17   | the water is all hot and ready so that I can have coffee or tea, whatever I'm looking for.               |
| 01:02:21   | And the lights come on, so the lights come on in the office, the lights come on in the                   |
| 01:02:26   | bedroom so I can get dressed. And I'm slowly working on optimising when they come on and                 |
| 01:02:33   | how bright they need to be and that kind of stuff just to make sure that it makes it a little easier     |
| 01:02:38   | to kind of get into the day. And particularly as we're heading into the dark times, that automation      |
| 01:02:45   | is going to be even more important. Yeah, building your own sunrise.                                     |
| 01:02:49   | Getting later in the day. Yeah, yeah, that is definitely something that,                                 |
| 01:02:54   | you know, it doesn't occur to a lot of people that, you know, that you might need that. But I            |
| 01:03:00   | know that I have found I do better in the mornings when I wake up with lights coming on slowly.          |
| 01:03:08   | And that can really help. And also, everybody has had that moment where they're sitting there            |
| 01:03:13   | and they're about to join a meeting and they look down and realise, oh, this is not the kind of          |
| 01:03:18   | clothing that I wanted to be wearing right now. Oh, dear. Yes. I have a funny story about that.          |
| 01:03:25   | I, one time I was doing a trial and I woke up at like four to get in, get up to, you know,               |
| 01:03:31   | get ready for like a closing statement and I showed up for court. I started talking to the               |
| 01:03:37   | jury and I noticed a couple of them kept looking at my shoes and I'm like, what are they doing?          |
| 01:03:41   | And I had two different colours socks on, like distinctive colours, you know, and they were                |
| 01:03:46   | looking at my socks. So I fessed up. I'm like, guys, I'm sorry, I woke up really early today.            |
| 01:03:50   | I got dressed in the dark and I put on two different colour socks. But the,                               |
| 01:03:55   | but you know, I need a home kit, but that was before home kit existed.                                   |
| 01:03:59   | I can actually sell as part of their trade free range. They sell some lights which have                  |
| 01:04:06   | got sensors on them that you can put inside of a wardrobe. And so the idea is then when you open         |
| 01:04:12   | the wardrobe, then it, it senses enough motion that it will turn the lights on at that point,            |
| 01:04:19   | but you can also just connect them to a smart driver, which is what I've done. And I actually            |
| 01:04:24   | have those, they're not inside of wardrobe. They're just sitting here above my desk,                     |
| 01:04:27   | because they are a nice warm white. And that makes me feel a lot better. Now it's getting darker.        |
| 01:04:32   | When I first installed them, I was like, Oh, I don't know. Maybe I don't really need lights up           |
| 01:04:36   | there. And now every day for the last six weeks or so, I've been coming in here and it's like,           |
| 01:04:41   | okay, I actually need to set up an automation so that when it senses motion in my office,                |
| 01:04:46   | it just turns on those lights and it leaves it on until, you know, I finished work for the day           |
| 01:04:52   | or I finished podcasting for the day, whichever comes later. So I need to figure out an automation       |
| 01:04:57   | to figure out when I finished work and or podcasting. That's a problem.                                  |
| 01:05:01   | That problem they have no doubt you'll solve. Yeah, I have that same problem.                            |
| 01:05:05   | Oh, I'm sure we will. It just might take a little while to get there and solve it right.                 |
| 01:05:10   | Like it took me forever to figure out an automation for my washing machines that I would                 |
| 01:05:14   | actually know when it was finished. I'm very pleased that I recently got that sorted.                    |

| 01:06:41   | this show and Relay FM. So, Kelly, you've been doing automation for some time now,                       |
| 01:06:47   | and you've got a lot of experience with it. What would you like to see improve with automation           |
| 01:06:52   | in general? This is going to sound like a weird answer, but failure. I would like failure to be          |
| 01:06:57   | better. Not that I don't want them to fail, because there's always going to be things that               |
| 01:07:01   | are going to fail for whatever reason, but I would like the failure to be more obvious,                  |
| 01:07:06   | and I would like the failure to be better delineated. If the problem is the script,                      |
| 01:07:16   | the JavaScript that I inserted into a shortcut or something, just tell me, I can't run the script        |
| 01:07:23   | even as opposed to just computer says no, which is usually what we get, and then you have to figure      |
| 01:07:30   | out, in my two-step shortcut, it's pretty easy to tell which step is the one that didn't work,           |
| 01:07:36   | but if you have 10 or 15 even, and that's not even close to being sort of an adult-sized                 |
| 01:07:45   | shortcut, it can be hundreds and hundreds of steps, and even just having something small,                |
| 01:07:51   | if it's one of 10 steps, like figuring out which one it is that fell over is going to be really          |
| 01:07:56   | hard. I would really like if there were better feedback. The script is like your shortcuts               |
| 01:08:02   | running or your shortcut fell over. I did four steps and it all fell apart. Sorry. Whatever              |
| 01:08:10   | it is, just being able to have some sort of starting point for whatever it is that's going               |
| 01:08:17   | wrong with a shortcut, because as I'm sure both of you know, troubleshooting something like that         |
| 01:08:21   | is not impossible. It turns into a giant pain in order to try to just even just figuring out             |
| 01:08:30   | where it is that it failed, having to put in a bunch of breaks or something and see.                     |
| 01:08:34   | Yeah, shortcuts actually used to be much better at this, and when it failed, it would kind of            |
| 01:08:39   | scroll you to the action that failed. Because what happened is if you were playing inside of             |
| 01:08:44   | the shortcut's editor rather than say from the gallery view or from a home screen or something,          |
| 01:08:49   | it would highlight the actions as they were running. And then you would see which one had failed         |
| 01:08:56   | while it was running, which was really nice. And I found it just doesn't do that anymore.                |
| 01:09:00   | And I'm not sure why it doesn't do that, because it kind of grays everything out                         |
| 01:09:06   | as though it were doing going to do that, but it just doesn't. And it's a little weird.                  |
| 01:09:13   | I think to a degree [[Apple]] wants it to just work, you know, but this is a programming                     |
| 01:09:17   | environment and error reporting is important in that. I mean, just yesterday, I mean, unrelated          |
| 01:09:24   | to this show, I was working on a shortcut that involves a new focus mode and they have triggers          |
| 01:09:30   | now in the automation tab where if you turn on a focus mode, the shortcut will run.                      |
| 01:09:36   | And that has worked for me in the past. But yesterday, I opened a new focus and it was like,             |
| 01:09:43   | nope, it's just not going to do anything. It didn't give me an error. It just didn't trigger             |
| 01:09:48   | the shortcut. And I was like, oh, what did I do wrong? And I'm like, debugging the shortcut.             |
| 01:09:52   | And I'm like, no, every step is right. If I run it manually, it works. And then finally, I used          |
| 01:09:57   | the, you know, the Trump card. I texted Rosemary. I'm like, are you getting a problem with this          |
| 01:10:02   | trigger? You know, like, and she's like, oh, yeah, that's a known thing that those triggers              |
| 01:10:07   | sometimes just don't work. And I'm like, yeah, but I didn't know. I wouldn't say it's a known            |
| 01:10:11   | thing. I would say that I was aware that a bunch of my shortcuts for the setting of a focus mode         |
| 01:10:17   | were failing because I have slash had shortcuts attached to each focus mode for when it started          |
| 01:10:24   | and when it finished to change the two, sorry, set a variable in [[Data Jar]] with my current focus          |
| 01:10:32   | mode. Because as I mentioned earlier, you can't get shortcuts to tell you what focus mode is             |
| 01:10:39   | currently running. Your iPhone can do it. Siri has this information. So it should be a possible          |
| 01:10:43   | to get it through shortcuts on the Mac. [[Jason Snell]] pointed out something that he asked in               |
| 01:10:50   | the automators forum about whether or not you can do this. And somebody found out that there's a         |
| 01:10:54   | JSON file in appeal list somewhere that you can read out and you can get your current focus mode         |
| 01:11:00   | out of it. Fabulous. Now, can we just have a shortcut section that does this, please? But                |
| 01:11:05   | either way, I was trying to run shortcuts for this and I found that half the time they were giving       |
| 01:11:10   | me the wrong focus mode, which was not good at all. So yeah, I basically landed on this,                 |
| 01:11:18   | isn't working and I filed feedback and nothing has happened yet, but I'm crossing my fingers that        |
| 01:11:23   | the shortcuts team will get to it soon. Yeah, I feel like in general, we've all been pretty hard         |
| 01:11:27   | on the shortcuts team lately because they just bit off a lot this year. And from the things I'm          |
| 01:11:34   | hearing, it sounds to me like very smart people are working very hard to get it caught up. But           |
| 01:11:41   | that's a thing like Kelly identified is like, we need more feedback. I really would have helped          |
| 01:11:46   | me yesterday to know, hey, hit an error or the trigger doesn't work right now. And so instead            |
| 01:11:54   | of me spending 30 minutes trying to figure out what I did wrong, when in essence, it's just the          |
| 01:11:58   | features and working right now. And so that's something that I think we could use. And the               |
| 01:12:03   | thing that worries me about that stuff is that a lot of people are now discovering shortcuts             |
| 01:12:08   | because it suddenly appeared on their Mac. And if their initial experiences are bad,                     |
| 01:12:14   | then it's going to be the [[Apple Maps]] problem all over again. There's some people like,                   |
| 01:12:18   | this is bad. I'm not going to do this anymore. And it's going to get a bad reputation from               |
| 01:12:22   | people who haven't spent the time. And David, the thing I take away from your story is                   |
| 01:12:30   | that not everyone has rosemary to text and go, here's what happened to my shortcut.                      |
| 01:12:37   | There are a lot of things that sort of end up that way and don't need to. That's kind of the             |
| 01:12:43   | thing is having some sort of dialogue or something that just pops up and goes, yeah,                     |
| 01:12:50   | I had to nope out halfway through whatever it is, just anything that turns it into feedback so that      |
| 01:12:56   | I know because you can end up in a different direction. I was trying to debug a shortcut of              |
| 01:13:02   | my own. And it turned out that what was happening was it had to do with Wi-Fi. There was something       |
| 01:13:08   | in my shortcut that had to do with being on Wi-Fi. And my connection to my Wi-Fi on my phone was         |
| 01:13:16   | kind of iffy. And so I had done the tap on it in Control Centre so it doesn't connect to my              |
| 01:13:20   | own Wi-Fi for a while, but I'd forgotten about it. And so I'm trying to run this shortcut and            |
| 01:13:25   | then finally figured out, it seems like it's getting to the Wi-Fi part and then choking on it            |
| 01:13:30   | and then remembered, oh, that's right. I disconnected from my Wi-Fi, which made no difference on my      |
| 01:13:36   | phone. I have unlimited data, so it wasn't a big deal that I wasn't on my own Wi-Fi for the afternoon    |
| 01:13:41   | or whatever. But that was the thing that needed to solve it. And I spent a bunch of time on a            |
| 01:13:48   | shortcut that I didn't need to spend. And so for somebody who is coming new to it and is not somebody    |
| 01:13:54   | who is hardwired for problem solving or thinks that troubleshooting is a good time,                      |
| 01:14:00   | shortcuts is going to end up with a bad reputation very rapidly or worse. It's going to end up like      |
| 01:14:06   | [[Automator]] did, which is like [[Apple]] brought it out so that people could use it instead of [[AppleScript]]           |
| 01:14:12   | and it just went nowhere. It just sits there and waits for someone to discover it and it          |
| 01:14:19   | never happens. The other problem with shortcuts and the failure is that there's no logs. Because         |
| 01:14:27   | a lot of the time during the beta period, fortunately this has been fixed now, I was                     |
| 01:14:33   | waking up and I would have alerts on my phone, which were something like shortcuts                       |
| 01:14:41   | couldn't access this random thing. And it was a random thing. It was something like                      |
| 01:14:47   | it was a random string of characters. And clearly what it was trying to do was read                      |
| 01:14:51   | something out of the system and it just didn't have access to it for whatever reason. But                |
| 01:14:56   | I didn't actually know which shortcut it was. It was something like "WF Background Shortcut               |
| 01:15:00   | Runner Error Domain 1". That was it. Oh, that's helpful. Yeah. And it's like, okay, I've got a            |
| 01:15:06   | screenshot of this favourited so that I can read this out because it's come up a few times. And           |
| 01:15:12   | then it's just like, what is going on there? Why am I as the end user getting this? And also,            |
| 01:15:23   | it says, an error occurred while running your shortcut. Great. Thank you. Which shortcut? I              |
| 01:15:28   | have 768. And why were you getting this while you were sleeping? What shortcut is running in             |
| 01:15:37   | the night time? Exactly. And in the end, I reverse engineered it based on the time and the date that     |
| 01:15:42   | the notification appeared and what shortcuts could have been running around about that time              |
| 01:15:46   | and so on and so forth. But even more recently, I got another one, which is here, which has said         |
| 01:15:52   | an error occurred while running Go To Sleep, which is actually one of my shortcuts.                      |
| 01:15:57   | And it says invalid parameter. Okay, cool. But what parameter was invalid? This shortcut                 |
| 01:16:05   | doesn't accept input. Shortcuts is a programming language. It's a very simple one that hopefully         |
| 01:16:13   | anybody can pick up and learn. But they do have to treat the debug and the error reporting.              |
| 01:16:20   | I think they have to treat it even with extra care. Whereas with a traditional programming               |
| 01:16:26   | environment, you're dealing with people who are computer scientists and you can be a little vague        |
| 01:16:32   | with your error reporting. But with shortcuts, I think it needs to be even more explicit.                |
| 01:16:40   | The step to display an alert failed. I'd like to see them. And I think right now, they're like,          |
| 01:16:48   | hey, why are you guys giving us this hard time? We're just trying to get all the pipes connected         |
| 01:16:52   | and the water running to the right places. And I get that. But I hope that it's on the whiteboard        |
| 01:16:58   | somewhere to get better at error reporting because it is a hang up for a lot of us.                      |
| 01:17:03   | I mean, honestly, as a programmer, my day job is programming. When I do something wrong in a             |
| 01:17:09   | program and an error occurs, I would say 95% of the time, the error message that I get back,             |
| 01:17:16   | well, it doesn't necessarily state exactly what the problem is of, hey, Rose, you missed a semicolon     |
| 01:17:21   | here or something like that. It will lead me to the line where that error is. And then I can look        |
| 01:17:28   | at the line and go, oh, I see what the problem is. There we go, fixed. And by dint of leading me to      |
| 01:17:35   | where the problem is, it's not holding my hand through the entire thing as a programmer expected         |
| 01:17:39   | to be able to solve these problems myself. And I think if you're creating shortcuts, you should be       |
| 01:17:44   | expected to be able to poke at it yourself and see what the problem is, but they need to tell you        |
| 01:17:48   | where the error is. Otherwise, it's like saying, there is a bug in your house. Great. Cool. What         |
| 01:17:55   | kind of bug is this? Where is it? Does it make sound? Does it like light or dark? Does it like           |
| 01:18:00   | dry places or damp places, et cetera? Or is it actually not a physical, not a animal creature,           |
| 01:18:06   | insect kind of bug, but like a listening bug or something like that, which is completely different.      |
| 01:18:10   | And you have to look for it totally differently. It's a very ambiguous thing when your shortcut          |
| 01:18:15   | failed. Yeah. Great. Right. And, you know, and let's say that shortcut fails and now all, you            |
| 01:18:20   | know, to use your, there's a bug in your house. And as a result, all your doors are locked. So           |
| 01:18:24   | have fun with that. Yeah. Yeah. Or all of your lights have turned on at three o'clock in the             |
| 01:18:28   | morning to full brightness. By the way, good morning. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That was a fun                |
| 01:18:36   | experience when that one, when that automation went wrong. Fortunately, I was at home alone.             |
| 01:18:42   | So there was nobody else to complain, but let's just say grumpy troubleshooting. Not good. The           |
| 01:18:47   | correct solution to the problem was get up and find the motion sensor, shove it under the bed,           |
| 01:18:53   | and I hope I remember where it is in the morning. Or throw it out the window. That works too.            |
| 01:18:57   | It was called outside. So I wasn't going to open the window for that.                                    |
| 01:19:00   | Then of course something runs by it outside and then your lights go on again.                            |
| 01:19:04   | Definitely. Yeah. I agree. I think that's something that could get better. Overall,                      |
| 01:19:13   | I'm really happy with the, especially on the Mac, the number of different ways we can automate.          |
| 01:19:19   | It's crazy. And they all kind of serve a different purpose. I guess we should have                       |
| 01:19:24   | mentioned Rose at the beginning of the show. Keyboard Master has a new version out, guys.                |
| 01:19:30   | Yeah. Yeah. We're going to dive into that at some point in the not too distant future.                   |
| 01:19:33   | Yeah. We're going to give it an episode, but it looks really good. But I mean,                           |
| 01:19:38   | you've got stuff like [[Keyboard Maestro]] and [[AppleScript]] and [[JavaScript]], but you've also got                |
| 01:19:42   | basic things like shortcuts, which shortcuts actually does some very complex things and                  |
| 01:19:48   | makes them basic. So we've got a nice stack, but man, when things go wrong, especially with              |
| 01:19:54   | shortcuts, it's really hard to figure out what went wrong. Very hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.                  |
| 01:20:00   | Well, anyway, Kelly, thank you so much for coming out on the show today. I'm always interested to        |
| 01:20:05   | hear what you are up to. I love all the automations that you've come up with to make your life easier.   |
| 01:20:11   | Sounds like you haven't made Mr. Kelly crazy with your lights. And that's good too,                      |
| 01:20:14   | because that can happen when you start going down the hill.                                              |
| 01:20:17   | He was responsible for that. As a matter of fact, he, much like the HomePod Minis,                     |
| 01:20:24   | they just sort of kept coming home. And so it mostly turned into he thinks something like that           |
| 01:20:35   | would be fun. And so it starts appearing. And then it's kind of up to me to figure out                   |
| 01:20:39   | what deployment looks like on something like that. Sounds like he's got a really good end                |
| 01:20:43   | of the deal there. He kind of does. He just gets the end result of it works. Well, sometimes.            |
| 01:20:50   | Sometimes it's up to him to figure out what's going on. We had smart vents that were supposed to         |
| 01:20:58   | help make the air circulate better so that the rooms upstairs, because heat rises. So if the             |
| 01:21:06   | heat's on, making sure that they close off the upstairs rooms so that the downstairs rooms get           |
| 01:21:11   | a little bit more heat and then it's a little more even overall. And so that was all his project.        |
| 01:21:16   | I wasn't going to mess with that. But a bunch of lights and being able to sync them to music             |
| 01:21:22   | or make the front of the house do something interesting for Halloween decorations or Christmas           |
| 01:21:28   | decorations is definitely something where I'm happy to donate some of the time to that.                  |
| 01:21:33   | So it's sometimes it's fun and sometimes it's a little bit frustrating. But most of the time,            |
| 01:21:40   | it's really just a question of, I wonder if we could do this and then trying out different ways          |
| 01:21:48   | to solve it and see if there's something that actually either makes sense or makes it more               |
| 01:21:53   | fun in some way. Where most of my automation goes to is making something fun or interesting.             |
| 01:21:59   | We should start a thread in the Automators forum of times that you've made your spouse angry with        |
| 01:22:04   | automation. Maybe it should be titled the time I nearly got divorced or something. Even if you're        |
| 01:22:15   | not married to your partner, I can imagine them being angry enough that that might be the                |
| 01:22:21   | considered solution to their problems at that moment in time with some of the issues that                |
| 01:22:26   | people encounter. In my bedside table, I have a [[Lutron]] switch, which is like the Panic switch.           |
| 01:22:32   | If I push it, it turns all the lights in the house on. Like at night, if you hear a noise,               |
| 01:22:38   | I just reach over and push that button. But I also program it that if you long press it,                 |
| 01:22:44   | it turns all the lights off in the house. And I have to do a thing with my eyes at nights.               |
| 01:22:51   | My eyes are closed and I reached in the thing to turn off my own bedroom lights, but I pushed the        |
| 01:22:56   | wrong button. And then I heard my wife who was working downstairs say, hey, I'm in the dark.             |
| 01:23:04   | Because my eyes are closed. I didn't know I just turned off all the lights now.                          |
| 01:23:08   | That stuff will get you in trouble. I think that would be a funny.                                       |
| 01:23:12   | We need to talk about that before. Oh, I've had that. When we first got                                  |
| 01:23:17   | some Hue lights, they were still pretty novel. It's been a lot of years. We've had                       |
| 01:23:21   | Hue lights for a long time. We got them like pre home kit even. And so every once in a while,            |
| 01:23:27   | because I've worked from home for many years and Mr. Kelly does not. And so I found out later            |
| 01:23:33   | that like every once in a while, randomly, the lights would like turn on, like some of them              |
| 01:23:38   | would turn on and then they'd turn off and then they'd turn on again, turn off again.                    |
| 01:23:42   | And I just figured he was doing something with his phone or something. And so I'd text him and           |
| 01:23:47   | I'd be like quit playing with the lights. And it turns out that like this happened two or three          |
| 01:23:52   | times. And I found out later that what was happening was he was showing somebody like,                   |
| 01:23:56   | look, I have this app on my phone so I can turn on the lights even from here. And so he's like           |
| 01:24:01   | turning them on and turning them off and going like, look, see, I can turn them on. I can turn           |
| 01:24:05   | them off. And then so he would do it a couple of times waiting for the inevitable question               |
| 01:24:09   | from the person he was showing, which is, well, like, how do you know that's working? And about          |
| 01:24:13   | the time the person says, how do you know that's working? Mr. Kelly gets a text from his wife that       |
| 01:24:18   | says quit playing with the lights. So what you really need is just an automated text that you            |
| 01:24:23   | can send periodically that says quit playing with the lights. Knock it off. So yeah, so I found out      |
| 01:24:30   | later that was the verification was because, well, yeah, that's Kelly. She's telling me not to play      |
| 01:24:35   | with the lights anymore. Or you could set up a light sensor and have it go automatically if it           |
| 01:24:39   | just detects lights going off. Another one that gets me in trouble is noise canceling headphones         |
| 01:24:45   | when I turn on like a podcast or music and then nothing's playing. So I start fiddling with the          |
| 01:24:51   | volume and I realise that, oh, it's sending music to the HomePods. Everybody in the house except me      |
| 01:24:56   | is listening to whatever I wanted. That happens soon. Oops. Either way, you can actually make            |
| 01:25:03   | your spouse happy with this stuff too. We're just going to get you in trouble where the                  |
| 01:25:07   | automators are going to get better at it. And you can find us over at relay.fm/automators          |
| 01:25:13   | where we've got a great catalogue with lots of stuff, including [[HomeKit]]. Maybe we'll make a                |
| 01:25:17   | show called How to Use [[HomeKit]] and Not Get Divorced. Maybe that's a future episode. I don't know.         |
| 01:25:22   | I think that that could be a good future episode, David. And I'm up for it. We can start with a          |
| 01:25:28   | smart extension lead for Christmas lights that I just purchased. Kelly, where can people find you?       |
| 01:25:33   | Well, you can find me hosting the Daily Observations podcast over at macobserver.com.                    |
| 01:25:40   | You can occasionally find me over at the incomparable on I Want My MCU TV and some of the                |
| 01:25:46   | other stuff there too. You can find me on The Aftershow at aftershowpodcast.com,                         |
| 01:25:52   | which I do with Mike Rose and the rest of the time. I talk to other people on their podcast              |
| 01:25:58   | like this. I've been on Intouch with iOS recently. And I think I'm back on that tomorrow again.          |
| 01:26:04   | And I'm also on Twitter as Verso. All right. V-E-R-S-O. Thank you to our sponsors this week,             |
| 01:26:13   | and that's our friends at LinkedIn and Hunter Douglas. Where the automators, you can find                |
| 01:26:17   | the automators forums that we just talked about at automator... I'm sorry, talk.automators.fm.           |
| 01:26:23   | So go check that out, and we'll see you next time. Goodbye, everyone.                                    |

| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and welcome to the Automators.                                                 |
| 00:05      | Today, I'm joined as always by my lovely host, Rosemary Orchard.                                       |
| 00:10      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                               |
| 00:11      | Hi, Rosemary.                                                                                          |
| 00:12      | Is that bad if I say lovely hosts, because you're a lovely person, but I don't want to                 |
| 00:19      | get in trouble.                                                                                        |
| 00:20      | I mean, I take it as a compliment.                                                                     |
| 00:21      | So, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 00:22      | Good, good.                                                                                            |
| 00:23      | Okay, thank you.                                                                                       |
| 00:24      | And we are also joined today by the guest I've been wanting to land out for a little while.            |
| 00:29      | And the show Ryan J. A. Murphy.                                                                        |
| 00:31      | Hey, guys, and I'm frustrated that I'm not also lovely, David.                                         |
| 00:35      | Well, you know, the dashing Ryan J. Murphy.                                                            |
| 00:39      | I'm looking at your picture right now, and, gang, you don't get the benefit of Ryan's                  |
| 00:44      | zoom picture, but he's looking off-camera.                                                             |
| 00:47      | He's not looking right into the lens.                                                                  |
| 00:48      | He's in a nice suit and tie.                                                                           |
| 00:51      | And I will tell you, you'll have to take my word for it, Ryan certainly is dashing.                    |
| 00:57      | I am going to admit something on air, I guess it'll be recorded forever.                               |
| 01:01      | That's actually a wedding photo that I Photoshopped the boutonniere out of.                            |
| 01:06      | Oh, really?                                                                                            |
| 01:07      | Good job on that.                                                                                      |
| 01:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09      | I was going to say, you look really well rested, which for a new dad, that doesn't seem right.         |
| 01:13      | Your eyes should be a little darker.                                                                   |
| 01:14      | Yeah, that wasn't recent.                                                                              |
| 01:15      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16      | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 01:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:18      | Well, gang, Ryan kind of landed on my radar, I know that you Rose, just with making some               |
| 01:23      | incredible plugins for [[Obsidian]], but he's also very active on the Mac Power Users forums.              |
| 01:29      | He is a class one automator, I don't know how else to put it.                                          |
| 01:33      | Ryan doesn't just automate stuff when there's a problem, he needs us all, he builds the                |
| 01:37      | tool to do it as well.                                                                                 |
| 01:39      | So we are really looking forward to talking to you today about some of your favourite automations       |
| 01:43      | and also kind of some of more of the meta questions around automation, which I think                   |
| 01:47      | you have some interesting thoughts on.                                                                 |
| 01:50      | So thanks for coming on the show.                                                                      |
| 01:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:52      | Thanks for having me.                                                                                  |
| 01:53      | It feels like I've made it as an automator.                                                            |
| 01:55      | This is proof of concept at least that I haven't made too many mistakes so far.                        |
| 02:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 02:01      | Well, I mean, somebody wrote in the forums like, hey, Sparky, you got to get Ryan on                   |
| 02:04      | the show.                                                                                              |
| 02:05      | And my email to you said, the people have spoken.                                                      |
| 02:07      | I don't know if you remember that, but I'm like, yeah, we got to get Ryan on, of course.               |
| 02:12      | And I am a user of some of your products as well.                                                      |
| 02:18      | Maybe let's just start a little bit, tell us a little bit about yourself and how did                   |
| 02:21      | you get into automation?                                                                               |
| 02:23      | Sure.                                                                                                  |
| 02:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 02:25      | Well, actually, first, I should say, you know, shout out to the MPU and Automators forums                 |
| 02:30      | because there's just such a great community, right?                                                    |
| 02:32      | I've been getting a lot of love there lately, which obviously makes me feel good.                      |
| 02:35      | But even before, people were so complimentary of the stuff I've been contributing.                     |
| 02:40      | It's just such a great place to hang out.                                                              |
| 02:43      | So yeah, thanks to those.                                                                              |
| 02:45      | Thanks to you folks for hosting that and to all those folks.                                           |
| 02:48      | Yeah, I want to take credit for that because we had it on Facebook and it was getting ugly             |
| 02:54      | because people that weren't in our family were showing up.                                             |
| 03:00      | And everybody told me, because I was the one that said, we got to get out of there.                    |
| 03:04      | And everybody told me, well, when you do that, just plan on it, you're going to have like              |
| 03:08      | 10% of the people come over and it's going to be a shell of what it used to be.                        |
| 03:14      | And what happened was everybody came over and then even more people started signing                    |
| 03:19      | up because people that wanted to sign up before wouldn't because it was on Facebook.                   |
| 03:24      | So I'll tell you, if you're afraid of moving your forum off Facebook, you shouldn't be.                |
| 03:31      | And honestly, you know, the [[Mac Power Users]] and the [[Focused]] listeners are amazing folks.               |
| 03:35      | I mean, I was just telling [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] recently, I had a problem that I Googled and the answer             |
| 03:40      | came up in the forum that I pay for.                                                                   |
| 03:42      | So there you go.                                                                                       |
| 03:44      | Yeah, I was troubleshooting something with an [[Alfred]] [[AppleScript]] automation the other                 |
| 03:49      | day.                                                                                                   |
| 03:50      | And so I Googled it and the automators forum came up.                                                  |
| 03:51      | It's like, okay, the universe is telling me something here.                                            |
| 03:54      | And of course, [[Stephen Millard]], who's been on the show before, was the one there with                   |
| 03:57      | the answer to that particular conundrum and it's like, okay, wonderful.                                |
| 04:00      | Thank you very much.                                                                                   |
| 04:01      | Moving on.                                                                                             |
| 04:02      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 04:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:04      | And that's actually how I found out about you, Ryan, because I was trying to solve some                |
| 04:07      | of the problems I had with [[Obsidian]].                                                                   |
| 04:09      | And every single time I Googled something or I searched the [[Obsidian]] forums or the Mac                 |
| 04:13      | Power users forums, it was you coming back with the answer to it every single time.                    |
| 04:17      | And I was thoroughly impressed because it's not that you have an answer for everything,                |
| 04:21      | but you seem to be willing to look for a solution to lots of problems.                                 |
| 04:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:27      | I mean, I used to be a gamer.                                                                          |
| 04:29      | And then for a while, I realised how much time I was spending gaming.                                  |
| 04:34      | Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it wasn't meaningful to me.                             |
| 04:38      | And I took a step back and I like finding these kinds of hobbies where you can spend                   |
| 04:44      | hours and it's nice because you can only check in and onto these forums like a couple                  |
| 04:49      | of minutes at a time.                                                                                  |
| 04:50      | Right?                                                                                                 |
| 04:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:52      | So while the baby is, for context for the listeners, we have a 10 month old here.                      |
| 04:57      | So it's been an interesting 10 months, but it's a great little dose of dopamine to help                |
| 05:03      | somebody on the internet with a two minute break from taking care of the baby.                         |
| 05:07      | So I'm happy to help.                                                                                  |
| 05:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:09      | Glad I could be of service.                                                                            |
| 05:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:11      | I find the same thing.                                                                                 |
| 05:12      | You know, as my day job, I help people with really difficult problems.                                 |
| 05:17      | But as I get older, my happy chemicals really come a lot more from helping people out with             |
| 05:22      | MacSparky problems.                                                                                   |
| 05:24      | There is something to that, you know, to make a little difference in someone's life.                   |
| 05:29      | But the dashing Ryan J Murphy has been talking about the forums.                                       |
| 05:32      | I wanted to hear about you.                                                                            |
| 05:34      | Sure.                                                                                                  |
| 05:35      | So how did you get on this road of automation?                                                         |
| 05:39      | I know you said you started as a gamer, but you also bring some technical skills to bear               |
| 05:43      | as well.                                                                                               |
| 05:44      | That's true.                                                                                           |
| 05:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:46      | I mean, I was thinking about this question, arguably it started when I was five.                       |
| 05:50      | Have you ever heard of the incredible machine?                                                         |
| 05:52      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 05:53      | I have not.                                                                                            |
| 05:54      | No?                                                                                                    |
| 05:55      | You have, David?                                                                                       |
| 05:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 05:58      | I mean, I was too old for it, but I remember that.                                                     |
| 05:59      | No.                                                                                                    |
| 06:00      | When I was like a five year old and my parents brought in the first Windows desktop, you               |
| 06:04      | know, taupe machine into the home office, one of the games was the incredible machine.                 |
| 06:11      | And it's this old DOS game that is basically a bunch of puzzles that are made up of Rube               |
| 06:17      | Goldberg machines, right?                                                                              |
| 06:19      | And so when you asked me this question, I was thinking about what my start was.                        |
| 06:23      | And since so many automations really are Rube Goldberg machines, you know, these contraptions          |
| 06:27      | where you stitch together a thousand different little pieces that really probably shouldn't            |
| 06:31      | work together, but because you're able to fill in the gaps and because so many developers              |
| 06:35      | have made some brilliant kind of magic glues that fit everything together, you can make                |
| 06:41      | some incredible things.                                                                                |
| 06:43      | So that would be my jokey answer is probably when I was a kid playing around with the incredible       |
| 06:46      | machine on DOS machine.                                                                                |
| 06:50      | But I do have a background in degree in software engineering.                                          |
| 06:54      | And right about that time I got into the Mac, I was a Windows user, I was actually a Windows           |
| 06:58      | power user, I think up until I got into computer science and then I needed a [[Unix]] subsystem.           |
| 07:06      | And at the time, it really didn't want to run Linux.                                                   |
| 07:07      | So I jumped on a Mac, I opened up [[Alfred]] for the first time and away it went from there.               |
| 07:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:12      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 07:13      | And I do think that like, there's a reason when Rose and I had [[Sal Soghoian]], we play the                |
| 07:18      | game of mousetrap with him, because for so many of us, it is automation is, you know,                  |
| 07:24      | this jumping onto that, that jumping onto this.                                                        |
| 07:26      | So it's pretty, I think that's a common story for a folk.                                              |
| 07:31      | When I was a kid, I forget the name of, there was a game that was, there was a, I guess                |
| 07:37      | you call it a game, but it was a utility where you could make your own games.                          |
| 07:41      | And that was a very much an automation kind of jumping off point for me in the terms of                |
| 07:46      | programming in terms, because I just wanted to make my own games.                                      |
| 07:49      | And then all of a sudden you start learning the concepts.                                              |
| 07:52      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 07:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:54      | And then also, so when you got onto the Mac, you eventually found your way to [[Obsidian]],                |
| 08:01      | which is the thing Rose and I try not to talk about every episode, because we love it so               |
| 08:05      | much, but today I think I have free license to do that.                                                |
| 08:09      | So what brought you to [[Obsidian]] and why is that the app that you have embraced so heartily?            |
| 08:15      | Yeah, it's a great question.                                                                           |
| 08:17      | I mean, a couple of years ago, we might have been a year and a half now that we saw this               |
| 08:22      | new sort of revolution in Notes apps and Roam was making a lot of, a lot of, hey, and                  |
| 08:28      | a lot, everybody was talking about it.                                                                 |
| 08:30      | I came across [[Obsidian]] from a post on MPU, I think it was actually Quorum, who shared                  |
| 08:34      | the original post about [[Obsidian]], and I played around with it and just the principles clicked          |
| 08:39      | with me.                                                                                               |
| 08:40      | I got into the [[Discord]] and talked to the devs and they clicked with me.                                |
| 08:42      | It wasn't at that time as powerful, I think as Roam, but you could just tell that the                  |
| 08:47      | folks behind the app are brilliant, Erika and Shida, and they've done something, you                  |
| 08:52      | know, in business school, they teach about strategic advantages, right?                                |
| 08:55      | And strategic advantage is something that's inevitable.                                                |
| 08:57      | You can't imitate it, you can't build it if you're a competitor.                                       |
| 09:00      | And I think with [[Obsidian]], they've really built this app that is so well engineered                    |
| 09:06      | and well designed on sort of fundamental levels.                                                       |
| 09:09      | It's like, it's got an API all the way down.                                                           |
| 09:11      | And if you can play with a little bit of JavaScript, we've actually using that complicated.            |
| 09:16      | I know I say that as somebody with a degree in computer science, but we're actually running            |
| 09:21      | an event.                                                                                              |
| 09:22      | Oh, this is the perfect time to talk about an event in this month, we're running [[Obsidian]]              |
| 09:26      | October.                                                                                               |
| 09:27      | Have you two heard of this?                                                                            |
| 09:28      | I have not, no.                                                                                        |
| 09:29      | We were jealous of National Novel Rating Month, right, NaNoWriMo or Record Production Month.           |
| 09:33      | So NaNoWriMo happens in November, Record Production Month happens in February, and the idea with       |
| 09:37      | those two months is to write a novel in November or produce an album in February.                      |
| 09:41      | And so we were talking in the [[Obsidian]] [[Discord]] and we're just saying, why isn't there something        |
| 09:47      | for contributing to [[Obsidian]] like this?                                                                |
| 09:49      | So [[Obsidian]] October, the very first ever [[Obsidian]] October is currently on the go.                      |
| 09:54      | And the idea is that people are encouraged to contribute to the [[Obsidian]] community in                  |
| 09:57      | whatever way they want.                                                                                |
| 09:58      | A lot of people are building themes for the first time and getting their hands dirty with              |
| 10:01      | CSS.                                                                                                   |
| 10:02      | Some people are building plugins if they are comfortable with JavaScript and TypeScript.               |
| 10:06      | And then other people are just like writing documents that help other people with the                  |
| 10:10      | use of the app or writing workflows or whatever, right?                                                |
| 10:13      | And it's just a really nice, I mean, I think that represents those principles that I was               |
| 10:16      | talking about a second ago.                                                                            |
| 10:18      | It's just like such a great community.                                                                 |
| 10:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:21      | I kind of had that experience.                                                                         |
| 10:22      | I was a little behind you because my initial takes at [[Obsidian]] didn't stick because it                 |
| 10:29      | was very basic when it first started and Roam was quite a bit ahead of it.                             |
| 10:34      | But I was not having good experiences in the Roam forums.                                              |
| 10:38      | Like a couple of times I had, like I was asking for some features and then people were like            |
| 10:43      | kind of messaging me mean stuff.                                                                       |
| 10:45      | And I just felt like it wasn't a very warm and comforting place.                                       |
| 10:50      | And I know that's not a reason to abandon an app, but the problem that I had was really                |
| 10:55      | a serious one because of the data storage model with Roam is on the web.                               |
| 10:59      | And I didn't see that they were going to give me the encryption I wanted.                              |
| 11:04      | So whereas [[Obsidian]] was saying, no, we're going to do it.                                              |
| 11:07      | And I just looked, it was October of last year that I went 100% in on [[Obsidian]].                        |
| 11:13      | There was like six months there where I was jumping around like Roam and then I would                  |
| 11:18      | try Kraft and then I try [[Obsidian]].                                                                     |
| 11:20      | But the problem with an app like this is once you start putting your life into it, it's                |
| 11:24      | not an easy transition out of it.                                                                      |
| 11:27      | And I knew that at some point I had to get on a single horse and ride that horse.                      |
| 11:32      | And it was the encryption thing where ultimately I decided, you know what?                             |
| 11:37      | I'm just going to have faith that these [[Obsidian]] people are going to get the app up to speed.          |
| 11:41      | And they did.                                                                                          |
| 11:42      | Like within a few months of that, [[Obsidian]] was very powerful.                                          |
| 11:46      | But that's cool.                                                                                       |
| 11:47      | So where do people go if they want to participate in [[Obsidian]] October?                                 |
| 11:51      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 11:52      | Sure, sure.                                                                                            |
| 11:53      | It's, I mean, just the [[Obsidian]] forums, I think it's forum.obsidian.md.                                |
| 11:58      | You can find out a bit about the info there and the announcements.                                     |
| 12:01      | And then joining the [[Discord]] and there's a special channel called [[Obsidian]] October.                    |
| 12:05      | You can join to see what other people are up to.                                                       |
| 12:08      | And people are sharing what they're learning as they develop.                                          |
| 12:09      | And it's just, it really is a bit of serendipity, I think, to see a community forum around             |
| 12:16      | such a, you know, relatable thing for so many people, note-taking.                                     |
| 12:20      | And yet everybody wants to help each other and build tools that really change what people              |
| 12:26      | are able to do.                                                                                        |
| 12:27      | No, I was bragging about the NPU forums earlier.                                                       |
| 12:30      | I feel like [[Obsidian]]'s the same way.                                                                   |
| 12:32      | It's a very supportive environment.                                                                    |
| 12:34      | Whatever your problem is, somebody will try and help you.                                              |
| 12:36      | And for any of our listeners that look at the forum, by the way, and think, huh, this                  |
| 12:39      | looks familiar, they're using the same forum software that alternators in my power uses                |
| 12:42      | uses, which of course is the best forum software at [[Discord]].                                           |
| 12:46      | Although I really don't like the colour scheme.                                                         |
| 12:48      | I get it, you know, I get it.                                                                          |
| 12:51      | I switched it to light mode.                                                                           |
| 12:52      | I know that's heresy, but I did.                                                                       |
| 12:56      | I visited it most of the time during the day.                                                          |
| 12:58      | I tried to avoid visiting forums in the evenings and how it's getting to winter.                       |
| 13:01      | It's getting dark out earlier.                                                                         |
| 13:03      | But yeah, I switched it to light mode.                                                                 |
| 13:05      | I'm sorry.                                                                                             |
| 13:06      | The [[Obsidian]] forum.                                                                                    |
| 13:07      | I do love it.                                                                                          |
| 13:08      | I'm old enough that the first computers I used all had like dark screen and green or                   |
| 13:12      | orange text, you know, and then to me, the light screen represents the Mac like the Mac                |
| 13:18      | came into my life.                                                                                     |
| 13:19      | That's when the light screen kind of like took over and it was like, yeah, this is a                   |
| 13:23      | modern computer.                                                                                       |
| 13:24      | So now that everybody wants to go back to dark, I guess it's almost like a fashion thing,              |
| 13:28      | but it's just not for me.                                                                              |
| 13:30      | But what I wanted to ask you, you had said earlier, you know, JavaScript is not that                   |
| 13:35      | difficult and I would agree because I did grow up a nerd and I have played with programming            |
| 13:41      | over the years, but I am not a computer scientist and I think JavaScript is something anybody          |
| 13:46      | can learn.                                                                                             |
| 13:47      | Do you have any places you would recommend folks go to if they want to play with JavaScript            |
| 13:52      | or kind of pick up the basics?                                                                         |
| 13:54      | Well, I think worrying about learning JavaScript is probably the wrong way to start if you're          |
| 13:58      | just looking to, if you're using [[Obsidian]] and you want to play around with plugin development          |
| 14:02      | or theme development, it's probably best to just think of that.                                        |
| 14:06      | That's the main thing that I, the main piece of advice that I would give anybody interested            |
| 14:08      | in learning how to code is actually don't worry about, you know, picking a language                    |
| 14:11      | or picking a tool set, pick a project, pick something you want to build and then solve                 |
| 14:17      | the problem.                                                                                           |
| 14:18      | But there are a lot of, so actually a little bit of important information, [[Obsidian]] is actually        |
| 14:25      | written most of the time using, and it's plugins, written most of the time using TypeScript,           |
| 14:29      | which is a layer on top of JavaScript and Rose, you probably know way more about this                  |
| 14:32      | than me.                                                                                               |
| 14:33      | Honestly, I shouldn't have been allowed to graduate with my degree, I did okay, I was                  |
| 14:39      | an honour student, but only in the books, not in the development skills.                                |
| 14:43      | So I'm not actually that talented of a developer, but TypeScript helps with that because what          |
| 14:49      | TypeScript does, it uses, I guess, if you set it up right and there's lots of guides                   |
| 14:54      | to doing so on the [[Obsidian]] forums, you're going to use an app like VS Code, which is                  |
| 14:59      | a development environment, and it just gives really intelligent suggestions for what you               |
| 15:04      | should type next, basically.                                                                           |
| 15:06      | And so I would say if you want to get started in playing around with this, pick a project,             |
| 15:12      | pick something that you want to change about the experience of using [[Obsidian]], and then                |
| 15:17      | open up the development environment, VS Code, and start playing with something that already            |
| 15:22      | exists.                                                                                                |
| 15:23      | The interesting thing about the [[Obsidian]] community is that a lot of these plugins are open source,     |
| 15:27      | they're on GitHub, you can go and pull somebody else's plugin, a lot of people are really good         |
| 15:31      | about commenting and explaining what everything's doing, and you can actually just pick it apart.      |
| 15:36      | So that's the other layer of learning this stuff, I would say, pick a project and then                 |
| 15:41      | find somebody who's doing something similar and reverse engineer that by literally looking             |
| 15:44      | at it.                                                                                                 |
| 15:45      | I would agree with that as well, just because it's so easy to go, oh right, so the first               |
| 15:51      | stumbling block here is I need to learn how to code, I can't do that.                                  |
| 15:54      | And actually Ryan, I have to go back to something you said, you said you shouldn't have been           |
| 15:57      | allowed to graduate with your degree because you don't feel like you really know what you're           |
| 16:00      | doing.                                                                                                 |
| 16:01      | Nobody really does with programming, like there are days when stuff does absolutely just flow          |
| 16:05      | and you know exactly what you're doing, but just like with any job, there are days where               |
| 16:09      | you're sitting there staring at something going, why doesn't this work?                                |
| 16:13      | And I've had one of those days today, in case you can't tell, but no, no, it's one of those            |
| 16:19      | things.                                                                                                |
| 16:20      | I'm beginning to use React, which I'm kind of familiar with, but it's a whole other                   |
| 16:24      | thing in JavaScript.                                                                                   |
| 16:26      | But TypeScript definitely is, it does help make things easier.                                         |
| 16:30      | What happens for people who are interested in a little bit more of the technical size,                 |
| 16:33      | that should then be transpiled to JavaScript, which then is what actually gets used inside             |
| 16:40      | of the plugin.                                                                                         |
| 16:41      | But it means that you can say, for example, this thing has to be a Boolean or something,               |
| 16:46      | which you can't usually do in JavaScript, but because you can do that in TypeScript,                   |
| 16:50      | it does make programming a little easier.                                                              |
| 16:52      | So I've got some links to what TypeScript is generically, as well as Visual Studio Code                |
| 16:56      | and a link in the forums to the [[Obsidian]] forums to how to start developing a plugin.                   |
| 17:02      | But your advice about pick something that does something similar already and pick that                 |
| 17:08      | apart, that is absolutely 100% where it would start every single time.                                 |
| 17:12      | And actually, whenever I want to create a complicated automation, even if I already know the language  |
| 17:16      | and I know how things work, I do that because you don't need to reinvent the wheel.                    |
| 17:22      | You can't just steal, and you should, because that's how programming works.                            |
| 17:27      | I have an idea for [[Obsidian]] October for you, Ryan.                                                     |
| 17:29      | Why don't you just run a screencast and open one of your plugins, like your workbench and              |
| 17:35      | just explain how it works and how you built it for folks who want to follow in your wake               |
| 17:40      | and give them a little bit of a boost.                                                                 |
| 17:43      | I know I'd watch it.                                                                                   |
| 17:44      | That's a good idea.                                                                                    |
| 17:45      | I can think about it, however, somebody else has already done that.                                    |
| 17:48      | Oh, really?                                                                                            |
| 17:49      | Of course.                                                                                             |
| 17:50      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                            |
| 17:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 17:52      | So just last week, a user, I forget their user name, you know, user names are rarely something         |
| 17:57      | that's easily pronounceable, but they developed, or they ran a workshop on starting getting            |
| 18:02      | started with plugin development and walk through with a screencast.                                    |
| 18:06      | So I'll grab that.                                                                                     |
| 18:07      | If you can get us a link to that, I'll put that in the show notes.                                     |
| 18:10      | Absolutely.                                                                                            |
| 18:11      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by TextExpander from our friends at Smile.                |
| 18:15      | Do you ever type the same thing over and over and over again?                                          |
| 18:19      | Whether it's customer support answers, sales emails, or document edits, typing things repetitively     |
| 18:24      | or using copy and paste can be a burden.                                                               |
| 18:26      | That's where TextExpander comes in.                                                                    |
| 18:28      | The TextExpander you and your team can keep your message consistent, save time, and be                 |
| 18:32      | more productive.                                                                                       |
| 18:34      | Be accurate every time.                                                                                |
| 18:36      | The way we work is rapidly changing.                                                                   |
| 18:38      | It won't happen wherever you are by saying more in less time and with less effort using                |
| 18:42      | TextExpander.                                                                                          |
| 18:43      | I use TextExpander for all sorts of things, like correcting common misspellings in URLs                |
| 18:48      | and email addresses, as well as more complex things, like making sure that the contact                 |
| 18:54      | details that I provide to somebody are correct.                                                        |
| 18:57      | And of course, it only contains the information that I want to give to them.                           |
| 19:01      | And as a listener of automators, you can get 20% off your first year.                                  |
| 19:04      | TextExpander.com/podcast to learn more about TextExpander.                                       |
| 19:08      | That's TextExpander.com/podcast.                                                                 |
| 19:11      | Our thanks to TextExpander from Smell for their support of this show and really AFM.                   |
| 19:14      | All right, so in the last segment, we spent some time talking about how to build your                  |
| 19:20      | own tools for [[Obsidian]], but I want to get into the nitty-gritty of actually automating                 |
| 19:23      | inside the application.                                                                                |
| 19:26      | What are some of the automations that you rely upon when you're working inside [[Obsidian]]?               |
| 19:31      | Sure.                                                                                                  |
| 19:32      | So fortunately, I set up this [[Obsidian]] home screen just like last week, or at least published          |
| 19:40      | about it just last week, which outlines really a lot of the stuff that I do.                           |
| 19:43      | And this is on the iPhone and iPad, but I'm using shortcuts to drive a bunch of different              |
| 19:48      | interesting automations that just help hook right into important parts of what I keep                  |
| 19:54      | in [[Obsidian]] and use what's in [[Obsidian]] to dynamically sort of drive what I'm doing                     |
| 19:58      | with those shortcuts, which might sound complicated, but let me give a quick example.                  |
| 20:02      | I've got a shortcut that when I tap it on the home screen, it reads a file, and that                   |
| 20:07      | file is basically a list of projects, which are themselves notes, and then it opens one                |
| 20:12      | of those notes when I select.                                                                          |
| 20:15      | And so the really cool thing about this, and the thing that might not even be demonstrated             |
| 20:19      | that well by the example, is that you're able to keep, so what's happening underneath this             |
| 20:25      | is actually the shortcut is reading the same file that I use to manage all my projects.                |
| 20:30      | It's just a [[Kanban]], it's in [[Obsidian]] as a [[Kanban]] board, just a list of links.                          |
| 20:35      | And when I manage my projects on any platform, Mac or iOS, I'm moving stuff around on that             |
| 20:41      | [[Kanban]].                                                                                                |
| 20:42      | And then because [[Obsidian]] has plain text files underneath, it's really trivial for shortcuts           |
| 20:46      | to then read that list and do something with it.                                                       |
| 20:49      | And so I've got this single source of truth for what's happening in my mind for the projects           |
| 20:55      | that I'm currently engaged in, the things that I pushed off on the back burner and the                 |
| 20:58      | things that I do this week.                                                                            |
| 21:01      | And that shortcut is driven by that single source of truth, and I think that's a really                |
| 21:05      | powerful idea.                                                                                         |
| 21:06      | You know, your notes are maintaining something that's happening in your life, and let's use            |
| 21:10      | that to drive some interesting automations that help you get to it faster.                             |
| 21:15      | I've just spotted Ryan, I was just looking at your home screen again, I've just zoomed                 |
| 21:18      | in, you're using widget pack as well as shortcuts, because obviously widget pack you're creating       |
| 21:22      | from shortcuts.                                                                                        |
| 21:23      | Oh my gosh, this is amazing.                                                                           |
| 21:25      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 21:26      | I have questions.                                                                                      |
| 21:27      | I'll get to those in a second.                                                                         |
| 21:29      | Happy to talk to them.                                                                                 |
| 21:30      | Yeah, I've done a bunch of posts as well on the idea of a status board for your life.                  |
| 21:35      | I think it's a really good idea for people.                                                            |
| 21:37      | And I kind of went on a journey, I was doing it in [[OmniGraffle]], and you know, URL links                |
| 21:43      | for me are always a great automation method to jump or contextually compute.                           |
| 21:49      | But like you, I've kind of landed on [[Obsidian]] as the place for this, because all the data              |
| 21:55      | is there, and that Kanban plugin is very good.                                                         |
| 22:00      | So I do a similar thing, but you've kind of gone a level deeper, because you've made                   |
| 22:04      | a shortcut that reads and interacts with [[Obsidian]] data.                                                |
| 22:09      | The way I normally do this stuff is I will make the shortcut that addresses an [[Obsidian]]                |
| 22:14      | URL or a specific file.                                                                                |
| 22:16      | And I think, you know, the way you've done it is superior, frankly.                                    |
| 22:20      | Well, and it's all thanks to iOS 15, right, and the new files actions, they're way more                |
| 22:24      | powerful than what we had before.                                                                      |
| 22:27      | So thanks to the shortcut scene for building that.                                                     |
| 22:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:30      | And something people don't realise is that [[Obsidian]] is actually very shortcuts friendly,               |
| 22:36      | because, at least for me, because I use the encrypted database function, that means that               |
| 22:42      | the way you store your data with [[Obsidian]] is you literally store it on the local storage               |
| 22:46      | of your phone or your iPad, which is unusual, you know, normally you put data in the iCloud            |
| 22:53      | or the [[Dropbox]] or something like that.                                                                 |
| 22:55      | But if you're using the encrypted database, you actually set the database up on your root,             |
| 23:00      | you know, local storage.                                                                               |
| 23:02      | And that is the most easily addressable space using shortcuts, because it's your space.                |
| 23:06      | It doesn't have to go through some cloud provider.                                                     |
| 23:11      | And that works with both [[Obsidian]] Sync, the paid service that they provide, which is incredibly        |
| 23:15      | fast and secure.                                                                                       |
| 23:17      | But it also works with iCloud Drive, you can do the same thing.                                        |
| 23:20      | And there are some advantages actually to using iCloud Drive for that purpose, because                 |
| 23:23      | it's synced in the background.                                                                         |
| 23:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:25      | So if you've made changes somewhere else, then hopefully the shortcuts will be picking                 |
| 23:29      | up the latest and greatest version of that file.                                                       |
| 23:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:32      | That, as a downside for me, is that, like, I have some of my [[Obsidian]]-related automation               |
| 23:37      | involves things like, you know, doing things with [[Drafts]] and then putting them into [[Obsidian]],          |
| 23:45      | but then they won't sync until I actually open [[Obsidian]], because it doesn't see them                   |
| 23:48      | to run it through its sync engine.                                                                     |
| 23:51      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 23:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:53      | A bit.                                                                                                 |
| 23:54      | And it's hard to do anything about that, because apps are sandboxed on the iPad and iPhone.            |
| 24:00      | I saw, I'm jealous, a little bit of Android.                                                           |
| 24:02      | I recently saw that some Samsung phones have the ability to permanently run apps in the                |
| 24:06      | background.                                                                                            |
| 24:07      | So it's like, so you need to get there.                                                                |
| 24:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:10      | I both love that, but I also love the fact that on iOS, apps can't just run in the background          |
| 24:14      | and see things like Facebook, who were trying to do that thing where they silently run audio           |
| 24:18      | in the background, so that they could still do updates, like that got killed.                          |
| 24:22      | And, you know, some of these things, you can't have it both ways, can you?                             |
| 24:25      | No, you can.                                                                                           |
| 24:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:28      | Although I am a fan of walls of toggles, like if they hid these things behind advanced                 |
| 24:31      | preferences, and even if you had to, you know, do something really strange to get to                   |
| 24:36      | it, I would still love it.                                                                             |
| 24:37      | I think that's the protection there.                                                                   |
| 24:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:39      | Like hidden [[URL Schemes]], I know a couple of app developers have those built into their                 |
| 24:42      | app, so that you can do things like change the default calendar that would be opened,                  |
| 24:46      | but they don't necessarily want to present that to every user, because, you know, people               |
| 24:51      | would change it and then get confused.                                                                 |
| 24:52      | Why doesn't it work?                                                                                   |
| 24:53      | Because you want to install Fantastic Out, that's why it doesn't work.                                 |
| 24:56      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 24:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:58      | There are a lot of great things there with this.                                                       |
| 25:01      | And honestly, I love the fact that [[Obsidian]] is so easy to get things into, because that                |
| 25:08      | for me is what made a click.                                                                           |
| 25:10      | I didn't, unlike David try, Roam, I very briefly for about three minutes tried Craft, I couldn't       |
| 25:17      | get on with the block editor.                                                                          |
| 25:18      | I've never really got on with [[Notion]].                                                                  |
| 25:20      | I love how pretty it is, but it's not available offline, which for me is a killer, because             |
| 25:25      | I, the very least pre-pandemic used to fly a lot, and I was not paying for data on every               |
| 25:30      | single flight that would have been horrendously expensive.                                             |
| 25:34      | So, you know, when I found [[Obsidian]], I was just there going, right, if I'm going to                    |
| 25:38      | use any of these applications, this is the one to use.                                                 |
| 25:42      | And then, wow, yeah, bam, it just solves a lot of problems, surprisingly enough, or                    |
| 25:47      | not surprisingly, really.                                                                              |
| 25:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 25:50      | And I should be clear that a lot of those other apps are really neat and really well-built.            |
| 25:56      | But what I think is different about [[Obsidian]] and a few of the other options, I do think                |
| 26:00      | that [[DEVONthink]] and [[Notion]] are also in this class.                                                  |
| 26:03      | I think of them as environments, I talked earlier about development environments for                   |
| 26:07      | coding, but I've also written some pieces on this idea of an integrated thinking environment.          |
| 26:13      | And what [[Obsidian]] and [[Notion]] and [[DEVONthink]] and some others allow you to do is they're              |
| 26:17      | so customisable, right, they're built with this idea of personalisability in mind.                     |
| 26:22      | And because of that, you're able to build it to match whatever it is you're thinking                   |
| 26:25      | about.                                                                                                 |
| 26:26      | So if you're running a law practice, then being able to actually sort of build in the                  |
| 26:31      | ways you need to work and the kind of information you need to capture straight into the environment,   |
| 26:36      | you can really get to some powerful workflows that way that just aren't possible by taking             |
| 26:41      | another off-the-shelf app and using it.                                                                |
| 26:43      | So I think that's what's neat about [[Obsidian]].                                                          |
| 26:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:47      | For me, this is really what makes it work.                                                             |
| 26:48      | Not only is it, of course, a good application that does exactly what it needs to.                      |
| 26:53      | It's not just that it does exactly what it needs to, it's also that I can extend it.                   |
| 26:57      | And I don't have to extend it by extending it myself, obviously.                                       |
| 27:01      | There is the ability to do that.                                                                       |
| 27:02      | We've talked about creating plugins.                                                                   |
| 27:04      | It's something I've yet to do because every time I go to look to say, oh, did somebody                 |
| 27:08      | do this already?                                                                                       |
| 27:09      | They did.                                                                                              |
| 27:10      | And so I just end up installing it.                                                                    |
| 27:11      | And some of the time, it's you, Ryan, which I'm very pleased about, and some of the time,              |
| 27:14      | it's other people.                                                                                     |
| 27:15      | I was just saying before the show, the advanced tables plugin in [[Obsidian]] is so good because           |
| 27:22      | you create a new line in the table and it just automatically updates the markdown to                   |
| 27:26      | space everything out and things like that.                                                             |
| 27:29      | And that, for me, is the sort of things that make it a much better app because not only                |
| 27:35      | do I have all the features that I need with the brilliance of markdown, every time I need              |
| 27:40      | something new, either it's there or I do have the ability to create it myself.                         |
| 27:44      | And it's not just us and our opinions about this.                                                      |
| 27:48      | There's over 350 plugins developed since the API was published a year ago.                             |
| 27:52      | That's 350 plugins at a year.                                                                          |
| 27:55      | And a couple of them have over 100,000 downloads.                                                      |
| 27:57      | So this is, we're talking about an extension of an app having 100,000 downloads is pretty              |
| 28:01      | impeccable.                                                                                            |
| 28:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 28:03      | And I really think that it's just the automation element that makes [[Obsidian]] such a nerd trap          |
| 28:10      | for all of us.                                                                                         |
| 28:11      | I mean, if you go on the NPO forums, there's a lot of people there that prefer Kraft.                  |
| 28:16      | And I get it because Kraft is more of a native app experience.                                         |
| 28:22      | It's more Mac friendly, even though it's really built for iOS and iPad, whereas [[Obsidian]] is            |
| 28:28      | a different animal, but it is the automation element.                                                  |
| 28:32      | It's the ability to internalise, add templates.                                                        |
| 28:35      | It's the ability to add a [[Kanban]] plugin and build your own personal project management                 |
| 28:41      | system into the app.                                                                                   |
| 28:42      | It's just like, it's the way that the thing morphs into whatever you need it to be.                    |
| 28:47      | And if you want to spend a weekend getting comfortable with JavaScript, the fact that                  |
| 28:52      | you can build your own features into it, I mean, that is crazy.                                        |
| 28:55      | And then they brought it to the iPad and iPhone.                                                       |
| 28:59      | And I never expected this, but they brought the entire plugin architecture with it.                    |
| 29:03      | So those cool plugins you make for the Mac work on the iPhone and the iPad too, it is                  |
| 29:08      | bananas.                                                                                               |
| 29:09      | I was saying before we started recording that the three of us could probably do a five hour            |
| 29:13      | podcast today about [[Obsidian]].                                                                          |
| 29:15      | I guess we shouldn't do that though.                                                                   |
| 29:18      | Maybe next time, David, maybe, maybe one last point, just because this is the automators               |
| 29:22      | and because we do love [[URL Schemes]], that there is a recent plugin actually built for [[Obsidian]]          |
| 29:27      | October that creates, lets you create your own [[URL Schemes]] for [[Obsidian]] or launch your                 |
| 29:33      | own [[URL Schemes]] from [[Obsidian]], sorry.                                                                  |
| 29:36      | And so you can take the content of a note and ship it out to shortcuts really easily                   |
| 29:39      | with that plugin.                                                                                      |
| 29:41      | And I think it's named self-descriptively, I think it's called [[URL Schemes]], but I'll                   |
| 29:46      | try to find a note link for the show notes.                                                            |
| 29:48      | Thank you, that would be wonderful.                                                                    |
| 29:49      | Thank you for sharing that.                                                                            |
| 29:50      | I have not seen this yet and I need that.                                                              |
| 29:52      | I think you just wrecked my weekend, Ryan.                                                             |
| 29:55      | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 29:56      | Yep, yep, I lost last weekend to my blog, I'm losing this weekend to [[Obsidian]], I am fine               |
| 30:01      | with this.                                                                                             |
| 30:02      | This is...                                                                                             |
| 30:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:05      | But like even with URLs though, it does have, like if you go into the [[Obsidian]] forums,                 |
| 30:09      | I had cooked together this really, this really creaky looking [[Keyboard Maestro]] script to               |
| 30:16      | pull a URL link and build it out of [[Obsidian]] before they had it, then one day they just                |
| 30:21      | added the feature of, you know, get shareable link.                                                    |
| 30:26      | But I have added that to the keyboard shortcut, this is a very basic automation, but Command           |
| 30:30      | U for me in [[Obsidian]] gets me the URL link of the current note, and then all of a sudden                |
| 30:35      | I'm dropping that into my [[DEVONthink]] database, my OmniFocus project, and all of a sudden my         |
| 30:40      | computer just dances around a project like nobody's business, and it's because they put                |
| 30:45      | features like that in.                                                                                 |
| 30:46      | It's a beautiful thing.                                                                                |
| 30:48      | By the way, did you know that there's an advanced URI plugin which extends the [[Obsidian]] URL            |
| 30:54      | scheme?                                                                                                |
| 30:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 30:56      | And it actually has a feature, it's in the configuration, so go into preferences and                   |
| 31:01      | click on advanced URI, but you can enable a unique identifier code for advanced URI,                   |
| 31:08      | which can help if you've got a lot of notes with the same names.                                       |
| 31:11      | Yes, yes, because I end up doing that.                                                                 |
| 31:14      | I've downloaded that one, I haven't spent time with it yet, but that one's on my list,                 |
| 31:18      | but yeah, it's just, it's hard to keep up with all these plugins.                                      |
| 31:21      | I mean, I've been preaching about building your own, but honestly, keeping up with the                 |
| 31:24      | ones other people are building is tough enough.                                                        |
| 31:27      | Yeah, it's pretty wild.                                                                                |
| 31:29      | It is, but also you don't necessarily actually need to, it's so tempting to go, oh, I need             |
| 31:33      | to stay on top of this stuff, but I've found with these things, as much as it's cool to                |
| 31:38      | know, wow, this is a cool thing I can do, that does end up being a lot of rabbit holes                 |
| 31:42      | for me, where I then end up accidentally going and spending a weekend updating my blog when            |
| 31:47      | really what I intended to do was the first 10 minutes and add a search, and that was                   |
| 31:52      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 31:53      | And guess what?                                                                                        |
| 31:54      | I shipped that, and then two days later, I've done a whole bunch of other things as                    |
| 31:57      | well, but what I really like is when I then go and search for things, like being surprised             |
| 32:02      | by this stuff and finding things, you know, then rather than having something show up                  |
| 32:07      | and then my brain immediately starts going, how can I fit this into my workflow?                       |
| 32:11      | I find especially automation-wise, it's better to wait until you find a need to solve before           |
| 32:17      | you try to use the tool instead of trying to shoehorn a tool that maybe doesn't fit                    |
| 32:20      | quite yet into your life.                                                                              |
| 32:23      | Are you guys using any automation workflows on mobile to get text into [[Obsidian]]?                       |
| 32:29      | Because I find the actual process of adding text in [[Obsidian]] to be pretty tedious on mobile,           |
| 32:36      | you know, because you've got to get the app open, you've got to get to a note.                         |
| 32:40      | I greatly prefer using [[Drafts]] for capture still, and then I just create a little [[Drafts]]               |
| 32:47      | action that saves the note to a folder in [[Obsidian]], and then it's there for me.                        |
| 32:51      | I was curious, how are you guys handling that?                                                         |
| 32:54      | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 32:55      | Is this a setup?                                                                                       |
| 32:56      | Because I just launched a plugin that helps with that.                                                 |
| 32:57      | I didn't know you did, right?                                                                          |
| 32:59      | Honestly, I can't keep up.                                                                             |
| 33:01      | So actually, this is a setup.                                                                          |
| 33:03      | How is it about this plugin, Ryan?                                                                     |
| 33:04      | I totally know.                                                                                        |
| 33:05      | Everybody just pretend you didn't hear what I just admitted.                                           |
| 33:08      | No, Ryan, I'm totally aware of this, and now could you please explain?                                 |
| 33:12      | Ah, okay.                                                                                              |
| 33:13      | Okay, yeah, yeah.                                                                                      |
| 33:14      | So Lumberjack is a new plugin, and the whole idea that I was jealous of [[Drafts]], right?                 |
| 33:18      | I love the idea of [[Drafts]].                                                                             |
| 33:20      | I've certainly used it as a sort of scratch pad for many years, but I could never get my               |
| 33:24      | head around the idea of putting a bunch of ideas or thinking in one place and then having              |
| 33:28      | to move it somewhere else, just as a sort of fundamental law of using the app.                         |
| 33:32      | And now I know that Agile Tortoise has built out a lot of new features that support just               |
| 33:37      | keeping the text in the app, which is great, fantastic.                                                |
| 33:40      | But I'm sticking with [[Obsidian]], and I was jealous of that workflow where you tap the                   |
| 33:45      | [[Drafts]] icon, and then you're able to write within seconds, right?                                      |
| 33:48      | And so Lumberjack is a plugin I just built and released for [[Obsidian]] that has two functions.           |
| 33:54      | They're both URL-scheme-based, and the idea is to write, if you write [[Obsidian]] colon slash             |
| 33:59      | slash log, that's why it's Lumberjack because you're logging, it will automatically open               |
| 34:04      | your daily note in [[Obsidian]] and create a list item of whatever prefix you want underneath              |
| 34:10      | whatever heading you want, and you can just start writing right away.                                  |
| 34:13      | It loads the edit mode, and it loads your keyboard right in front of you, so you're                    |
| 34:17      | ready to go.                                                                                           |
| 34:18      | So it doesn't work just or exactly as perfectly as [[Drafts]] does, Agile Tortoise definitely benefits     |
| 34:24      | from the native text stack that [[Drafts]] is built on.                                                    |
| 34:28      | And so, for instance, if you haven't opened [[Obsidian]] in a while, it might need to load                 |
| 34:31      | that kind of thing.                                                                                    |
| 34:32      | Hopefully, you don't forget your thought during that moment, but if you're opening [[Obsidian]]            |
| 34:35      | a lot, it works really well.                                                                           |
| 34:36      | So that's Lumberjack.                                                                                  |
| 34:37      | Is there a possibility to pass some data into this via a parameter?                                    |
| 34:46      | So I can imagine that then I might actually, because what I do at the moment, which for                |
| 34:52      | full disclosure, I do not recommend this, but this is what I'm doing because this is                   |
| 34:56      | what I was doing before I started using [[Obsidian]] Sync.                                                 |
| 34:58      | I actually have [[Drafts]] right into [[Dropbox]] folders.                                                     |
| 35:06      | I have one computer which is set up, which syncs my [[Dropbox]] folder with [[Obsidian]] and [[Obsidian]]          |
| 35:12      | Syncs.                                                                                                 |
| 35:13      | So double syncing, and just be very clear, if you want to do this one computer, do not                 |
| 35:18      | do this on more than one computer, that will break all of the things.                                  |
| 35:21      | One computer only, everything else is using [[Obsidian]] Sync.                                             |
| 35:24      | So what happens then is that one computer goes, new stuff in [[Dropbox]], pull it into [[Obsidian]],           |
| 35:30      | and then, of course, it ends up in [[Obsidian]] Sync.                                                      |
| 35:32      | And this helps because I have some things which just append stuff to lists and things                  |
| 35:37      | like that, and that's very easy to do via [[Drafts]], of course, with the append action                    |
| 35:43      | inside of the [[Dropbox]] actions.                                                                         |
| 35:45      | But of course, I want the data in [[Obsidian]].                                                            |
| 35:50      | That's where the data lives.                                                                           |
| 35:51      | That's the right place for the data.                                                                   |
| 35:52      | The data shouldn't live in [[Drafts]] forever.                                                             |
| 35:55      | But yeah, I'm not sure that what I've got there is really a good solution.                             |
| 36:00      | I should spend a bit more time with the [[URL Schemes]], in particular, the advanced one,                  |
| 36:05      | the advanced plugin, because I've yet to really dive into that, and I think that that would            |
| 36:10      | probably solve the problem.                                                                            |
| 36:11      | Though, of course, the beauty of the [[Dropbox]] action is it can run entirely in the background,          |
| 36:15      | and then the draft just disappears, because I do still pretty much open [[Drafts]] to capture              |
| 36:19      | most things, which is good.                                                                            |
| 36:22      | But I should also look into making a PopClip extension for [[Obsidian]].                                  |
| 36:25      | Maybe somebody already did that.                                                                       |
| 36:26      | Yeah, I haven't seen one, but I wouldn't be surprised.                                                 |
| 36:29      | I will say, so I was thinking about adding parameters, and then I held back because                    |
| 36:34      | I really want the plugin to be as simple as possible.                                                  |
| 36:36      | I want people to recognise that it's just one word, just write log, and that's it.                     |
| 36:41      | But I'm playing with the idea of adding parameters, because I think it would be a fun sort of          |
| 36:43      | secret feature.                                                                                        |
| 36:45      | But even outside of that, Rosa, I would consider using base shortcuts, files actions.                  |
| 36:50      | I don't know how well you can write to [[Dropbox]] with that, but I actually have a simple make            |
| 36:54      | note shortcut.                                                                                         |
| 36:55      | I can share it in the notes, and it runs entirely in the background, and will append whatever          |
| 37:00      | you say out loud to your daily note.                                                                   |
| 37:02      | Well, on my iPhone, of course, everything is talking to just the [[Dropbox]] API, but the                  |
| 37:11      | [[Drafts]] is talking to the [[Dropbox]] API, but the actual [[Obsidian]] application is talking                   |
| 37:15      | to [[Obsidian]] Sync, which is then saved on my phone.                                                     |
| 37:18      | So that is available in the Files app.                                                                 |
| 37:21      | I would just have to make sure my draft section knows, at least for the time being, whether            |
| 37:25      | I'm on my Mac or my iPhone or iPad, which fortunately, draft sections, you can say this step should    |
| 37:31      | run on macOS, and this step should run on iOS, and you can uncheck it in each.                         |
| 37:36      | So I can actually have two steps inside of the action, and just say one of these is for                |
| 37:39      | macOS, one of these is for iOS, because macOS, of course, the current release, as we record,           |
| 37:45      | before we release, Monterey will have been released, but I'm not upgrading to that for                 |
| 37:51      | a little while after release, it's just because I don't want to break all of the things at             |
| 37:54      | the same time.                                                                                         |
| 37:55      | Yeah, I haven't touched it for that reason.                                                            |
| 37:58      | But yeah, that's brilliant, what you're talking about is brilliant.                                    |
| 38:03      | And Shortcuts now has something similar on iOS and iPad, where you can detect device really            |
| 38:10      | easily.                                                                                                |
| 38:11      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 38:12      | So you can also do something similar there if you're doing something different on an iPad              |
| 38:14      | or an iPhone.                                                                                          |
| 38:15      | Yes, yeah, which until all of the apps support all of the actions in Shortcuts, we're going            |
| 38:20      | to need to do anyway.                                                                                  |
| 38:21      | And as it is, you have to do with some things, because if you set up a vibrate option and              |
| 38:25      | then you try and run that shortcut on macOS, it just goes, I don't know what to do, I'm                |
| 38:29      | going to stop here.                                                                                    |
| 38:30      | It's like, come on, macOS, you could realise that you can't vibrate, or maybe you can                  |
| 38:34      | just do something silly with the speakers.                                                             |
| 38:36      | Yeah, I do think it'd be cool if they max out the fans a little bit and then my Mac                    |
| 38:40      | shook back and forth on your desk or something, that would be fun.                                     |
| 38:44      | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| 38:45      | This episode of Automated is brought to you by Stripe.                                                 |
| 38:49      | Many leaders of adaptive businesses choose Stripe as their payments platform.                          |
| 38:53      | Because with Stripe, businesses can easily optimise their payments infrastructure, simplify            |
| 38:57      | their expansion plans, and create new revenue streams, all to help them grow and initiate              |
| 39:02      | change rather than having to react to it.                                                              |
| 39:04      | In fact, businesses such as Shopify, Postmates, and Twilio use Stripe to power their global            |
| 39:10      | payments.                                                                                              |
| 39:11      | And to add to that list of companies is Relay FM.                                                      |
| 39:14      | Relay's trusted Stripe to manage payments is 2016.                                                     |
| 39:17      | It's a huge benefit that they can accept more than 135 different currencies and payment                |
| 39:22      | methods, which means more time can be spent on hosting and prepping for shows, while Stripe            |
| 39:26      | helps to handle the payments.                                                                          |
| 39:28      | Stripe ranked highest for strategy and current offering in the 2020 Forrester Wave Report              |
| 39:32      | on merchant payment providers.                                                                         |
| 39:34      | And their current offering is so comprehensive and versatile, with Stripe's products                   |
| 39:38      | powering payments for a wide variety of businesses from online and in-person retailers to subscription |
| 39:44      | businesses, software platforms, and marketplaces, as well as everything in between.                    |

| 39:56      | Our thanks to Stripe for their support of this show and Relay FM.                                      |
| 40:00      | Ryan, you had said that you have a 10-month-old.                                                       |
| 40:04      | Congratulations.                                                                                       |
| 40:05      | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 40:06      | And I was curious, someone that has an eye for automation like you, are you bringing                   |
| 40:12      | those skills to bear on the parenting?                                                                 |
| 40:15      | Yeah, as much as possible.                                                                             |
| 40:17      | All right, we can't automate diaper changes yet, but you can do a lot of other things.                 |
| 40:26      | And so actually, this relates really deeply to the last episode as of recording the micro              |
| 40:32      | automations episode of automators, because a lot of these things are really simple.                    |
| 40:36      | But I think I really wanted to talk about this topic on automators, because if anybody                 |
| 40:40      | listening is a new parent or is about to be a parent or knows a new parent, this is an                 |
| 40:45      | untapped area of helping with the new parent lifestyle.                                                |
| 40:50      | The Venn diagram that's overlapping, that overlaps parenting blogs with automation, it's not a         |
| 40:57      | thick wedge there.                                                                                     |
| 40:58      | But it should be.                                                                                      |
| 40:59      | It doesn't exist at all.                                                                               |
| 41:01      | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                                    |
| 41:02      | There is actually a great site called Fathercraft where they review a lot of parenting tech,           |
| 41:07      | but they also do a lot of software stuff.                                                              |
| 41:11      | But thinking, a lot of these micro automations are actually incredibly useful for the harried,         |
| 41:21      | distracted, overly exhausted life of somebody dealing with a newborn.                                  |
| 41:26      | And so that's why I wanted to talk about this here, because they're so basic that you're               |
| 41:31      | going to laugh at them.                                                                                |
| 41:32      | And I have a great story, I think, or at least an entertaining story at my expense.                    |
| 41:36      | But the fundamental idea is for potential parents or new parents to think about how                    |
| 41:44      | using little tiny automations can take things off your mind when you're already just so                |
| 41:47      | distracted.                                                                                            |
| 41:48      | So you want to hear the story?                                                                         |
| 41:49      | Go for it.                                                                                             |
| 41:50      | Tell us.                                                                                               |
| 41:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 41:52      | Okay, so I don't know if you've, as Merlin Mann put in the recent episode of Back to Work,              |
| 41:57      | if you've ever owned or leased a kid, you'll know that they're not supposed to be, that                |
| 42:02      | sleep is kind of important.                                                                            |
| 42:04      | That sleep is fragile, it's fragile for everyone, but when you get the newborn down and she's          |
| 42:09      | finally asleep, you really want to make sure that she stays asleep and you don't do anything           |
| 42:13      | to distract.                                                                                           |
| 42:14      | So you're creeping out of the room when you have this map in your head of every single                 |
| 42:18      | object on the nightstand, so you don't knock anything over, and you're trying to sneak                 |
| 42:23      | into bed and so on.                                                                                    |
| 42:24      | So it's really sort of fragile.                                                                        |
| 42:27      | And hopefully I'm not traumatising anybody who's recently gone through this, because                   |
| 42:31      | I definitely have some horror stories in my mind of bumping into something.                            |
| 42:36      | Just what Ryan, Ryan, just wait till they get old enough to have Lego.                                 |
| 42:39      | That's all I'm saying.                                                                                 |
| 42:40      | Then it's like, navigate the room without stepping on one.                                             |
| 42:43      | Be grateful you don't live in the UK with our plugs.                                                   |
| 42:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 42:47      | Yeah, I hear you, I mean, there's more to come, I know.                                                |
| 42:53      | But for those first few months anyway, it was still very scary.                                        |
| 42:58      | But okay, so I have HomePods and I just talked about not wanting to bump into things, right?          |
| 43:04      | And I was going to bed at night and we had just gotten the newborn down an hour ago.                   |
| 43:08      | We've been really lucky.                                                                               |
| 43:09      | She sleeps really well.                                                                                |
| 43:11      | But I was putting away my phone on the nightstand and what did I do but tap accidentally, tap          |
| 43:16      | the top of the HomePod.                                                                               |
| 43:18      | And what blares, but like 60% volume, metal or whatever I'd been listening to before.                  |
| 43:24      | And I immediately could tap it repeatedly and it's kind of slow to respond.                            |
| 43:30      | So you tap it once and then it doesn't necessarily shut off right away as you tap it again and         |
| 43:34      | then it shuts off and then it turns on again.                                                          |
| 43:35      | So you can imagine the moment that we were having, me and my wife were having.                         |
| 43:40      | The amazing thing is that the baby didn't wake up.                                                     |
| 43:43      | Phew.                                                                                                  |
| 43:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 43:45      | But it still led to elevated heart rates and staying awake for the next hour panicking                 |
| 43:48      | about what I'd just done.                                                                              |
| 43:51      | And that was the first time I did it, but I actually did it a second time.                             |
| 43:54      | Yes, I can imagine that as somebody who's recently discovered that when she whispers                   |
| 44:00      | to her HomePod in the evening, it is currently yelling back at me.                                    |
| 44:04      | So I'm there and I'm really tired.                                                                     |
| 44:06      | I'm just getting into bed and I'm saying really quietly, like, you know, turn off the                  |
| 44:09      | light and then it's okay.                                                                              |
| 44:11      | I have turned off the light.                                                                           |
| 44:13      | Thank you.                                                                                             |
| 44:14      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 44:15      | Anyway, thank you.                                                                                     |
| 44:16      | You're too cheerful.                                                                                   |
| 44:17      | Whoever programmed that capacitive touch trigger on those HomePods, I think that guy went             |
| 44:22      | to lunch too early that day because they are so sensitive.                                             |
| 44:26      | They're both way too sensitive, but also too slow to respond.                                          |
| 44:31      | And then when they, because of that, it feels like they're not sensitive enough.                       |
| 44:34      | Like I'm not quite sure what's going on with them.                                                     |
| 44:37      | Maybe this is the reason why the HomePod isn't actually available for sale anymore.                   |
| 44:41      | Maybe that's it.                                                                                       |
| 44:42      | They decided that they needed to update that sensor and they've maybe secretly fixed it                |
| 44:45      | in the new HomePod minis.                                                                             |
| 44:46      | Maybe.                                                                                                 |
| 44:47      | Maybe the colourful ones.                                                                               |
| 44:50      | So before we get away from the, from the story, there is a solution to this, right?                    |
| 44:54      | I run an automation now that at a certain time of night automatically sets the volume                  |
| 44:59      | of all the HomePods to zero.                                                                          |
| 45:00      | You can't control the voice volume that way.                                                           |
| 45:01      | Like Rose just said that there's actually a bug that prevents the HomePods from remembering           |
| 45:05      | the voice volume.                                                                                      |
| 45:06      | But at least if you tap it or accidentally hit play on your phone or something, it's                   |
| 45:09      | not going to show or play music at extreme volumes after you've gotten the baby to bed.                |
| 45:15      | Yes, that is something I actually do as well.                                                          |
| 45:18      | I have it automatically do it in the evening and it does it in the morning as well.                    |
| 45:22      | Because so if I'm playing, you know, music overnight, then it's usually that I want                    |
| 45:26      | it fairly quiet in my bedroom and nowhere else.                                                        |
| 45:29      | But in the morning, I would then want the music to be everywhere again.                                |
| 45:33      | So I actually have that sorted.                                                                        |
| 45:34      | I've got a bonus trick for you here, automation-wise Ryan, which is also on your iPhone, have           |
| 45:41      | an automation run and set the audio destination of your iPhone to your iPhone or something             |
| 45:49      | instead of to the HomePods, just because that way it's not going to like try and play                 |
| 45:53      | somewhere and you're not going to be confused why it's not playing.                                    |
| 45:56      | And it is.                                                                                             |
| 45:57      | It's just playing at 0% volume to a HomePod.                                                          |
| 45:59      | So that's something else I use as well.                                                                |
| 46:01      | I have a whole series of automations related to audio output.                                          |
| 46:04      | So maybe that can be used as well.                                                                     |
| 46:06      | Yeah, I did that once.                                                                                 |
| 46:07      | I was playing audio and I had my headphones on and it wasn't playing and I kept turning                |
| 46:12      | the volume up until I realised that I was blasting a podcast into the HomePod in the                  |
| 46:17      | next room and my kids were very upset with me.                                                         |
| 46:20      | So yeah, I get it.                                                                                     |
| 46:21      | How are you triggering that automation, Ryan?                                                          |
| 46:24      | Yeah, just with the Automation tab and shortcuts.                                                      |
| 46:27      | Yeah, the timer.                                                                                       |
| 46:28      | Is that a [[HomeKit]] automation that you're using or is that a personal automation?                       |
| 46:33      | Personal automation.                                                                                   |
| 46:34      | Yeah, just that.                                                                                       |
| 46:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:36      | I think it runs at seven o'clock at night.                                                             |
| 46:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:40      | I mean, I do this as well with the Home app.                                                           |
| 46:42      | I actually have a scene set up in [[HomeKit]] because, or I've got two scenes for this,                    |
| 46:48      | of course, because one of them is for, you know, turn the volume down everywhere, but                  |
| 46:52      | not so much in the bedroom and then one of it's turn the volume to the same level everywhere.          |
| 46:56      | And so I did this with a scene in the Home app, which you can create scenes in the shortcuts           |
| 47:04      | app as well.                                                                                           |
| 47:06      | And what you can do there is you just select your accessories, which would be your Home                |
| 47:09      | pods.                                                                                                  |
| 47:10      | And then under media, it defaults to audio, play audio, but you can actually just say                  |
| 47:14      | adjust volume only, and then you can set a custom volume level.                                        |
| 47:19      | But one word of warning if you do this, which, you know, is a bonus and a failing at the               |
| 47:26      | same time.                                                                                             |
| 47:27      | If you do this, it will group all of the devices that you have in that scene together when             |
| 47:32      | this action runs.                                                                                      |
| 47:33      | Now this can be a good thing because it means that you group everything together with a                |
| 47:37      | scene and you play, and then all of those Home pods play, but that can also be a curse                 |
| 47:41      | because they all play together the next time.                                                          |
| 47:46      | So the way around that is a scene per Home pod or per audio grouping that you actually                 |
| 47:52      | want to keep.                                                                                          |
| 47:54      | And that is not ideal, but I mean, it depends on what you want.                                        |
| 47:58      | So yeah, that is, that's how I do it, but I should possibly look into the personal                     |
| 48:03      | automations for the nighttime one, actually, I can't believe I didn't think of that.                   |
| 48:07      | Yeah, it's definitely saved my butt in the future, or since I changed it, because I'm                  |
| 48:14      | sure I tapped it accidentally more than once.                                                          |
| 48:16      | Of course, I could also just move the Home pod or something, but that's too easy.                      |
| 48:19      | Yes, you could move the Home pod.                                                                      |
| 48:21      | You could also set up an automation that when you start playing audio on a Home pod, after             |
| 48:25      | 7pm, it immediately pauses it, but that seems like it's very prone to error.                           |
| 48:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 48:31      | Right, and that's a great point is the flip of this is being aware of all the automations              |
| 48:35      | you set up.                                                                                            |
| 48:36      | I remember recently I was getting frustrated because I was playing music in the morning                |
| 48:39      | and then it would get turned down to 30% volume, and I thought that my wife was changing, she          |
| 48:44      | was annoyed at whatever I was listening to or something, but now of course it was me                   |
| 48:47      | being stupid and forgetting that I had an automation set up to reset the volume so that                |
| 48:52      | it goes back from being 0% to 30%, like 7.30 in the morning.                                           |
| 48:56      | I was erroneously angry at my wife, so I apologise to her.                                             |
| 49:02      | Yes, knowing when you've made a mistake and it's affecting, and then you blame somebody                |
| 49:06      | else for doing the thing, it's quite important.                                                        |
| 49:10      | Yeah, I find as automators, if you ever find your tech behaving strangely, you should definitely       |
| 49:17      | take a look at your shortcuts app, especially that automations tab, because it is really               |
| 49:22      | easy to have them bump into each other in ways you don't expect.                                       |
| 49:27      | Probably blame yourself before you blame others, if you're this geeky.                                 |
| 49:31      | Yes, this is the problem with living alone, I have nobody else to blame.                               |
| 49:34      | For a while I was fostering a cat and it was really easy to blame her for stuff, and it                |
| 49:38      | turned out it was actually her some of the time, especially the kitchen tap turning on,                |
| 49:43      | she was staring at me going, that was definitely not me, no so much, I had it on video, it             |
| 49:48      | was her, and she did the most inelegant flump into the sink as she fell off the kitchen                |
| 49:53      | windows all that time, but a lot of the time it was me, though the tail on the HomePod                |
| 49:59      | triggering audio while I was podcasting, that was pretty much the same thing as yours,                 |
| 50:05      | Brian, only of course with mine, it was considerably less disastrous consequences.                     |
| 50:10      | All right, lay some more parenting automation on this.                                                 |
| 50:14      | Sure, so a fun one that I actually wrote about on the MPU forum was the go time shortcut,              |
| 50:20      | which you're waiting for the day to arrive when babies do, and so you don't want to stress             |
| 50:26      | about how many families, of course it's COVID times, so nobody's here with us, we have to              |
| 50:31      | tell everybody everything all the time, and so I created this little shortcut that got                 |
| 50:36      | the directions to the hospital and messaged all of the families and did a couple of other              |
| 50:43      | things, and I can't remember exactly what, and then the most important part was it started             |
| 50:46      | to play the mission impossible theme off of the iPhone, so there is a bit of intensity                 |
| 50:52      | to the moment of trying to rush out the door, so that one was kind of fun, although it wasn't          |
| 50:58      | necessarily that practical, but a few of the others that were super practical, and again               |
| 51:02      | they're more examples of micro-automation than they are of anything else, but a laundry                |
| 51:07      | shortcut, it's so important to have some Siri friendly shortcuts that actually are heard               |
| 51:14      | when you yell it out at the top of your lungs over crying on a HomePod, and so I have this            |
| 51:19      | shortcut, it's simply called laundry, and it just creates a persistent reminder using                  |
| 51:23      | do for an hour from now to go take the laundry out of the washer and put it in the dryer.              |
| 51:29      | Parenting is, new baby parenting means doing laundry like four times a day, so this thing              |
| 51:34      | has been activated many, many times. Yes, yeah, I like that because that is something,                 |
| 51:40      | I mean, I have an over-complicated version of this, which I have some plugs doing power                |
| 51:46      | monitoring connected to my washer and dryer, fortunately, the ones that I've got are rated             |
| 51:51      | for that, and I have [[Home Assistant]] watching them going through the different stages, so               |
| 51:56      | if I look at my [[Home Assistant]] dashboard, I can see what stage it's in, and the pit that               |
| 52:00      | I need to hook up next is a sensor, a door sensor on the washer and dryer door, so it                  |
| 52:04      | knows automatically once I've opened it, so it can then, hopefully, fingers crossed go                 |
| 52:09      | in and remove the task to take the stuff out of the machine, and yeah, but I think honestly,           |
| 52:15      | a timer is the correct solution for the vast majority of people. For me, it was a case                 |
| 52:20      | of, but I really want to see how far I can go with this, which sometimes is a good reason              |
| 52:24      | to automate and sometimes is not such a great reason, it really depends.                               |
| 52:27      | I'm jealous that sounds like a lot of fun. I would think another good micro-automation                 |
| 52:31      | for a new parent would be various forms of photo sharing, whether it be to select message              |
| 52:38      | group or email list or something, because when you have a new baby, everybody wants pictures.          |
| 52:44      | Yeah, and to be honest, we haven't figured out a great solution for that. I do think                   |
| 52:49      | if we'd gotten everybody onto a shared iCloud photo library, that would have been the best             |
| 52:53      | thing, but we just haven't figured it out. I do have a simple send to the fam shortcut                 |
| 52:57      | that will take the photo that I choose and send it to an iMessage group for two sets                   |
| 53:03      | of families and send it to a WhatsApp group for a third set of families, and that definitely           |
| 53:08      | has saved my me time quite a few times in a week.                                                      |
| 53:12      | Yeah, I wish there was an automation for publishing to iCloud, because that is something you can       |
| 53:16      | do so you don't have to share the library with people, you can just publish things.                    |
| 53:21      | Of course, I'm not sure whether or not that comes with the option to password protected                |
| 53:27      | but if that could be automated, that would be really cool.                                             |
| 53:31      | The other thing that I've done for my parents is actually the Synology software, the photo             |
| 53:37      | station inside of that, that can share albums, and so their albums are shared with me, with            |
| 53:41      | my grandparents, my uncle, which means that all of the photos that my dad went back and                |
| 53:47      | digitised, of course, are there, which is a huge amount of family history dating back                  |
| 53:50      | to the 1950s, and it's all shared with all of us, which is amazing, though it doesn't                  |
| 53:55      | come with a notification of my dad just added 50,000 photos, go check it out.                          |
| 54:00      | Fortunately, he's not adding so many anymore.                                                          |
| 54:03      | Although I would say those shared libraries are, I realise it's not really automation,                 |
| 54:07      | but that is a really good solution for this problem if you have a family in the Apple                  |
| 54:12      | ecosystem, and that kind of just solves the problem, you save it to the shared library                 |
| 54:17      | and then everybody gets it, even the rudimentary commenting system Apple has put in place is           |
| 54:22      | iPhone good enough.                                                                                    |
| 54:25      | Yeah, it's on my to-do list to figure it out, because we're going to be doing this for a               |
| 54:30      | long time.                                                                                             |
| 54:31      | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                                    |
| 54:32      | I definitely want a single solution.                                                                   |
| 54:34      | Yeah, you set it up and you put their names in, and they get an invite, and the trick                  |
| 54:39      | is hopefully the other people on the other end are technically savvy enough to click                   |
| 54:43      | the accept button and understand how to get it, and by default, the iPhone gives them                  |
| 54:49      | notifications.                                                                                         |
| 54:50      | And we've got so many of these with the new babies in my family that they fill them up                 |
| 54:55      | and they have to start after two or three years, they have volume two of the shared                    |
| 55:00      | library because it takes so many pictures.                                                             |
| 55:02      | Amazing.                                                                                               |
| 55:03      | They even have my daughter, my older daughter, who's off to college.                                   |
| 55:06      | She has one about her college adventures, and she puts pictures in there just to kind                  |
| 55:11      | of placate her parents, and we enjoy looking at them and seeing how she's doing and making             |
| 55:18      | sure she's eating.                                                                                     |
| 55:19      | That's such a nice idea.                                                                               |
| 55:20      | You know, all that stuff.                                                                              |
| 55:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:22      | No, that's such a nice idea, and it's a neat example of maybe the next step of social                  |
| 55:28      | media too, right?                                                                                      |
| 55:29      | These are all really private social media channels for people.                                         |
| 55:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:33      | Amen.                                                                                                  |
| 55:34      | That's a really exciting development.                                                                  |
| 55:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:36      | What about, are there some parenting challenges that you want to automate that you have and            |
| 55:40      | other than diapers, of course?                                                                         |
| 55:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:43      | No, that's a great question.                                                                           |
| 55:45      | I mean, I'm curious about other people's solutions to the photo sharing thing because                  |
| 55:49      | not everybody in our family is on Apple devices.                                                       |
| 55:53      | I mean, I did just look at that actually, Ryan, because I was curious, and it does say                 |
| 55:57      | actually here, you can even share albums with friends and family who don't use iCloud.                 |
| 56:02      | Just open the shared album you created, go to the people tab, and turn on public website.              |
| 56:07      | Your photos are published to a website that anyone can see in an up-to-date web browser.               |
| 56:11      | So of course, there is a little bit of security to this in the obscurity of the URL, but I             |
| 56:17      | presume anybody that comes across that link can use it.                                                |
| 56:20      | But yeah, fingers crossed, that might actually solve part of your problem.                             |
| 56:24      | That's something to think about.                                                                       |
| 56:26      | The public web is definitely something I'd want to avoid, but there's got to be a solution.            |
| 56:30      | There has to be somewhere.                                                                             |
| 56:31      | I mean, I probably end up looking at the Synology stuff myself, but I'm aware that for a lot           |
| 56:36      | of people setting up a Synology and connecting it and everything is probably overkill for              |
| 56:40      | you, but it is a solution that definitely works and keeps the photos physically at home                |
| 56:46      | for you, which is always a nice bonus.                                                                 |
| 56:49      | Yeah, I should look into it.                                                                           |
| 56:50      | I'm going to tell you about your future of automated parenting, Ryan, because you have                 |
| 56:55      | told me your dear little daughter is 10 months old.                                                    |
| 56:58      | Pretty soon, if not already, she's going to start booking it across your house, right?                 |
| 57:05      | So I see in Ryan's future the acquisition of some motion sensors and some home kit automation          |
| 57:14      | tools.                                                                                                 |
| 57:15      | So you can find your child when she goes missing.                                                      |
| 57:17      | Yes, some cameras.                                                                                     |
| 57:18      | I think we need to have you back in a couple of years and have the toddler automation                  |
| 57:23      | episode, because I feel like a guy like Ryan is going to nail this stuff down.                         |
| 57:28      | That would be awesome.                                                                                 |
| 57:29      | Yeah, I'm definitely going to keep doing it to try and make our lives easier.                          |
| 57:34      | So by all means, book me.                                                                              |
| 57:37      | Consider it done.                                                                                      |
| 57:38      | There is one other thing that might be more interesting to people.                                     |
| 57:42      | So one other shortcut that might be valuable is there's a lot of to-dos, there's a lot                 |
| 57:48      | of daily tasks, especially with a three-month-old, and depending on how neurotic you are, we're        |
| 57:54      | fairly high on the neuroticism scale, I think, about our little kiddo.                                 |
| 57:59      | There's a lot of little things that you need to set up.                                                |
| 58:01      | So I had a couple of shortcuts that run basically this timed routine.                                  |
| 58:05      | So it draws from a note, which has a certain syntax.                                                   |
| 58:09      | So I wrote out the day's tasks in like a number of minutes and then an M and a colon                   |
| 58:15      | and then the task.                                                                                     |
| 58:16      | And then the shortcut will take that.                                                                  |
| 58:18      | And depending on when we wake up, because it's relative, it'll program out all these                   |
| 58:22      | little reminders, 24 or so different reminders throughout the day that tend to need to be              |
| 58:29      | done at a certain time in order to make sure that everything's running smoothly.                       |
| 58:33      | That is really smart.                                                                                  |
| 58:34      | I've been doing some similar things as well with [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] that get set when I wake up,                |
| 58:40      | where it goes through and it looks at what's on my calendar for the day and sets an actual             |
| 58:45      | alarm on my phone 15 minutes before certain events and 13 minutes before other events.                 |
| 58:51      | But the concept of spacing out reminders from when I wake up hadn't yet occurred to me.                |
| 58:56      | So stealing that one, Ryan, stealing that for me.                                                      |
| 58:59      | I'm not a parent, but automations are for everyone.                                                    |
| 59:02      | I think I can share the shortcut.                                                                      |
| 59:03      | I'll format the note so that it's worth or able to be shared.                                          |
| 59:07      | Not all I can share that.                                                                              |
| 59:09      | And you guys are definitely both more neurotic than I am.                                              |
| 59:12      | Just I just want to say that because I never would occur to me to set one relative to the              |
| 59:17      | time I wake up.                                                                                        |
| 59:19      | But hey, well, sometimes you do need to do things, you know, like an hour or so after                  |
| 59:23      | you get up, you want to remember to do this or whatever.                                               |
| 59:26      | But I don't know when you're going to wake up.                                                         |
| 59:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 59:30      | Well, and it's the baby, right?                                                                        |
| 59:31      | The baby needs to be awake for three hours before you put her down for her nap for two                 |
| 59:34      | hours, which I think needs to lead to, yeah.                                                           |
| 59:37      | I get it.                                                                                              |
| 59:38      | I get it.                                                                                              |
| 59:39      | I will say that if you have two or three more kids at some point, you probably won't                   |
| 59:44      | be running that anymore.                                                                               |
| 59:46      | No.                                                                                                    |
| 59:47      | Admittedly, I've stopped using it.                                                                     |
| 59:48      | I used it for the first couple of weeks and then I got into the rhythm.                                |
| 59:51      | But yeah, it was especially important for the early days when you had to set up a humidifier           |
| 59:56      | and plug in certain devices and unplug other devices and it was all those checklists, right?           |
| 01:00:03   | It goes by so fast, man.                                                                               |
| 01:00:05   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:06   | Were you triggering that one, Brian, based on the shortcut automation trigger for wake                 |
| 01:00:11   | up with the sleep integration or were you just triggering that manually?                               |
| 01:00:16   | I was triggering it manually because it depended on when the baby woke up.                             |
| 01:00:19   | So.                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:20   | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:21   | Gotcha.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:22   | Although you could do motion detection, probably, make that work.                                      |
| 01:00:26   | Hopefully, but I would be slightly concerned that maybe that's the sort of thing where                 |
| 01:00:30   | we go wrong because to create the reminders, you would actually need to hand that off to               |
| 01:00:34   | a phone anyway.                                                                                        |
| 01:00:36   | So you're going to need something like push automation server for that, which is increasing            |
| 01:00:40   | the complexity of this and the barrier to entry somewhat.                                              |
| 01:00:44   | And then you could send those reminders either to the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] app or to the [[Due]] app, I would          |
| 01:00:47   | assume if you really had something that was like a hard reminder.                                      |
| 01:00:52   | I actually have a problem with automating, creating reminders in the [[Due]] app using the                  |
| 01:00:55   | [[Due]] actions because it opens [[Due]] every time.                                                             |
| 01:00:58   | So what I'm doing instead when I create [[Due]] reminders is I add them all to a [[Due]] list in                 |
| 01:01:02   | [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and then at the end of the shortcut, I open the [[Due]] app, which imports everything             |
| 01:01:07   | from that list.                                                                                        |
| 01:01:08   | I wonder that I don't see [[Due]] opening up when I run the laundry shortcut that I've got.                 |
| 01:01:12   | So maybe it's just a little config somewhere.                                                          |
| 01:01:15   | I don't find that much use for automating [[Due]] because I use it for just a few very specific             |
| 01:01:20   | things and I just don't need to create a lot of things in [[Due]].                                          |
| 01:01:24   | I mean, my life isn't such that I need to be nagged about everything, but it has got                   |
| 01:01:31   | a pretty powerful automation support.                                                                  |
| 01:01:34   | I mean, you can do a lot with shortcuts in [[Due]].                                                         |
| 01:01:37   | They've done a good job of implementing it.                                                            |
| 01:01:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:40   | And sorry, Rose, you're right.                                                                         |
| 01:01:41   | I'm doing the same thing.                                                                              |
| 01:01:42   | I'm adding a reminder to a special [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list that gets sucked up in [[Due]].                         |
| 01:01:47   | But yeah, David, you're right.                                                                         |
| 01:01:49   | [[Due]] has saved my life quite a bit the last year.                                                        |
| 01:01:51   | But it's almost like I feel like if you use it too much, then it loses its effectiveness.              |
| 01:01:58   | It's easier to ignore it if it starts going off five times a day.                                      |
| 01:02:02   | It's true.                                                                                             |
| 01:02:03   | Or how many do I have?                                                                                 |
| 01:02:04   | Let's just count.                                                                                      |
| 01:02:05   | I'm guessing 15.                                                                                       |
| 01:02:06   | Wow.                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:07   | Wow.                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:08   | That's a lot.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:10   | No, 10.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:11   | Closer to 10.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:13   | Maybe I'm using an old view action then that does that.                                                |
| 01:02:14   | No, no.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:15   | Sorry, Rose, you're right.                                                                             |
| 01:02:16   | I double checked my work.                                                                              |
| 01:02:17   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:18   | You're right.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:19   | Darn it.                                                                                               |
| 01:02:20   | Darn it.                                                                                               |
| 01:02:21   | I'm just checking just in case because sometimes other people have found this because, so there        |
| 01:02:25   | are three different [[Due]] actions inside of [[Shortcuts]].                                                    |
| 01:02:28   | There's one under text, which is add to your reminder.                                                 |
| 01:02:31   | And then there's do create repeating reminder and do create reminder.                                  |
| 01:02:35   | And the repeating reminder, I believe, is sort of like for daily or weekly things.                     |
| 01:02:40   | And let me just test to see.                                                                           |
| 01:02:42   | I'm just going to double check it again myself because I'm never sure if I'm doing this.               |
| 01:02:47   | Oh, there's a show where I'm run option.                                                               |
| 01:02:49   | Oh, maybe this adds it in the background.                                                              |
| 01:02:51   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:52   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:53   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:54   | So there are finally, I don't know when those got added.                                               |
| 01:02:55   | Obviously, I've missed those.                                                                          |
| 01:02:56   | Guess I might need to rework some Shortcuts.                                                           |
| 01:02:58   | On the other hand, I could just leave it because it works.                                             |
| 01:03:01   | So have to decide there what the correct solution is.                                                  |

| 01:04:17   | for this purpose.                                                                                      |

| 01:04:23   | There's no part of DEVONthink that can't be automated.                                                 |
| 01:04:26   | Extend DEVONthink's functionality with your own commands by adding them to its Scripts                 |
| 01:04:30   | menu.                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:32   | Even templates can have scripts inside and you can set up new documents and data from                  |
| 01:04:37   | placeholders or inserted by your own AppleScript code.                                                 |
| 01:04:41   | And of course, there's so much more from an iOS companion app to email archiving, scanning             |
| 01:04:46   | and even an embedded web server for sharing your data securely with your team.                         |
| 01:04:51   | DEVONthink gives me so many of the tools that I rely upon.                                             |

| 01:05:07   | So if you want to do contextual computing like I do and you want to have an OmniFocus                  |
| 01:05:12   | task that jumps to a DEVONthink document, it's simply a matter of copying a single link.               |
| 01:05:17   | Which by the way, can be automated.                                                                    |

| 01:05:32   | And our thanks to DEVONtechnologies for the support of the Automators and all of RelayFM.              |
| 01:05:39   | Ryan, when we were prepping for the show today, you talked about the idea of augmented intelligence    |
| 01:05:45   | as the automation for a tool for this.                                                                 |
| 01:05:48   | And I thought that was kind of a fascinating topic.                                                    |
| 01:05:50   | Can you explain that for the audience?                                                                 |
| 01:05:52   | Yeah, happily.                                                                                         |
| 01:05:54   | This comes from the word or the phrase augmented intelligence comes from, I think it was Doug          |
| 01:05:58   | Engelbart, one of the founding people of computing.                                                 |
| 01:06:03   | He sat at Xerox park.                                                                                |
| 01:06:04   | He came up with a lot of the ideas that Apple ended up adopting into its early operating               |
| 01:06:07   | systems and made the computer what it is today.                                                        |
| 01:06:11   | So Doug was really excited about this idea of augmented intelligence.                                  |
| 01:06:14   | How computers shouldn't just be these like rote convenience tools, but they should help                |
| 01:06:19   | us think bigger and think better.                                                                      |
| 01:06:21   | And that kind of work has evolved a little bit.                                                        |
| 01:06:24   | If you're into research and you want to look into augmented cognition, there's some work               |
| 01:06:27   | at a DARPA, the defense agency in the States, where they're interested in how people who               |
| 01:06:32   | are in combat situations are thinking and responding or changing how the tech that they're using       |
| 01:06:38   | works, depending on, you know, how stressed a fighter is or whatever, which is obviously               |
| 01:06:43   | a hard context to relate to.                                                                           |
| 01:06:45   | But I still think there's something there about having our tools respond to not only                   |
| 01:06:50   | our contexts, but also us and whatever we're going through or whatever we're dealing with.             |
| 01:06:57   | So for a quick story, I'm a PhD candidate.                                                             |
| 01:07:00   | I wrote my comprehensive exams a couple of years ago.                                                  |
| 01:07:02   | It's kind of like, you know, trying to pass the bar for a lawyer or writing a licensing                |
| 01:07:06   | exam for another professional.                                                                         |
| 01:07:07   | It's very intense.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:08   | I had to read something like 300 papers and a textbook or three in order to prep.                      |
| 01:07:15   | And you know, I'm an anxious person.                                                                   |
| 01:07:16   | I think the deeper solution here would have been for me to get a counselor 10 years ago,               |
| 01:07:19   | but since I didn't do that, I had to fight my anxiety with other ways, my anxiety about                |
| 01:07:24   | this exam.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:26   | And so I built out this little shortcut that is working with these ideas of augmented intelligence.    |
| 01:07:32   | And the idea is to, it's similar to the setups that people have talked about in the past               |
| 01:07:39   | couple of years.                                                                                       |
| 01:07:41   | But all it does is it asks what I'm going to work on, how long I'm going to work on                    |
| 01:07:44   | it.                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:46   | And then it does a little thing where it creates some check-ins.                                       |
| 01:07:50   | And these are simple reminders that show up at randomly interspersed intervals in the                  |
| 01:07:54   | next, during the period that I'm planning on working.                                                  |
| 01:07:58   | And with random sort of phrases that check in on my status.                                            |
| 01:08:04   | And the whole point is to simply give me a thing that I'm not waiting for, because if                  |
| 01:08:09   | it was evenly spaced, it wouldn't make any sense.                                                      |
| 01:08:11   | You could just ignore it.                                                                              |
| 01:08:12   | And that shows up when you're not expecting it.                                                        |
| 01:08:14   | And it says, how's it going?                                                                           |
| 01:08:16   | Are you procrastinating?                                                                               |
| 01:08:17   | If so, maybe you should try meditation, or if so, maybe you should consider changing                   |
| 01:08:22   | your modes, or thinking about whatever is on the top of your mind that's distracting                   |
| 01:08:25   | you or whatever.                                                                                       |
| 01:08:26   | And the fundamental idea here is to make the phone sort of this governor of my time and                |
| 01:08:33   | my anxiety and to try and fight the instincts that I have to avoid whatever is in front                |
| 01:08:37   | of me that's scary in order to keep me on task and get me through that comprehensive                   |
| 01:08:43   | exam.                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:44   | And I am a PhD candidate.                                                                              |
| 01:08:45   | That means I passed.                                                                                   |
| 01:08:46   | So I guess something about it worked, although there probably is a good argument that if               |
| 01:08:50   | I hadn't spent so much time fiddling with automations, I probably would have done even                 |
| 01:08:53   | better.                                                                                                |
| 01:08:54   | But that's where we are.                                                                               |
| 01:08:55   | Well, no, I think there's really something to this.                                                    |
| 01:08:58   | I mean, before there was an iPhone back in the early 90s, I was learning Zen meditation.               |
| 01:09:04   | And my teacher, one of the instructions she gave me was whenever the telephone rings,                  |
| 01:09:10   | you know, the instant the telephone rings, ask yourself, was whatever I was doing at                   |
| 01:09:16   | that moment that the telephone ring, was I mindful about what I was doing?                             |
| 01:09:20   | And, you know, I'm sorry, the hippie stuff.                                                            |
| 01:09:22   | Some people don't like it.                                                                             |
| 01:09:23   | But it's like the idea of like, if I'm writing a contract at the moment, the phone ring,               |
| 01:09:28   | was I actually writing a contract or was I thinking about my lunch?                                    |
| 01:09:33   | And that's something that as humans, it's hard for us to do it, but it's a muscle you                  |
| 01:09:36   | can build.                                                                                             |
| 01:09:37   | And in essence, the way I was doing it back then was I was creating my own random reminders            |
| 01:09:42   | by the telephone ring because you never know when the telephone is going to ring.                      |
| 01:09:46   | And that's a practice that I've never stopped.                                                         |
| 01:09:49   | I still do it to this day.                                                                             |
| 01:09:50   | And I also add to it text notifications at this point.                                                 |
| 01:09:54   | So if a text notification comes in, I just, it's rote for me.                                          |
| 01:09:57   | I ask myself, okay, like, Rose will text me, hey, can we do the show an hour earlier?                  |
| 01:10:02   | Okay, well, at the moment my phone rang, you know, whatever I was doing, was I actually                |
| 01:10:07   | doing that?                                                                                            |
| 01:10:08   | Or was I was my brain somewhere else?                                                                  |
| 01:10:11   | And I think it's something that everybody should try to work on because if you can be                  |
| 01:10:18   | present with your work, you can get better work done and you can enjoy your life.                      |
| 01:10:22   | And honestly, that's what you're there to do anyway, right?                                            |
| 01:10:24   | So just do it.                                                                                         |
| 01:10:25   | Or, or it's not even just work, like if I'm playing Lego with my kid and the phone rings,              |
| 01:10:32   | was I playing Lego with my kid or was I thinking about that contract?                                  |
| 01:10:35   | You know, it's like you just ask yourself that question.                                               |
| 01:10:38   | So what you've done is created an automation system that kind of duplicates the, the telephone         |
| 01:10:44   | effect that I have.                                                                                    |
| 01:10:45   | Is that fair?                                                                                          |
| 01:10:46   | I mean, I don't know, maybe you're doing more than that, but it sounds to me like it's                 |
| 01:10:49   | kind of the same idea.                                                                                 |
| 01:10:50   | Yeah, it's absolutely the same idea.                                                                   |
| 01:10:52   | It's just this simple thing.                                                                           |
| 01:10:53   | And I was using the app, just timer at the time, or guest timer, which creates this little             |
| 01:10:58   | timer up in the upper right.                                                                           |
| 01:11:01   | And so that's where I would see the notification come in is, is from guest timer, just timer.          |
| 01:11:05   | So I kind of knew that it was coming, but it gave me this sort of rhythm.                              |
| 01:11:10   | It gave me this, or even overseer, right?                                                              |
| 01:11:13   | That's the other perspective on this is like, if I'm not, if I'm not having personal integrity         |
| 01:11:17   | in this current moment and sticking to what I said I was going to do, my self of the past              |
| 01:11:22   | is going to judge me.                                                                                  |
| 01:11:23   | Well, I would, I would interrupt there and say, don't judge yourself.                                  |
| 01:11:27   | You're a human.                                                                                        |
| 01:11:28   | We all do it.                                                                                          |
| 01:11:29   | But just be aware, just be aware that sometimes you get lost and did you find that you got             |
| 01:11:35   | better at it?                                                                                          |
| 01:11:36   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:37   | I mean, I don't use it anymore.                                                                        |
| 01:11:39   | Maybe because I don't have anything as beastly as PhD comps in front of me.                            |
| 01:11:44   | But I had to stitch it back together to prepare for this work, this, this conversation with            |
| 01:11:49   | you guys.                                                                                              |
| 01:11:50   | And it made me want to use it again.                                                                   |
| 01:11:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:54   | I'm, I'm, I'm really curious.                                                                          |
| 01:11:55   | How were you calculating random times?                                                                 |
| 01:11:58   | Did you have like a specific number of reminders that you'd like to fit in to say a 60 minute          |
| 01:12:02   | window and then you, if you were working for 30 minutes, it would divide it by two and                 |
| 01:12:06   | just sort of measure things out or what, what was it doing for that?                                   |
| 01:12:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:11   | Basically you got it with that last idea.                                                              |
| 01:12:12   | It was, it was taking the amount of time that I was expecting to work.                                 |
| 01:12:15   | And then choosing a random number, I think it was dividing that between by 12 and then                 |
| 01:12:21   | choosing a random number related to that number.                                                       |
| 01:12:23   | So it was like, there's quite a few steps to try and make sure that it was really deliberately         |
| 01:12:26   | random and not too frequent and not too infrequent either.                                             |
| 01:12:32   | But yeah, it was a neat idea.                                                                          |
| 01:12:34   | And actually I forgot one other part of that, but I think it may be the most interesting               |
| 01:12:37   | part.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:38   | And it was a step in the process of that setup that did what, I guess David Allen has talked           |
| 01:12:46   | about this as a kind of visualisation.                                                                 |
| 01:12:48   | But the idea is to, was to actually prompt me to think about like why am I doing this                  |
| 01:12:54   | and to think of a moment in the future when I'm past this, when it's gone well and it's                |
| 01:12:58   | okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:59   | And again, this is me, you know, managing some anxiety that I was fighting, but it's                   |
| 01:13:04   | a really neat little trick where I again use that same idea that I talked about earlier                |
| 01:13:07   | and talking about home, the [[Obsidian]] home screen and the projects list.                                |
| 01:13:11   | I just have a plain text file and a list of descriptive moments like sitting on the couch              |
| 01:13:15   | watching TV without anything on my mind except for hanging out and not worrying about this             |
| 01:13:18   | comprehensive exam.                                                                                    |
| 01:13:20   | And so the shortcut would actually grab one of those from that list randomly and show                  |
| 01:13:24   | it to me and say, you know, like, think about this, anchor yourself there and don't try                |
| 01:13:29   | to let go of some of the imposter syndRoam or anxiety that you're fighting in this moment.             |
| 01:13:33   | And again, that goes back to this idea of augmented intelligence.                                      |
| 01:13:35   | It's like, how can we ask our computers to remind us of who we really are trying to be?                |
| 01:13:40   | And I think there's an untapped potential there for a lot of people to try and make themselves         |
| 01:13:45   | think more clearly and bigger and cleaner.                                                             |
| 01:13:48   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:49   | And I really like that.                                                                                |
| 01:13:51   | That is a really good automation idea.                                                                 |
| 01:13:53   | There's one thing I would probably do, I'm going to steal this and give this a try for                 |
| 01:13:57   | certain things.                                                                                        |
| 01:13:59   | There's an app that came out recently on iOS called affirmations, which just sends you                 |
| 01:14:02   | random nice messages throughout the day.                                                               |
| 01:14:05   | I would probably replace a couple of the remind, like, you know, don't forget to do this with          |
| 01:14:10   | some scheduled ones of those because it can pop up automatically randomly, but also adding             |
| 01:14:16   | a couple of extras to the notification you get, or maybe even just appending it to the                 |
| 01:14:20   | title would be really cool because there's a gap formation action in shortcuts, of course.             |
| 01:14:26   | So yeah, I really love that idea, though.                                                              |
| 01:14:29   | There are some days where I do struggle to stay on task, so I can imagine grabbing that                |
| 01:14:33   | shortcut for those days.                                                                               |
| 01:14:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:35   | A couple points there.                                                                                 |
| 01:14:36   | First, just on the nerd side, I'm a big fan of Readwise, which collects all of my highlights           |
| 01:14:41   | from all of my Kindle and other things I read.                                                         |
| 01:14:44   | I don't know if they have an API.                                                                      |
| 01:14:45   | I'm going to look into it because that would be cool, Rose, rather than using affirmations             |
| 01:14:48   | to actually use your own chosen highlights out of Readwise.                                            |
| 01:14:52   | I mean, you could also just store them in [[Data Jar]] or something.                                       |
| 01:14:55   | I know Readwise has integrations with some things because I believe, is there a Readwise               |
| 01:15:00   | plugin for [[Obsidian]], I want to say?                                                                    |
| 01:15:02   | Well, they have a Readwise plugin that will send your annotations over to [[Obsidian]].                    |
| 01:15:09   | But what I'm thinking is I want to grab a random, maybe, favourite because you can favourite             |
| 01:15:14   | them in Readwise.                                                                                      |
| 01:15:15   | I'm going to grab a random favourite Readwise highlight and then give it to shortcuts to                |
| 01:15:20   | do something with.                                                                                     |
| 01:15:22   | They have an advanced API section which starts with highlights list, which gets a list of              |
| 01:15:27   | your highlights.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:28   | There you go.                                                                                          |
| 01:15:29   | I just got to figure it out now.                                                                       |
| 01:15:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:31   | It's a get request.                                                                                    |
| 01:15:33   | You can even filter by tags and everything.                                                            |
| 01:15:35   | I'll put a link to the Readwise API in the show notes for people.                                      |
| 01:15:38   | Now, the show's cost me two weekends, so that's cool.                                                  |
| 01:15:42   | You're welcome, David.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:43   | But the other thing is though, at the bigger issue you're getting at with this augmented               |
| 01:15:47   | intelligence and the steps you're taking, I think is something that everybody listening                |
| 01:15:51   | should consider.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:54   | Technology is wonderful and it has done a great job of connecting us and making our lives easier,      |
| 01:16:00   | but there is an inherent risk with technology.                                                         |
| 01:16:02   | In my opinion, it's that lack of focus and I know I'm preaching about another podcast                  |
| 01:16:07   | now, but there is a problem of focus with technology and just watch anybody.                           |
| 01:16:15   | Last night I was driving home, my wife was driving home and I was in the passenger seat                |
| 01:16:19   | and the car in front of us didn't have active taillights.                                              |
| 01:16:22   | The taillights weren't working for whatever reason and the guy was swerving and my wife                |
| 01:16:28   | and I are like, he's on his phone and finally we hit a red light and so we pull up next                |
| 01:16:33   | to him and I roll down the window and I'm, because I wanted to tell him his taillights                 |
| 01:16:39   | weren't working and I'm like, wavy, I'm sticking my hands out the window like a crazy man,             |
| 01:16:44   | but I mean, we were stopped.                                                                           |
| 01:16:45   | I mean, it was at a red light, but I'm yelling at the top of my lungs and he's looking, I'm            |
| 01:16:51   | to, he's on my right, I'm on his left, you know, two cars parked next to each other.                   |
| 01:16:55   | I'm in the passenger seat, so I'm literally like two or three feet away from him and he's              |
| 01:16:59   | literally looking to his left and down and you can see his face lit up by his phone and                |
| 01:17:05   | I'm thinking this crazy man is driving down the road looking at his phone.                             |
| 01:17:09   | He stops at a red light and there's a person yelling at him three feet away and he doesn't             |
| 01:17:13   | even notice.                                                                                           |
| 01:17:14   | You know, well, anyway, that's a long story to say this technology can cause us to lose                |
| 01:17:19   | focus sometimes and I think as, as automators, we can take focus back with things like what            |
| 01:17:26   | Ryan is doing and I am a huge fan of this and I think everybody should, should look                    |
| 01:17:31   | whether it is putting do reminders in, whether it's listening for the telephone to ring or             |
| 01:17:36   | or setting up Ryan's script.                                                                           |
| 01:17:37   | I think everybody would benefit from trying to find a way to find a little more focus                  |
| 01:17:43   | in their life despite their technology, maybe using your technology to help you get that               |
| 01:17:49   | back.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:51   | I preached again.                                                                                      |
| 01:17:52   | I'm sorry.                                                                                             |
| 01:17:53   | I preached too much.                                                                                   |
| 01:17:54   | No, no, I wanted to say amen.                                                                          |
| 01:17:56   | But again, I'm not sorry about this, but I definitely agree fundamentally with everything              |
| 01:17:59   | you're saying and just to offer one, maybe less hippie element of it or angle on it.                   |
| 01:18:06   | Another way I can see this working is through sort of self-facilitation.                               |
| 01:18:09   | So good facilitator, you know, leads group of people through an exercise and if you're                 |
| 01:18:13   | working alone, you can't really do that.                                                               |
| 01:18:15   | But I imagine you could set up, say you're going to do a little sprint on a project you're             |
| 01:18:20   | working on and maybe you typically would go through a phase of planning out the project                |
| 01:18:24   | and then starting the work and you could use this kind of approach to give yourself a mode             |
| 01:18:30   | or a method of moderating that, right?                                                                 |
| 01:18:33   | So you sit down and you say, okay, in 15 minutes, I want my phone to tell me that I'm done sketching   |
| 01:18:37   | out this idea and I need to open up the typewriter and write fade in and keep going, right?            |
| 01:18:43   | And get this, the great American novel out of me in the next 45 minutes.                               |
| 01:18:46   | And it's similar to the concepts that we've seen for a long time about Pomodoro and so                 |
| 01:18:50   | on.                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:51   | But I think the neat thing is that you can use automation, you can use tools like shortcuts            |
| 01:18:55   | to very simply make this a little bit more personalised and intelligent.                               |
| 01:19:00   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:19:01   | And I think that is the beauty of automation tied into everything else here, isn't it?                 |
| 01:19:06   | It is the personal element that it is tailored to you and your needs, which makes it much              |
| 01:19:11   | better.                                                                                                |
| 01:19:12   | And I'd also argue that, you know, that solves the other problem of the kind of the maker              |
| 01:19:16   | manager problem.                                                                                       |
| 01:19:17   | We all have to be a manager, but we also have to be a maker and using automation to mode               |
| 01:19:23   | shift that to make it to, you know, just, you know, like the, like the whistle in the                  |
| 01:19:29   | factory, you know, you can use automation to get yourself out of one mode into the next.               |
| 01:19:36   | Absolutely.                                                                                            |
| 01:19:37   | Well, that was, that was definitely hippie.                                                            |
| 01:19:39   | But I think I hope I got through, if I got through to one person, that's worth it because              |
| 01:19:43   | this stuff is so, so useful and I do think like it doesn't require JavaScript programming              |
| 01:19:51   | to take advantage of automation this way and really, you know, make an improvement on the              |
| 01:19:55   | way you get through your day and enjoy your life.                                                      |
| 01:19:59   | I mean, I was thinking when you were telling me about this augmented intelligence and the              |
| 01:20:03   | reminders you're getting, I think that a perfect application for that is daughter time.                |
| 01:20:09   | You need to be completely present with her because I can tell you before you know it,                  |
| 01:20:14   | you will be looking at her college feed and it'll feel like it was yesterday that she                  |
| 01:20:19   | was a baby.                                                                                            |
| 01:20:21   | So you want to be there when she's there.                                                              |
| 01:20:25   | You don't want to be thinking about, you know, scripting [[Obsidian]] or working on your                   |
| 01:20:29   | PhD.                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:30   | You just want to be there for her and, and finding a way maybe to use your tech to help                |
| 01:20:34   | you be more present is, is a very good use of your tech.                                               |
| 01:20:37   | Absolutely.                                                                                            |
| 01:20:38   | Well, Ryan, I feel like we just scratched the surface today.                                           |
| 01:20:43   | We have so much here.                                                                                  |
| 01:20:45   | There's a bunch in this outline that we never got to.                                                  |
| 01:20:47   | So we're going to hold on to this.                                                                     |
| 01:20:48   | We're going to get you back at some point, but I want to thank you so much for coming                  |
| 01:20:51   | on.                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:52   | For toddler automation.                                                                                |
| 01:20:53   | Toddler automation.                                                                                    |
| 01:20:54   | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:55   | That is going to be the big hit of the next few years.                                                 |
| 01:20:58   | And we all are looking forward to hearing how you progress.                                            |
| 01:21:01   | I mean, so I understand you're right now on leave with your, with your new baby, but at                |
| 01:21:06   | some point you're going to be going on past being a PhD candidate.                                     |
| 01:21:11   | What's next for you?                                                                                   |
| 01:21:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:21:13   | That's a good question.                                                                                |
| 01:21:14   | I mean, I'm interested in research for an impactful research, right, and doing things                  |
| 01:21:18   | that are as helpful to people.                                                                         |
| 01:21:20   | And one of my research interests, that's why I'm writing about this stuff all the time,                |
| 01:21:24   | is this kind of topic, right?                                                                          |
| 01:21:26   | Automation, progress, intelligence, or data modeling, in terms of notes, right?                        |
| 01:21:32   | And so, yeah, I'm even to graduate from my PhD and find a nice faculty role somewhere,                 |
| 01:21:38   | which can be challenging, but that's the goal.                                                         |
| 01:21:39   | And hopefully keep kind of publishing on this stuff and adding some rigour to it.                       |
| 01:21:44   | That's the, that's the dream.                                                                          |
| 01:21:45   | Well, I'm going to cross my fingers.                                                                   |
| 01:21:46   | That works out for you.                                                                                |
| 01:21:47   | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 01:21:48   | I'm certain it will.                                                                                   |
| 01:21:49   | I'm certain it will.                                                                                   |
| 01:21:50   | I have faith.                                                                                          |
| 01:21:51   | Oh yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:21:52   | Same.                                                                                                  |
| 01:21:53   | Another angle, the augmented intelligence stuff to me is the way [[Obsidian]] connects                     |
| 01:21:57   | things for me before my brain does.                                                                    |
| 01:21:59   | And I think that might be another nice topic for us the next time you come on.                         |
| 01:22:03   | So we're going to put a pin in that as well.                                                           |
| 01:22:07   | Where can people find you, right?                                                                      |
| 01:22:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:22:10   | So most of the stuff I write on these topics, it can be found on axle.design, axle.design.              |
| 01:22:17   | And I'm trying to focus my writing there on the topics we covered here.                                |
| 01:22:20   | I do have another website, fulcra.design, as in the plural of fulcrum, fulcra.                         |
| 01:22:27   | And that's where I write about some other topics that might not be that exciting to                    |
| 01:22:30   | people here, but on systems thinking and solving, solving complex problems in the world.               |
| 01:22:35   | It's the other research that I'm engaged in.                                                           |
| 01:22:38   | We have both links to those in the show notes.                                                         |
| 01:22:41   | Great.                                                                                                 |
| 01:22:42   | And we all appreciate your contribution to not just [[Obsidian]], but you know, everything                 |
| 01:22:46   | you've been doing over in the forums and all the great posts you've got over at axle.design.            |
| 01:22:50   | Again, go check it out.                                                                                |
| 01:22:52   | This is one you're going to want to add to your RSS feed.                                              |
| 01:22:54   | If you're interested in automation, Ryan has got the stuff here for you.                               |
| 01:22:59   | So we appreciate everything you've done and coming on today.                                           |
| 01:23:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:23:05   | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 01:23:06   | It's been a really fun conversation.                                                                   |
| 01:23:07   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:23:08   | That wraps it up for this week's episode of the Automators Podcast.                                    |

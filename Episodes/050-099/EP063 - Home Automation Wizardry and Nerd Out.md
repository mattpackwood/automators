| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and as always, I'm joined                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:06      | by my fellow co-host, David Sparks, and we are going to talk about making your house                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:10      | do all of the work for you today. Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 00:13      | Ros, I am very excited about today's episode. We have been teasing your home automation                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:19      | now for several episodes. You got your own place. You keep sending me pictures of all                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:26      | of this home automation stuff you've been buying today is the day we find out exactly                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:30      | what you're up to. Well, I mean, it's not just the day that                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:33      | we find out what I've been up to, because you've got a couple of little updates that                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:36      | you mentioned you've been working on, and if we've got time, we'll work those in. But                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 00:39      | we also have new gadgets, because, you know, it's new iPhone season, so we got new iPhones,                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:46      | and I believe we are iPhone twins. Yeah, I thought as Automators it'd be fun                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:49      | just to check in on that real quick. We both bought the Big Boy, the iPhone 12 Pro Max.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:57      | What do you think of yours? It's Pacific Blue, and it's, yeah, it's                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:02      | awesome. I love it. It's great. I love the different colour. I love how fast the NFC                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07      | reactions are. That's working really well for me, which is great for all sorts of automation                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11      | things. And I'm loving having that big phone again. It lets me see more shortcut sections                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:17      | on the screen at once, which sounds like a very bad reason to buy a bigger phone. But                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:21      | let's be honest, I'm not going anywhere anyway, and I don't have pockets that any iPhone will                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:26      | fit into even the mini, so I figured go big and be happy with it. How about you?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:32      | It fits in my pocket, but it really couldn't get any bigger. I mean, it's just, I think                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:37      | I'm at max phone size now. If they said it was bigger, I probably wouldn't be able to                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:41      | do it. But you're right. The Shortcuts app is beautiful on that big screen. It's great                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:47      | to build automations with a little bit more available screen real estate. It doesn't feel                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 04:53      | Yeah, yeah. Yeah, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:55      | It is very, uh, this whole [[MagSafe]] world is cool. We talked about this on Mac Power Users,                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:00      | but I, I kind of hate the name because I love [[MagSafe]] so much on my Mac. It just breaks                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:06      | my heart every time we say [[MagSafe]] and it's not on my Mac. But the, um, but I do think                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:11      | that because it's an open standard, in essence, anybody can make a set of magnets into their,                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:16      | their hardware without having to get Apple's permission. I think we may see some really                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:21      | cool implementations over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:24      | Yes, definitely. I'm really looking forward to it. And we're already seeing a lot of people                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:28      | like 3D printing stands for the [[MagSafe]] charger and stuff. And I am looking forward to seeing                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:32      | what automations people come up with because I found with the flat key chargers that, uh,                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:37      | my phone could vibrate off of them, which they meant that, uh, you know, sometimes it                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:41      | would be flat in the morning. And more importantly, it would run my disconnected from, uh, power                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:45      | automation at the wrong time. Um, so, uh, I switched to standing key chargers in most                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:51      | places. I have one in my office, two in my bedroom, one on each side of the bed, just                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:54      | so I can put my phone whichever side, uh, one in my living room. But, uh, I, I'm still                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 05:59      | going to be trialling [[MagSafe]] for travel whenever that becomes a thing again. Um, and my car                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 06:05      | because, you know, it seems like a great idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:08      | Well, well, [[MagSafe]], I think does have automation implementation. And I just think we're not                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:13      | totally sure what all that is yet, but yeah, just be advised, dear listener that Rose and                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:19      | I are both thinking and looking into this. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. We are. Cause we love nerding                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 06:25      | out on all of this wizardry. And speaking of which, um, what there's currently a beta                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:31      | out for iOS 14.3 that adds a bunch of features to shortcuts. And we're going to cover those                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 06:36      | at the end of today's show. Um, but there's just a lot of good stuff coming for mobile                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 06:41      | automation right now. Yes, definitely. And, you know, it's always great to see, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:46      | what updates are in the pipeline and, uh, also what surprises Apple love to spring on                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:50      | us. So I'm looking forward to seeing some of those too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:53      | All right. Um, but let's switch over to, you know, your home automation. Uh, you, uh, bought                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:00      | your own place recently and you have been busy getting, you know, painting and carpeting                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:06      | and whatnot, but, but you also had kind of a fresh canvas for home automation. And I                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:14      | think before we get into the nitty gritty of, of what you've installed and are using,                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:19      | I mean, how does someone like Rose, uh, figure out a plan to begin with?                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:25      | Well, um, so this whole planning thing, I've heard great things about it. Uh, planning                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:32      | is wonderful. Everybody should plan things. I did not plan this at all. Uh, so that,                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:38      | that's not entirely true. I knew I had a starting point. So I had some things that I had used                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 07:42      | in Austria. So I had some hue light bulbs and lamps. Uh, so, you know, I had a go and                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:47      | I risked a light strip and then a whole bunch of bulbs, mostly white ones, uh, but one colour                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:51      | one as well. I had a Logitech Harmony. Um, and I also knew that my heaters here in my                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:57      | new place, uh, I don't have gas. Uh, I just have electric, but I have very efficient,                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:02      | uh, ceramic heaters, which store heat for a really long time, which is great. And I                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:06      | love it. And they plug into the wall. And so I knew that I was getting smart outlets                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 08:10      | for those because two of them have got thermostats and two of them do not. They, they, you just                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 08:14      | talk to them on and off and there's a dial. Um, and so I decided that for the two that                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:19      | don't have thermostats, I was going to do a smart home thermostat thing. And for all                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 08:22      | of them, I wanted to be able to turn them off when I left the house, if nobody was here                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 08:26      | so that I wouldn't be paying to heat the place if I'm not here because that would be very                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:29      | energy and efficient. And, you know, I like our world. Let's keep it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:33      | And then the other thing you had is the British voltage, which is higher than us voltage.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:38      | And as a result, you were mentioning on the show that, that, that puts some limitations                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 08:43      | on your ability to like open up switches and plugs in the wall and start making like replacing                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:48      | plugs themselves. Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:49      | Yeah. Yeah. So specifically kitchens and bathrooms here in the UK, uh, you need to be a qualified                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 08:54      | electrician if you're going to go and mess with the electrics. Um, I mean, technically                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:58      | anybody can open it up and do something, but then, you know, if you'd set your house on                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:02      | fire or electrocute yourself, the insurance company will not pay out if it was not a qualified                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:06      | electrician doing the job. Um, so as always, you need to be careful. Um, and I did have                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:11      | a qualified electrician come in and do some things, uh, but it was a case of replacing                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 09:15      | the ancient fluorescent tube in the kitchen with a, you know, nice LED tube and the actual                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:21      | light switch itself was not touched as a part of this. And I did ask about, you know, replacing                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 09:27      | it with a smart one because, uh, I looked into light wave, uh, but, um, the look the                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:33      | electrician gave me was there's a global pandemic. I have 8001 jobs and you want me to replace                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:38      | your light switch. Uh, that's going to cost you a lot of money. And I thought, you know                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:43      | what, I can live with this. And, uh, so I explored other options there. Um, but you know, it,                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:48      | it worked out pretty well because everywhere else, you know, if, if you know what you're                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 09:52      | doing, um, and when I say, if you know what you're doing, I mean, not just you've lit                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 09:55      | it up on YouTube, but you actually genuinely know what you're doing. You could do things                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:00      | and my electrics were actually in great shape. So I, I just, uh, you know, replace light                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:05      | bulbs and things like that, which was great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10:07      | Yeah. My grandfather was an electrician. So I kind of grew up learning from him enough                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 12:07      | Yeah. So I, and I have, as we talked about on MPU, gone with the Lutron Casetaa route,                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12:13      | and I used kind of a different math to get myself there. You know, it's funny how we                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12:16      | all do this stuff, right? But the, I was looking, there were four areas in my house where there                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:22      | was a single switch controlling four ceiling lights. And so to buy 12 hue lights that would                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12:31      | fit into all those sockets, it was going to be like, you know, $500, you know, they're,                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12:35      | they're expensive to get those flood light, those hue flood lights. And I was still having                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:40      | the problem of my family just turning the switch off and killing the automation, you                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12:46      | know, so where Lutron Casetaa was actually cheaper because I didn't have to replace the                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:50      | bulbs. All I had to do is replace the switch and you did have to buy that base unit though.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 12:55      | So I mean, there's really no like single answer for this stuff, but I think that's what you've                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:00      | got to go through in your head is, you know, what exactly are you trying to pull off and                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 13:04      | then kind of figure out, you know, how it's going to work best for you with me having                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 16:28      | I have gone with the very simple system of motion sensors. And I've also got some door                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:37      | sensors as well. So for example, my hallway has the official front door, and it does not                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 16:45      | in the middle. So whenever the front door is open, it turns on the overhead light.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16:49      | And that is done through an Aqara door sensor. Aqara is A-Q-A-R-A. I believe they're a                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 17:02      | relatively recently launched their own system, which in many cases is very affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17:07      | It's compatible with Xiaomi products. So if those are cheaper, as we'll get to with my                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 17:12      | motion sensor, then you can just pair those as well. And it works great. And the actual                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:20      | sensors are pretty tiny, which is great. So I've got a whole bunch of door and window                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17:23      | sensors that we'll get to. So when that door opens or in most rooms, if it detects motion                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 17:28      | and it's dark, because if it's just detecting motion, well, you could limit it to, say,                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:33      | between sunset and sunrise to turn on the lights. But especially if you use the Phillips Hue                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 17:39      | motion sensor, which I already had one off because I had Phillips Hue things in Austria.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:45      | And I just bought a couple more because I know that they have temperature sensors built in,                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 17:49      | which is nice to know how warm a room is. But they also have lux sensors. And lux tells you the                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 17:54      | light level of the room. And so ideally, you don't want to put this bright next to a light,                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:00      | especially if it is a dumb light that somebody will turn on and off automatically manually.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:04      | But, you know, I've got this on my desk. It's kind of pointing, like, diagonally towards the door-ish.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:10      | So I will be there when I come in. And it will all cross the path. And it just pings on the lights                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 18:16      | for me if it's dark. Now, playing with the lux levels, you're going to have to mess around.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:20      | But this also means on gray overcast days, of which sadly, there have been many recently,                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18:25      | my lights just turn on. And this happens in the bedroom. This happens in the living room and                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:30      | in my office. And in the hallway, it just sees motion and turns on the light because I decided                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 18:36      | not to invest in another hue sensor there. So I'm using a Xiaomi sensor paired to my Aqara hub.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:42      | All right. There's a lot to unpack there, Rose. Let's start with the switches. Now, are the                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:48      | switches home kit switches or are they just non-home kit switches on your doors?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:54      | Oh, no. So all the Aqara things integrate into home kit through the hub. So Aqara needs a hub,                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19:00      | just like Philips Hue has the bridge, and that pairs into home kit. And then once that's in home                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19:06      | kit, it reveals all of the different things attached to it. At least I believe it reveals                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:12      | all the things. I've certainly not had a problem with any of the items I've paired with it so far.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 19:18      | Yeah. And these home kit switches are a great investment. I have them as well. There are three                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 19:22      | doors in my house. Each one has a switch on it. There's a bunch of things you can do with it,                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 19:26      | like Rose has done. And they just stick on the door. So this is something you could definitely do                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19:31      | in an apartment. And it's got two pieces, one piece that goes on the door and one piece that goes                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19:37      | on the jam. And when they're separated, it triggers a switch. And I think it's a magnet inside there.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:44      | I'm not sure exactly what the technology is. It is. I'll get into that later, but I've been playing                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:49      | with exactly how these work. Okay. But as a home kit user, that gives you some data. You know,                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 19:56      | every time the door opens, you may want something to happen. Like for me on our front door, if it's                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:02      | dark out and that switch front door triggers switches, it turns on both the front porch light                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 20:11      | and also the light right inside the door. So you get light on both sides of the door anytime                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 20:18      | at night that the door is opened. And then they turn off automatically after five minutes, you know,                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20:24      | because you can do all this with home kit. And that's a very easy automation that anybody can do                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:29      | right in the home kit app. You don't need to add any extra tools. You know, you just set what it does                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:34      | and then you set a trigger. The other one I've been doing is the back door of my house. Sometimes                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:40      | the kids don't close it all the way because of the way the door works. You have to like kind of be                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 20:46      | firm to make sure it closes. And so I have a trigger that if it's if that switch is left open for                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:53      | I think it's five minutes, I get a text notification. And it's the same thing. And so I think this idea                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:00      | of switches on your doors, it's number one, not very expensive. You can do it anywhere, including                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21:05      | an apartment. And it's a great trigger for other automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21:10      | Yes, yeah, it definitely is. So I also have these on my windows. Now this is not for as a security thing.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21:17      | I actually am not really worried about security here. I do have a couple of cameras, but we'll get to those                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:22      | later in the show. But I have them on my windows. And this is purely so that when I go to bed, I can run                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:29      | a shortcut. It'll tell me which windows are open, which means that if I want to go around and close                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:33      | windows before I go to bed, I can because I know which ones are open so I don't have to go and manually                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:38      | check each one. But also, when I open the window, it turns off the heater in that room. And similarly, in my                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21:44      | living room, I've got some nice garden doors. When that door is opened, it turns off the heater in that room                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21:50      | so that I'm not heating a room and also letting the heat straight outside. And the heaters are just plugged into                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:56      | smart outlets. And we can dive into the IKEA side of things in a little bit, but I just bought the smart outlets                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:02      | from IKEA because they were very, very cheap and they work pretty well. But I've got that set up, which is great.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22:09      | And also, it means that when I close a window or close a door, then I can have the heater come back on. But what                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:15      | I did as well is if I turn the heater on, I run an automation. And this is when I convert it to a shortcut.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:23      | And what it does inside the shortcut, it checks if the window is open. And if the window is open, then it does                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:29      | get contents of URL. And it sends me a push cut notification to say, Hey, your windows open, I'm not turning your                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22:37      | heater on. And otherwise, it turns the heater on. Now, I could just say, you know, like, turn it off. You know, that                                                                                                                                                     |
| 22:44      | that's doable. And if you use something like the Home Plus app or the Eve app, then you can add extra                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:50      | conditions into shortcuts so that it will do different things, you know, based on the time of day or other things                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22:57      | on top of whatever it is that's triggering your automation. But in this particular case, I wanted it to kind of tap                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23:05      | me on the shoulder and say, Hey, you know, if you're cold, close the window rather than turning on the heater. And so                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23:11      | I set that up, which works really nicely, I have to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:14      | Yeah, I was just thinking, because for Southern California, the problem is in the heat, it's usually cool. And you                                                                                                                                                       |

| 23:25      | sensors on my windows. But I'm just thinking in the back of my head, what, because I do have a thermostat that's connected                                                                                                                                               |
| 23:32      | to [[HomeKit]]. I wonder if there's a way for me to set that up to run a test to say, Well, you've got windows open in the                                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:39      | bedroom and in the kitchen, you know, and then you could give yourself a notification to go close them before the                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:45      | air starts. I'm gonna have to look into that. I don't really have the answer to it yet. The concern I'd have is you                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23:52      | can't really do multiple ifs. I guess you could do it through a shortcut. That's, I'm just kind of figuring it out in my head as I                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:58      | sit here and talk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:59      | Yeah, if you want multiple ifs for something, then the home app itself is quite limited. So there are some things that it can                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:06      | do in an automation. So say, for example, when I arrive at home, and it's, you know, between sunset and some                                                                                                                                                             |
| 24:13      | sunrise, then, then it will turn on the lights in my living room so that I can see. But it can't do when I arrive home                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:25      | and the vacuum cleaner is on, then do this. It's not very good at checking things like that. But if you use, I personally like                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:34      | the Home Plus app by, I believe his name is Matthias Hochgatterer from Germany. And he's got a couple of great apps and the Home                                                                                                                                          |
| 24:43      | Plus app is a very solid one. It's currently a one time purchase. I believe he's building a new version. But it's a great app.                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:50      | The alternative is the Eve Energy app. And this is by Elgato, who make things like the wonderful Stream Deck. And they also make smart                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:58      | plugs and things like that. But you don't have to be using their smart home things to use their app. Though I am using two of their plugs for                                                                                                                            |
| 25:06      | different things than my teachers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 25:08      | Yeah, you can go a step further. And I feel like [[HomeKit]], as baked in, actually has gone further down the road than I kind of expected                                                                                                                                   |
| 25:16      | from Apple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:17      | Yes. Yeah, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 25:19      | But you're right. Once you start getting this saying, well, if he turns the air conditioning on, and if, you know, any of these windows                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:25      | are open, then send a notification that says this, that or the other, then you're beyond the scope of what [[HomeKit]] can do.                                                                                                                                               |
| 25:33      | Yeah, it can be a little tricky. But, you know, there are a lot of things that are possible, especially with the convert to shortcut action.                                                                                                                             |
| 25:40      | Though I know some people have had a few issues with reliability on that. Personally, I have found all of my notifications during the beta are triggering                                                                                                                |
| 25:49      | exactly when they're supposed to, which is great. But I could understand that potentially other people are having problems.                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:55      | Yeah, and I want to give a plus one to the Home+ app, because it's a great app. And that's the one I used to.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:01      | Yeah, it's a great one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:02      | All right. So we talked about the switches, then you talked about the motion sensors. And, you know, you've got different types of motion sensors.                                                                                                                       |
| 26:09      | This is the motion sensors are where a house with multiple people becomes a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:14      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:15      | Because some people don't want lights to turn on when they walk in a room, and they get mad because they don't really understand what's going on.                                                                                                                        |
| 26:23      | So I have limited use for motion sensors because of that. But I can totally see how if I lived alone, I would be going all in.                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:32      | Like I would have one in the bathroom. So at night you wake up, you walk in the bathroom, the lights turn on.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:37      | Yeah, yeah, that that sort of thing is great. And I'm currently toying with the idea of getting a very small motion sensor to put under my bed,                                                                                                                          |
| 26:46      | because I have the light strip from Philips from the Hue range. And it's currently in my office, and it's very pretty and very nice.                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:54      | And it looks great. But I don't really need it in here lighting wise. So I'm kind of thinking that I'm just going to fix this under my bed.                                                                                                                              |
| 27:02      | I'd sort of like the foot of my bed, and then have a very small motion sensor that if it senses motion during the night, it'll just turn that on.                                                                                                                        |
| 27:09      | And I won't use the regular motion sensor because I can trigger that by moving in bed, and I don't want all of my lights to turn on, necessarily.                                                                                                                        |
| 27:18      | But if I use a specific one that just looks for motion under the bed, and it turns out the Xiaomi motion sensor, again, I'll put a link in the show notes for that.                                                                                                      |
| 27:27      | It's tiny. I got one today. It's like the size of my thumb, like the size of like from the knuckles to the end of my nail.                                                                                                                                               |
| 27:35      | Now, I don't have particularly big hands, but it is a very small motion sensor. And so that's great.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:42      | It's currently I've got one perched on the curtain rail in my hallway because I have a curtain in front of my front door to block out light from outside and block my light into going outside.                                                                          |
| 27:52      | Now, do you do you get out of bed on the same side all the time? No, not necessarily.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:57      | But these motion sensors are so tiny and also so cheap that I would totally be willing to invest in two of them.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 28:04      | So pointed to where your feet land and you probably get exactly exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 28:10      | And I've got some cabinets next to my bed that I could actually just kind of mount them to like sort of facing forwards, which would like on the side very close to the ground, which could work quite nicely.                                                           |
| 28:21      | So I'll have to think about it and get back to people in a future episode if I do that.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:26      | But I'm toying with that idea. But I'm finding motion sensors work fairly well, though I have had to branch out in a few cases.                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:33      | So I have vibration sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:36      | And I tweeted a while ago about trying this with my tumble dryer and my washer.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:40      | And I did have them on my tumble dryer and my washer for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:44      | But the problem is, is [[HomeKit]] doesn't run an automation when motion ends.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 28:50      | So what you can do is you can trigger an automation when motion starts, which a vibration sensor comes through as motion, which is quite logical.                                                                                                                        |
| 28:59      | But when it ends, you can't have it do something, which is a shame.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 29:04      | So the most that you can do is sort of try and turn it off, but it depends on then what kind of motion sensor you have.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 29:10      | If it's constantly updating and looking for motion, or if it's only looking for motion after it's found motion and then waited for the motion to end.                                                                                                                    |
| 29:19      | And things got quite hacky. I was running shortcuts, like back to back looping them.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:25      | I was going to suggest like a timer. So as soon as it triggers, you start a timer.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:30      | Yeah. So in the end, I switched my washer and my dryer. I've got Eve smart plugs now.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:34      | I'm still working on that. I don't have a solution to check whether or not my washer or my dryer finished.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:38      | But at least I know how much energy they're using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:41      | And I should probably be more economical with how often I use a tumble dryer, it seems.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 29:46      | But so what I've got is I then had these two vibration sensors, which I didn't need, except I realised that there are motion sensor.                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:55      | And every so often, like when I'm sitting here in my office, my motion sensor will occasionally think, oh, hey, like she's gone away.                                                                                                                                    |
| 30:02      | Because I'm sitting here and I'm not necessarily moving a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:05      | Like I can be typing or something, but that's not enough to trigger a motion sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:09      | And so I'm sitting here podcasting or doing something and then suddenly the lights turn off.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30:14      | Yeah. That's not a good feeling to suddenly be sitting in the dark.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30:18      | And that happened a few times and I realised a vibration sensor is a motion sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30:23      | And so I stuck one to the underside of my office chair and it's a motion sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:29      | And of course, my office chair moves a little bit, you know, when I'm sitting here moving around just because I'm getting comfy.                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:35      | Or as I'm talking to you, you know, I'm kind of like, you know, tapping my feet or, you know, wriggling my ankle or something.                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:42      | And that means that there's just enough motion to trigger that as motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 30:46      | Yeah. I had the same thing back when I had a studio before the pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:51      | I had a motion sensor light in there because that was space that I controlled.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:55      | And when I walked in the room, the lights turned on and when I walked out, they turned off.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:59      | But I had the same problem where I, because once I get into kind of work mode, I can go hours just in the same position.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31:07      | And it would, I looked at it as an excuse to get up and take a bathroom break or go get a glass of water or something.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:14      | When the lights start turning off on you, that means you've been working too long.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:17      | Yes, yes, it can do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:19      | But sometimes you can't necessarily get up and get a glass of water while you're in the middle of a podcast.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:23      | I mean, I could, but I should probably let you know first, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31:26      | Instead of just wandering off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:28      | But yeah, so I stuck one to my office chair and that was great.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:33      | And then I saw somebody on Reddit post their home automation setup in the home kits up Reddit.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:40      | And wow, there was a whole load of stuff in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:44      | I was seriously impressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 31:46      | And what I was really impressed by was this person has a mailbox and they put a vibration sensor on their mailbox so they know when they get mail.                                                                                                                       |
| 31:55      | And I thought, well, I don't have a mailbox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:57      | I've got a letterbox where the postman puts things through into my place.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:02      | And I stuck a vibration sensor on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:05      | So every time that moves, it sends me a notification by a push cut say, you got mail.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:10      | And it works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:12      | It's really nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 32:13      | I could have it run an automation that says get post or something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 32:17      | But I like the film title reference in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:21      | And I'm fine with just a notification because I don't need it to constantly remind me, you know, at some point,                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:27      | sooner or later, I'll go into the hallway. I'll have to because the bathrooms at the end of it and see that there's post.                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:33      | But it's great to just get that notification so that you know, you know, if there was a strange noise, oh, it's because the post was delivered.                                                                                                                          |
| 32:41      | And that works really well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 32:43      | And that just sticks on there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:45      | As a tip, if you're playing with something like a vibration sensor, which in my case, again, I got Aqara ones.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:52      | They're very small and very cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 32:54      | I stock them all on with masking tape first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 32:57      | And if you're considering sticking things anywhere, be this NFC tags or sensors of some kind,                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:03      | I would highly, highly, highly recommend using masking tape first because these usually only come with one sticky thing.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33:10      | All the Aqara things come with two sets of sticky things, which is great.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 33:13      | But still, if you use one and then you realise that you've positioned your door sensor wrong and that it doesn't always trigger or that, you know,                                                                                                                       |
| 33:21      | you've misaligned things that's too far apart or not close enough together to work, then you'll have wasted a set of sticky things.                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:28      | They come off cleanly in my experience, but it's nice to try the masking tape approach first.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:33      | Yeah, and I'll, I use, I have a white roll of gaff tape, which does the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:38      | Yeah, something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 33:39      | Just, you know, a temporary solution for fixing things before permanently doing so is definitely my advice there.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 33:46      | I like the idea of a vibration sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33:48      | I've never used one before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33:50      | My mailbox is far enough away from my house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:53      | I think it would probably never get a signal back, but what a great idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:58      | If you've got a close mailbox or attached in, you know, to your door, just put a sensor on it. Nice.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34:05      | Yeah, yeah, it works really well for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:07      | And, you know, the other thing that I've got in my hallway and in my living room, and these are inside my house to be clear.                                                                                                                                             |
| 34:14      | They're not outside of my house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 34:16      | The EU has some fairly strict privacy laws, and I did not want to start recording people out, you know, who are just adjacent to my house, who have legitimate reasons and business for being there.                                                                     |
| 34:26      | So I have a little security camera in my hallway and one in my living room, and they only stream when I'm at home, but it allows me to just pop in and check and see, oh, yeah, you know, there's a pile of posts on the floor.                                          |
| 34:37      | Great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:38      | Okay, so I want to use a vibration sensor too, but I don't know where I can, given my situation, but I just had an idea.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:44      | We've got this little leather strap that hangs off the back door with bells on it, you know, for the dog.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:50      | So whenever she needs to go out and do her business, she just taps on the bell and the bell rings.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:55      | But sometimes I'm in the other room and I don't hear the bell.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34:59      | You see where I'm going with this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:01      | Yes, I'm seeing that there could be potential accidents and unhappy people in your life, including yourself if somebody does not hear the bell.                                                                                                                          |
| 35:08      | Yeah, so I'll just put a motion sensor on the strap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:11      | They're pretty small, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 35:13      | Yeah, they're very small.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 35:15      | If people are familiar with the tiles that attach to your keys, like the small older ones, back when the batteries weren't replaceable, it's around about that size.                                                                                                     |
| 35:25      | They also have temperature and humidity sensors, which are similar size.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:29      | And they're great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:31      | I love them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 35:33      | So I'll just attach one to the strap, the dog hits it then, but I guess I would have to do it through a...                                                                                                                                                               |
| 35:41      | I couldn't just do a notification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:43      | I probably would have to do it through a server, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35:47      | Yeah, so in the case of the Aqara things, if you want to just try a vibration sensor, you are also going to have to buy the hub.                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:55      | Now, they have US and EU versions of the hub, as well as the Chinese version.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:00      | But they don't yet have a UK version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:03      | So for people here in the UK, like me, you are going to have to buy a foreign one and use an adapter.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:08      | So I decided to get the Chinese one and run it because this way you get access to a few more devices, which I thought for scientific research purposes,                                                                                                                  |
| 36:19      | aka automators, I would do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:22      | But there's an EU one as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:24      | So you'd have to buy that too, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:26      | And that adds a price to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:30      | But you can just convert any automation to a shortcut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 36:33      | And then have it do get contents of URL and talk to, say, push over or any of those services.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:39      | Boxcar, I think, is still running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:41      | I personally just use push cut for everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:45      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:46      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:49      | Yeah, it's pretty good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:50      | And speaking of notifications from things, I also from Aqara bought buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:56      | These are called mini switches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:58      | These are larger than the temperature and humidity and vibration sensors that you can get.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:04      | But they're a reasonable size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:07      | And I now have smart doorbells without video because, you know, as mentioned earlier, I don't want to be filming people without their permission.                                                                                                                        |
| 37:16      | You know, if they're all my property, I figured that's fair game, but technically in front of my front door and my garden door is not necessarily my property.                                                                                                           |
| 37:24      | So I have smart doorbells now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:28      | And these are from Aqara.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 37:30      | They connect to the Aqara hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:32      | And inside the Aqara app, you can have it do automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:36      | So when the button is pushed, it will then make a ding dong sound very, very original and aware.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:42      | And they also have a notification feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:44      | Now, the slight problem with this is I've noticed the notification is a little bit slow.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 37:50      | So I'll hear the ding dong and it'll take a good couple of seconds before I see the notification on my phone that a certain door has had the doorbell pressed.                                                                                                           |
| 37:58      | So I currently have one of these buttons going ding dong and the other one making a knock, knock, knock sound just to help me audibly identify the difference.                                                                                                           |
| 38:08      | So sometimes these notifications could be a little bit slow, but it works really well.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:13      | And the other I got a third button as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:15      | That's on my bedside cabinet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 38:16      | It's stuck to the back of a key charger actually, so I can press it once when I go to bed and run a good night scene,                                                                                                                                                    |
| 38:22      | which turns off all the lights in the house and closes all the blinds and things like that and turns off the dehumidifier.                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:27      | And then I press it twice in the morning and it puts up blinds and turns on some lights and things like that.                                                                                                                                                            |

| 38:38      | What's the point in automating the tedious tasks in your life if you don't have instant access to those automations at the tip of your fingers?                                                                                                                          |
| 38:45      | Fast Scripts is a supercharged script menu for your Mac that makes it easy to organise and run your scripts.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:51      | By defining global or app-specific keyboard shortcuts, you can customise the behaviours of all your most used Mac apps.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:57      | You can even use it to override default keyboard shortcuts in many apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 39:01      | The best part is, Fast Scripts is completely free to use with up to 10 keyboard shortcuts,                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 39:06      | so you can use it as a quick fix for your most urgent needs,                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:09      | and when you decide you want more than 10 shortcuts, unlock premium functionality with a one-time payment of $25.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:16      | A tool like Fast Scripts is useful for more than just keyboard shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:20      | I love the fact that I have this tiny little menu up in my menu bar,                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:24      | and yes, when I click on it, it comes with a whole bunch of already existing [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]].                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 39:30      | That's the beauty of it. You don't need to have already written [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]] to use Fast Scripts.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:36      | You can download them from the Internet and try the built-in ones,                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:39      | like having a folder action to duplicate an image as a JPEG. That's already there.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:46      | If you've used Fast Scripts, then you'll know why this is so great,                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:50      | and I'd highly recommend that you go ahead and check it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 40:13      | All right. Now, Rose, you've talked a couple times about UK laws prohibiting you from putting your cameras outside,                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:20      | which I find kind of funny because...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 40:22      | Well, I don't know if they necessarily prohibit you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:25      | I mean, we have more cameras in this country than most other places.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:28      | No, that was my point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 40:29      | I don't want to be upsetting people by putting a camera somewhere where other people who are legitimately                                                                                                                                                                |
| 40:35      | living here and parking their cars outside because that's where their assigned spaces are,                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:40      | are being filmed and they aren't necessarily happy with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 40:44      | Now, there's also, as far as I'm concerned, I don't have any worries about security.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:50      | It was a case of I was podcasting a little while ago and I heard a noise in the hallway                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:55      | and I didn't know what it was, but I was in the middle of a video podcast,                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:58      | so I couldn't exactly get up and just go check it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:01      | You know, as I might break quickly, it would have been a bit odd if I just sort of walked out the room                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:05      | and checked what the noise was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:07      | So that was also prime day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 41:09      | So I bought a couple of cameras being slightly panicked and have those set up so I can just stream them.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:14      | And I use the HomeCam app so I can just open that up and see what's on both of my cameras at any time,                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:20      | which is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:22      | Well, the thing, the joke I was going to make is every time I've been in the UK,                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:25      | I can't get over how there are cameras everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 41:28      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:29      | I mean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 41:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:31      | But either way, so that's one place where I've gone down the rabbit hole in the last year.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 41:36      | Anker, the company that makes the accessories and batteries I like,                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:41      | has a line of security products that they sell under the name brand EufyEUFY.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 41:47      | So I went ahead and started buying some of these and they're very reasonably priced                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:51      | in comparison to like a Logitech or some of the other people in the space.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 41:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:57      | You know, like a Logitech camera is close to $200.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 42:01      | A Eufy camera is, you know, you can get them sometimes on sale for like $20 or $30.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 42:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:07      | You know, you can get them, you know, sometimes I think the standard price on the non-rotating camera,                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:11      | indoor camera is like $40.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:14      | So I bought several of these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 42:16      | I bought some of their battery-powered ones too that I put on the outside of the house.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 42:20      | And now I've got, my house is like, you can't really get near my house without getting taped.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 42:26      | So there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:27      | I mean, backyard, front yard, doors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 42:30      | I've got some indoor as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 42:33      | Like you, they're only set to stream while anybody that is like authorised to be here is here.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:39      | But when we leave, if I want, I can have them record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:43      | And I have, I have maxed out my five camera limit from [[HomeKit]], you know, how Apple has the secure camera.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:53      | So I've used those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 42:54      | And I think it's been working great for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 42:57      | One thing I wanted to report in on this episode was, you know, how well does [[HomeKit]] secure video work really?                                                                                                                                                           |
| 43:04      | And my answer is it works pretty good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:07      | I mean, it does record the snippets of people coming and going on those cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 43:12      | It saves it to the Apple cloud, which I believe is more secure and doesn't cost anything extra if you're already paying for iCloud storage.                                                                                                                              |
| 43:20      | They have added the ability to add safe and, you know, ignore zones in essence to your camera.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 43:29      | Like the one that points out from the front door, we have a flag hanging from our, near our front door.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 43:34      | You know, usually it has like the, whatever the season is, if it's Christmas or, you know, Valentine's or whatever, we have little flags we hang.                                                                                                                        |
| 43:41      | And those flags are terrible about triggering motion on these cameras and killing the battery.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 43:46      | So I was able to like block out that section and it works fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:50      | The one piece of this that Apple has promised that I don't think they've delivered on is face detection, which I really wanted to work.                                                                                                                                  |
| 43:57      | Oh, that's working for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 43:58      | Oh, really?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 43:59      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:00      | Yeah, that is working for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:02      | So I also have eufy cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:04      | I got the pen and tilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 44:05      | Now you can only pen and tilt inside the eufy app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:09      | You can't do that inside of the home app, but inside of the home app, I do indeed have face detection.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:15      | And also I have a portrait of Audrey Hepburn in my hallway, which every so often there's a false motion detection and there's like, oh, I found Audrey Hepburn.                                                                                                          |
| 44:24      | So I had to use an activity view to block out that section because I don't need random screenshots of Audrey Hepburn being sent to me.                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:33      | It's kind of funny though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:34      | It's a lovely picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:35      | But yeah, so I found that if I tap on the camera in the home app and then pop into the settings, I have face recognition.                                                                                                                                                |
| 44:42      | Now, I don't know if this is something that it depends on your camera firmware.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:48      | I believe it would be relatively logical if it was, but it might not be.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 44:53      | But it then accesses my photo library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:57      | And it gives me a button that says add names and photos, and if I tap on it, then I've got people here.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:05      | I've got myself, I've got my parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:06      | You're here, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:07      | Apparently I've got quite a few pictures of you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45:08      | And thanks to Relay FM's fifth anniversary, which was last year now, then I have a lot of pictures of Relay FM hosts.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:16      | So if anybody turns up at my house from Relay, I'll recognise you.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:20      | Or at least my camera as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:22      | Yes, so that's there and that works, at least it works for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:27      | It recognised me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:28      | Have you tried using that to trigger an automation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:32      | I have not tried using it to trigger an automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:35      | I did not know that it was supposed to be able to trigger an automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:40      | And I'm not seeing an option anywhere for, I mean, the camera's work is motion detectors as well.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:48      | So they can detect motion in a room for you and trigger an automation based on that.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:52      | But I've never seen an automation based on a specific person being recognised.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:57      | So unfortunately, the mailman showing up is not necessarily going to work for that.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:02      | So as they explained it to us, we're supposed to get a notification if someone we know is at the door and I cannot get that to work.                                                                                                                                     |
| 46:11      | My camera's on the wrong side of my door for that to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 46:14      | So I've not been able to test that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:16      | I did leave my phone on purpose at my parents place the other day and came back to break into my own house.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 46:23      | To be clear, I turned off the alarm system first, so I wasn't really breaking it.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:28      | I just wanted to see if the facial recognition worked and it did recognise me in the recording.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 46:34      | But I don't know if that was, I'm running beta software on literally everything I can.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 46:41      | So that might be a beta feature that works and isn't necessarily in production or something else.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:47      | But I, yeah, I have unfortunately not seen any automations related to this either, which is a real shame.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 46:55      | Now, do you have a UV, which UV camera do you have? Is it a 2K camera or?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 47:00      | Yeah, it's a 2K pan and tilt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 47:02      | Okay, so mine is not 2K. It's the one before that. And I'm wondering if maybe that's the problem.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:09      | Possibly, I don't know. I know that mine are pretty new cameras and they are frequently on sale.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 47:19      | So I believe it is Black Friday as the show releases or week before Black Friday as the show releases.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 47:27      | So people should check to see if there's Black Friday deals or Cyber Monday deals for them because UV stuff often goes on sale.                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:35      | And I've personally found the bill quality to be, you know, very good. And they are, you know, pretty cheap in the first place.                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:41      | So if you can get it on sale, it's even better if you're looking for something like that already, of course.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 47:46      | Yeah. And just to add on with UV, I like that they're inexpensive, but they're also good quality.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:53      | Some of them store data right on device, like I have a couple of the outdoor utility like UV cameras now.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 48:02      | And these replace, you know, a lot of people have these lights that hang off the side of their house.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 48:06      | And they've usually got two lights pointing out of them. They're kind of like security lights.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 48:11      | And historically, those are motion sensor lights. People put them up around their house and motion triggers them.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 48:17      | But the UV does that as well as having a camera in it that shoots a video.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 48:22      | And that one stores the video right on the device, right inside the utility light, but you have access to it obviously through the app.                                                                                                                                  |
| 48:31      | And then they all have other ones like the doorbell one, the wired doorbell UV camera that I have stores to a UV like central unit, you know, that's inside the house with that you put a memory stick in.                                                               |
| 48:44      | So you can, you can store it either in your house or out, but you don't have to pay UV to store it for you.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 48:51      | And since I have more than five cameras, I've got Apple storing data from the five kind of essential cameras and the rest of them just going through kind of the UV storage system.                                                                                      |
| 49:01      | And I find the UV app isn't terrible either. So like I can be working on my Mac and then have my iPad below it just with the UV app open and it's like a full, you know, visual field of the entire house.                                                               |
| 49:15      | What's going on if I want to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49:17      | Yeah, if you have cameras from multiple providers or you just are looking for something other than the provider's app, I'm personally using a home cam.                                                                                                                  |
| 49:25      | I believe this is from Pierce media. The developer's name is Aaron Pierce.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 49:29      | And that will show you it'll just tile the different cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 49:33      | So I can literally pop that open right now I can see my my hall camera my lounge camera.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 49:38      | And if I tap on a camera as well, it'll do a full screen of that. And I also at the bottom have a little toggle where I have access to the different devices in that area that I could turn on and off.                                                                  |
| 49:49      | So for example, in my hallway, I can turn on the overhead light.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 49:53      | And I suddenly go from the night vision mode, which is kind of black and whitish to a full colour version, including Audrey Hepburn, who's got an orange umbrella.                                                                                                        |
| 50:02      | There you go. All right, let's talk about these blinds. You've been teasing me with your blinds now for months.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 50:08      | Yes. And I love my smart blinds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 50:11      | So IKEA make smart blinds. There are a couple of other companies out there who also make smart blinds.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:18      | They vary at different price points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 50:20      | There's also a company whose name I've briefly forgotten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 50:23      | I think it's Somfy SOM FY who make adapters that fit onto blind chains, which are home kit compatible.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:31      | I looked at the prices for those and decided that if I had to play blinds and those, it was the same price pretty much just to get the IKEA blinds straight up.                                                                                                          |
| 50:40      | Now, I'm in a position of privilege. I live in Europe where IKEA smart blinds appear to be widely available.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 50:47      | I just walked into the store, grabbed the three that I wanted and walked out.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 50:51      | And that was it. Well, I paid as well, to be clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 50:55      | But I've heard that people are having issues sourcing them in the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:59      | If you need 10 or more, then apparently you can place an order with IKEA and they'll sort that for you.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:04      | But if you only need a couple, then it's a bit trickier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 51:07      | But I've got the IKEA smart blinds. They don't have any chains on them.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:11      | They have a little battery that you pop out and you charge with micro USB, comes with a micro USB charger.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 51:17      | And the whole thing is set up so you don't actually need the IKEA smart hub to use the blind.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51:22      | It comes with a little button, which you can just stick wherever you like and use that.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:26      | And it comes with a repeater as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:28      | I wanted to use mine with the smart hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 51:31      | I want my blinds except in my office to automatically close the sunset.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:34      | Here in my office, I don't want it to close the sunset unless I'm not at home or if I'm not recording.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 51:40      | So that gets a little bit tricky, which I do with the Home Plus app.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 51:44      | But I had to pair it with the IKEA smart home app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 51:49      | Now, I have many comments on the IKEA smart home app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:52      | But to say it is not my favourite app in the world would be an understatement.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51:56      | Unfortunately, it's slightly buggy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 51:58      | And adding, particularly my kitchen blind took four days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:05      | So I had to reset things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:07      | I had to un-pair things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:08      | I had to repair things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:09      | And eventually I discovered the trick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 52:11      | So the IKEA app says, wait 30 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 52:14      | Do not wait 30 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:16      | Make sure your phone is set to not auto lock and just leave it open in the IKEA app.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:20      | Go off and have a bubble bath and come back and you'll be good.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:23      | Because it took a very, very, very long time to find the blind.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:27      | Pairing the button is relatively easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 52:29      | Pairing the repeater relatively easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 52:31      | Once the repeater has paired then to the blind as part of the setup,                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:35      | you have to use a repeater as part of the setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 52:38      | But they ship one with a blind so you don't need an extra one.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 52:41      | You can actually unplug it and just not plug it in if your place is small enough.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 52:46      | And also the outlets function as repeater.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 52:49      | So it's a solid system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:51      | But you have to pair the button to the hub,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:53      | pair the repeater to the button,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 52:55      | and then pair the button to the blind in that order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:58      | And it just kept hanging on the blind step for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:00      | But eventually I just left it for a very, very, very long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:03      | I went off, I had dinner, I watched a show,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:05      | and then came back and it said, hey, I found your kitchen blind.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:08      | It's in the [[HomeKit]] app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:10      | And I said, thank you, because the IKEA app and have not opened it since.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 53:14      | So now with those, are you able to just also pull them down without using an app?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 53:19      | No, I'm not, but they do ship with buttons,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:23      | which I have just stuck sort of on the window frame pretty much                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:28      | so that you can easily press the button to have them come down.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:31      | They're not the sort of blind that you could pull down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 53:34      | I think you would damage the mechanism if you did that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 53:37      | Yeah, my family would destroy those blinds in less than a month                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:40      | because they would just walk up and pull them down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 53:43      | That's a shame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:44      | I mean, I find they roll like really high up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 53:46      | So if they're rolled up, then you're not going to necessarily,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:50      | you're going to have to reach right around into the back to pull that bar to get it.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:54      | And also, I just have it run automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:58      | So theoretically, nobody should ever need to touch the blind,                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:02      | though I am looking at, I found a blog post the other day,                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 54:05      | which was talking about Homebridge and Automatically Closing Blinds                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:09      | based on the degree of the sun and whether or not it's sunny outside,                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 54:13      | which is an interesting project for a future time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:16      | Yeah, I'll say one thing, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:18      | IKEA is the first company that made them affordable                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:21      | because I looked into them a couple times and they're like ridiculously expensive,                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:26      | like hundreds of dollars for one blind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 54:29      | Whereas IKEA's, I believe they're like the $50 range to get one.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 54:33      | No, I think they're more in the 100 plus range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 54:37      | It depends on the size of the blind that you need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:39      | Obviously, the wider the blind, the more expensive it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:43      | I got very, very lucky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 54:45      | Two of my windows perfectly fit the IKEA blind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 54:49      | And technically, you are not supposed to cut the IKEA blinds down.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:53      | They do not support this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:54      | Of course, if you then cut it down and they say that you can't do that,                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 54:57      | then you can't return it if something goes wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:59      | But I did have to buy a slightly larger one for my bedroom                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 55:02      | and cut it down with my dad's assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 55:05      | My dad was very helpful during the entire redecorating process.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 55:09      | And we cut it down, we filed off the metal end                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 55:12      | so that there weren't any sharp bits flying around                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 55:14      | that might poke somebody and give somebody a metal splinter,                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:17      | put everything together, and it works great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:19      | I'm very happy with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:21      | But they're not the cheapest,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 55:23      | especially compared to the fact that you can get a regular blind                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:26      | for a very cheap price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:28      | Yeah, I think I was thinking about, because I bought the IKEA blinds,                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:31      | but not with the robot in them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 55:33      | But either way, that's still less expensive                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 55:36      | than any competitor that I've ever seen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55:39      | Yeah, I find, you know, if you do want smart blinds,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 55:42      | that these are the most affordable way to do it,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:46      | which doesn't mean to say that it's cheap,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 55:48      | but it does mean to say that I can lie in bed and press a button                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:51      | and have my blinds close or open,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:54      | and I don't need to think about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 55:56      | And I can just integrate that into other things as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55:59      | So it sounds that my blinds just close                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:01      | and I don't need to worry about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 56:03      | And that, for me, is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 56:05      | Now, do you also have the ability to have your...                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 56:08      | I'm sure you have the ability to, I don't know if you're doing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 56:10      | Can you have your blinds just open up in the morning                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 56:12      | as you wake up? Is that something you're doing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 56:14      | Yes, so if you use the sleep integration in shortcuts,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:19      | and I'm just double-checking exactly what this is,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:22      | when waking up, that's the name of the trigger,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 56:24      | I actually have that run a couple of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 59:37      | I think we're already there, but there's more nerdy to come, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 59:40      | Exactly. One of the things you've done is Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 59:43      | We used Homebridge like years ago,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 59:45      | and I got frustrated with it every time there was an update.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 59:48      | I'd have to spend a half hour kind of getting it working again,                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 59:51      | and my solution ultimately was just gradually I bought only things                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 59:55      | that worked with [[HomeKit]], and I don't have Homebridge anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 59:58      | But what's the state of Homebridge now and how's it working for you?                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:00:02   | Homebridge now, by default, installs with a graphical user interface,                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:05   | which means that instead of having to just edit a JSON file                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:09   | and make sure that your brackets are all right                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:11   | and your spacing is all right and your commas are all correct,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:14   | you can at least attempt to do everything through a pretty web user interface,                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:19   | so it opens up the web browser on your machine,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:22   | and then you'll do things through there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:24   | Now, not every single plugin has been updated to support this,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:27   | so sometimes when you're looking at the config for a plugin,                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:30   | you'll be able to just click a thing and add a device                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:32   | and click a thing and add a device and click a thing and add a device,                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:00:35   | and other times you'll open up the config and it'll be like,                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:37   | please type your JSON in here and you'll be there going,                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:41   | that's not quite as friendly as I was hoping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:00:43   | But what I'm using it for, aside from my Logitech Harmony,                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:00:48   | I am not using it to add devices that I physically have into [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:56   | I'm using it to add fake devices to [[HomeKit]] and also some other things.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:02   | So I do have on my Raspberry Pi the same one that's running Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:05   | I also have PiHole, which is a DNS that blocks ads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:09   | So that's set up on my Eero, which is a [[HomeKit]] router,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:12   | which we'll get to in a moment, possibly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:01:15   | So I've got that, and I have a button for that in [[HomeKit]],                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:01:20   | so I can actually turn off the ad blocking if a website's not working through my phone.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:24   | And I can say, you know, turn PiHole off or turn PiHole on,                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:01:28   | and it will do that, which is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:30   | And the other thing that I'm using it for,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:01:33   | the big plug-in that I'm using is called dummy switches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:37   | And dummy switches are exactly what they sound like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:39   | They add fake switches into [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:42   | But I use these for statuses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:01:45   | So I actually, sorry, I lied earlier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:48   | I've not just used it to add my Logitech Harmony,                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:50   | I also used it to add my Eufy RoboVac to [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:55   | But this involves setting up an Android simulator                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:57   | and a whole bunch of other things,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:01:59   | so I'm not sure I can classify that as worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:02   | It now means when I leave the house, my RoboVac will run                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:05   | unless it's already run that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:02:07   | And the way that I do unless it already ran today                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:02:10   | is through a dummy switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:02:12   | So whenever my RoboVac runs,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:02:14   | it turns on a dummy switch that says vacuum ran.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:18   | And then at 23.59 at night,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:02:20   | there's an automation that runs that turns that switch back to off.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:02:25   | And so then when I leave the house for the day,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:28   | or, you know, I go outside,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:02:30   | then if there's nobody else here,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:02:33   | because my parents also added to this just in case,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:02:36   | then it will start my RoboVac in running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:39   | But I use the Home+ app to say,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:02:42   | to add a condition, which is,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:02:44   | and Robot Cleaned is off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:46   | Because otherwise, if I go out for the day and it cleans                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:49   | and I come back and I go off to do another errand,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:02:52   | then my RoboVac will run again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:02:54   | and I haven't necessarily emptied it,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:02:56   | which means that it can then start sort of leaving fluff                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:58   | and carpet, which is an interesting mess to get home to,                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:01   | especially when you didn't really need it to run twice in one day.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:04   | So I use it for my Robot vacuum status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:03:07   | I also use it for a bedtime status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:10   | So when I get into bed and I run my good night shortcut                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:12   | by pressing the button on my bedside cabinet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:15   | it turns on a dummy switch called bedtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:17   | And what this does primarily is it disables my motion sensors,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:21   | so that if I move in the night,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:03:23   | it's not going to turn on the lights in my bedroom,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:26   | until I turn that off, at which point,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:03:29   | it will then automatically use motion sensors                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:32   | and the light levels to turn on my lights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:34   | And that is great because there's nothing worse than saying,                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:38   | oh yeah, you know, I'll just have motion sensors turn on my lights                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:41   | anytime between 7am and 10pm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:44   | And then one day you want to have a lion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:46   | and you want to sleep past 7, but every time you move,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:03:49   | you accidentally turn on the lights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:03:51   | That's not fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:03:53   | That is a very fast way to get yourself in the doghouse                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:55   | if you are living with other people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:03:57   | And it's also a very fast way to put yourself in the doghouse                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:00   | when you're DIYing all of this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:02   | I got very frustrated with then lying awake in bed,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:04:06   | well, you know, awake when I didn't want to be awake                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:09   | because I'd programmed myself into a corner                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:04:11   | and found dummy switches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:04:13   | And I use this for a couple of other things as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:15   | I have a working switch, which I trigger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:19   | when I'm physically doing my day job,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:22   | or when I'm recording, like I'm recording with you right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:25   | And that disables the turning off thing with the motion in my office.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:30   | So that this means that if it detects motion in another room,                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:34   | then it won't turn off the lights and the heating in here.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:37   | Because this way, if I do get up to grab a glass of water or something,                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:41   | I don't come up and find that my heater turned off                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:43   | and my lights turned off when they didn't need to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:47   | So there are quite a few things for those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:50   | And I'm also experimenting with using it for different people.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:04:53   | But considering the whole pandemic situation,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:55   | that's not necessary yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:04:57   | Same with the guest switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:04:59   | I've seen that used by a lot of people who use Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:05:03   | They have a dummy switch called Guest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:05   | And this means that when they run things,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:05:07   | run automations, if Guest is false,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:10   | then they'll turn off all the lights everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:12   | But if Guest is true, they won't turn off the lights in the area                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:15   | where the Guest is because, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:17   | that would put them in the dark and possibly, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:20   | result in upset people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:22   | That's interesting because you're really using it                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:05:24   | to solve a software problem, not a hardware problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:26   | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:27   | And that's why I think Homebridge, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:05:30   | can really, you know, add to [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:34   | It's not just doing things like adding devices                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 01:07:02   | Now, I've had some issues because it's supposed                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:04   | to also support shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:06   | I found that on different devices,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:08   | I can run and it's very annoying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:07:12   | So instead, I am using the HTTP switch to run                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:16   | and if this and that applet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:18   | which then triggers the SwitchBot through the SwitchBot Hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:21   | Now, this is a Rube Goldberg machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:23   | It's held together with duct tape and prayers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:25   | I would not recommend this for anybody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:27   | I am just trying this and it's fun for me,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:30   | but if my kitchen light didn't turn off,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:32   | it would not be the end of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:34   | For some people, if they did not get their coffee in the morning,                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:07:36   | they would be having a very, very bad day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:38   | So I would recommend experimenting with this yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:42   | and seeing what your level of tolerance is                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:44   | for things not working as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07:47   | But I am trying that with the HTTP switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:50   | Yeah, just listening to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:51   | Yeah, it works for me,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:53   | but I would not recommend that anybody else dive into this                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:56   | unless they're prepared to spend potentially hours                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:58   | troubleshooting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:07:59   | Yeah, it's just a little thing you described.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:01   | I'm like, that's going to work like half the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:03   | I mean, for me, it's turning my kitchen light off 100% of the time,                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:08:07   | but that's not necessarily something I can guarantee                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:11   | for other people because I have some other stuff running as well                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 01:08:18   | So yeah, it's certainly interesting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 01:10:01   | So, I originally had an Echo Dot and a Symphonisk,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 01:10:13   | but I have found that airplane                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 01:10:26   | which I'm pleased to report is working much better for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 01:10:31   | or the ISP router I had before that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:34   | But I decided with the announcement of the HomePod Mini                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:38   | that I would happily return my IKEA Symphonisk speaker                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:42   | because I'd only been using it for a few days at this point                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:44   | and I had all the box and everything,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:46   | and IKEA let you return stuff for up to a year,                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:48   | which is very generous of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:50   | That's if you have their loyalty card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:53   | So, I returned the Symphonisk, ordered a HomePod Mini,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:55   | it arrived today, so I've not played with it much,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:10:58   | but it's in my kitchen, it's away from my cooker                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 01:11:07   | and that is now going to be my kitchen speaker for music                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 01:11:15   | which in my test today seemed to do what I needed as required                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 01:11:24   | because that's great and adding things to my shopping list                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:27   | because I have a reminder list called Shopping List                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:29   | and every time I open OmniFocus,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:31   | I have it pull in all the things from that                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:33   | with the open app action,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:11:34   | so I can add stuff to my shopping list on my HomePod Mini                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:11:37   | and then it will just get slurped into OmniFocus                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:40   | at a later date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:42   | Yeah, I would also recommend using it to try                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11:44   | and trigger some of your home automation stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:47   | I mean, I find that I use the HomePods to turn lights on                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:50   | and turn the air conditioning on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:52   | and all sorts of home automation related tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:11:57   | and it works just fine for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:59   | Yeah, I do that too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:00   | I have full-size HomePods in my office                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:02   | and living room that I have had for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:12:04   | I got both of them sort of refurbished in Austria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:12:07   | They were returned to an electronics store                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:09   | even though the HomePod wasn't available in Austria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:12   | I'm guessing somebody bought them in Germany                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:12:14   | and returned them to the Austrian branch or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:16   | So I got mine fortunately a bit cheaper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:19   | and they're great for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:21   | So I've got another HomePod Mini on the way from my bedroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:12:25   | It's just not arrived yet, which is sad,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:27   | but it came with a regular USB-C charger in the box,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:30   | the 20 watt one, which is very interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:33   | I did not realise I thought it was a molded plug on it                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:35   | the same as the big ones, but I guess not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:38   | Well, I guess that allows it to be international easier, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:12:41   | Yeah, I guess that's one way                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:12:43   | and also it's also much easier to wrangle the cable                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:12:45   | because you only have to thread a USB-C plug                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:12:48   | through potentially very small gaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:50   | So in my bedroom,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:12:52   | I could take the shelves out of my cupboards to run the cable,                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:12:57   | but I can also just thread the USB-C cable down there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:59   | I already checked that today before I installed it in the kitchen.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:13:02   | Good. How does it sound?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:04   | I haven't talked to anybody yet that's actually listened to one.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:07   | I mean, I had it playing music in my kitchen for half an hour                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:11   | before we recorded the show                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:13:13   | and I was in and out cleaning and tidying and some other things.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:16   | So I've not given extensive testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:18   | To my ears, it sounds better than the symphonist guy had there,                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:21   | but that might also be because it's got in a different place there                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:13:25   | and I was playing different music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:13:28   | So for me, it sounds fine, but I am far from an audiophile.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:13:32   | I'm just somebody who likes to listen to music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:34   | Well, Rose, it sounds like you've got yourself set up for home automation.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:38   | Yes. I mean, I've got so many, like, nerdy things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:13:42   | So the dummy switches in Homebridge,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:44   | I've got one with an eight-hour timer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:46   | So when I turn my lava lamp on, it starts my eight-hour timer one                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:50   | and then the eight-hour timer will automatically turn my lava lamp off                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:53   | because I decided I need a lava lamp to make my life a little groovier.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:57   | And also it can't be on for more than eight hours                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:59   | because otherwise apparently they overheat                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:01   | and that's not good for them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:03   | So yeah, I've done a lot of things and it's great fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:07   | And I mean, for me, you know, I love tinkering with this stuff                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:11   | and playing with this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:14:12   | If you're not somebody who is prepared to invest                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:14:14   | a decent amount of time debugging,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:14:16   | then automating your entire house in one go is not something I'd recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:14:20   | Maybe do a room at a time or a problem at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:23   | But yeah, I've had a lot of fun                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:25   | and I've already bought some extra smart plugs for Christmas.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:28   | I went in on the IKEA Trout Free things                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:31   | because I was getting the blinds anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:33   | Their outlets are cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:35   | Their buttons are cheap as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:14:37   | The buttons sadly don't appear in [[HomeKit]], which is a real shame.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:40   | Neither do their motion sensors as a warning for people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:43   | But the buttons, sorry, the outlets do, their light bulbs do.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:48   | So I have coloured lights on either side of my bed                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:51   | on the night tables there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:52   | And I've got loads of outlets everywhere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:55   | because it's a great way of just turning things on enough                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:14:58   | without fiddling around, plugging stuff in,                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:01   | getting up and moving, you know, all those normal people things.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:15:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:05   | Well, my [[HomeKit]] setup hasn't changed much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:08   | I mean, I've talked about a lot on Mac Power users                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:11   | and, you know, we kind of covered yours today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:14   | The big changes in my life have been the eufye plug                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:17   | or the eufye camera system, which is...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:15:20   | I am very satisfied with it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:22   | and I hadn't been satisfied with my canaries in the past                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:25   | and I just feel like the eufye is the right mix for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:15:28   | It's not too expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:30   | It works with [[HomeKit]] secure video                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:32   | and even for the stuff that doesn't work with [[HomeKit]] secure video,                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:15:35   | it's still making video for me and their app is not terrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:39   | I'm not going to say it's great, but it's not terrible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:42   | The other big problem I solved recently was                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:45   | I have a little pond in the backyard that I installed years ago                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:15:49   | and there's a fountain in it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:15:51   | and there's some other stuff I run in the backyard that requires plugs,                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:54   | but, you know, the outdoor stuff usually pulls more voltage than you want                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:15:58   | and you want a waterproof plug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:00   | And I went through a whole series of those outdoor [[HomeKit]] plugs                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:16:04   | through Amazon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:06   | There were two or three different vendors that I bought from                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:08   | and none of them worked or they didn't work very long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:12   | You know, I'd try them and, like, after a week they'd stop working.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:16   | And we had Micah Sargent on Mac Power Users                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:21   | and he had recommended the iDevices outdoor plug                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:16:25   | and I bought that and it was $10 more than anything I could find.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:29   | It was just a little bit more expensive than stuff on Amazon,                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:16:32   | but I bought it directly from iDevices and it came                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:16:35   | and it, like, immediately solved the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:16:38   | So that's the other big [[HomeKit]] issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:41   | For outdoor plugs, I would recommend the iDevices outdoor plug.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:44   | But I'm inspired by you, Rose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:47   | I'm going to be setting up my dog pee automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:51   | Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:16:54   | I'm sure she'll appreciate that as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:56   | Everybody who would otherwise have to clean the floor in your house.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:59   | She doesn't get outside when she needs to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:02   | You've also got me thinking about motion sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:05   | Like, there are areas of the house I could probably pull off a motion sensor                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:08   | where it would not make everybody really angry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:17:11   | So I'm actually thinking bathrooms would be a good spot for a small motion sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:16   | And I think people would appreciate that when you walk in, the light turns on.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:20   | Yeah, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:23   | So I wanted to get Hiome occupancy sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:27   | That's H-I-O-M-E.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:29   | They make occupancy sensors that you put above a door                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:32   | and it will show up in [[HomeKit]] as somebody is in the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:37   | It's done through motion, but then the motion is on until everybody's left the room.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:17:41   | And it counts people in and counts people out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:43   | Now, a large dog can trigger this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:45   | because a large dog is approximately the same size as a small child, height-wise.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:49   | But they are pricey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:17:52   | And so I looked, I was very, very tempted, so unbelievably tempted to do it.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:58   | But I just couldn't justify the price, especially with shipping to the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:02   | And I wanted the battery once as well because I don't have outlets conveniently located next to my door.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:07   | And so it would have been quite pricey to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:18:11   | But that is a more reliable way of doing motion occupancy sensor                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:17   | than using motion sensors if there's more than one person in your house                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:18:21   | or more than two people and you need to negotiate things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:18:26   | That might be a solution for some people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:18:29   | I am hoping at some point they go on sale so I can buy them and test them.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:33   | But right now, I unfortunately do not have them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 01:19:50   | Alright, so we've got a beta of iOS 14.3 and the shortcuts team not surprisingly is still working hard.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:19:58   | We've got some new shortcuts coming with iOS 14.3. I thought it'd be fun to talk through some of them.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:03   | The first one is the long in absence change home screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:20:10   | Yes, change home screen background.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:20:12   | Change wallpaper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:20:13   | This came with iOS 13. We had it in beta one. We left it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:20:17   | I think we might have had it in beta 1.0 or 0.1, whatever it was and people left it.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:20:25   | Then I believe somebody must have found a security issue with it because they took it away from us and I was sad.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:20:32   | But it's back and we can change our wallpaper again and I'm looking forward to using the set wallpaper action.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:20:38   | So you can set wallpaper for your lock screen and or home screen and you can set it to an image and I'm looking forward to doing this as I change things throughout my day.                                                                                              |
| 01:20:49   | So for example, when I'm doing automators, I want an automators logo on my home screen when I'm recording nested folders.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:20:55   | I want the nested folders logo on my home screen when I'm working.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:20:58   | Well, I don't necessarily want my workload on my home screen, but I'd like something to remind me that I'm supposed to be doing my day job and similar.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:21:05   | And so I'm looking forward to doing some things with that and maybe even changing the background wallpaper on my phone throughout the week, you know, to different colours and things like that.                                                                          |
| 01:21:15   | Yeah, I had done a whole video on it when it was in beta. It was going to be part of the shortcuts field guide and it got very complicated.                                                                                                                              |
| 01:21:24   | I was pulling tasks out of OmniFocus and calendar events and I was basically creating like a daily status report wallpaper and then it would just end the morning and install that.                                                                                      |
| 01:21:34   | Well, now with widgets, that's really, I don't think necessary. The widgets do a better job of keeping you updated and get weather and your calendar events and OmniFocus and whatever else on your widgets.                                                             |
| 01:21:45   | So it's not as necessary, but I do like the idea, like you said, of kind of treating it like a context device just like we're doing with our Apple Watch faces where you have it automatically change the watch face based on what you're doing.                         |
| 01:21:58   | Even just like using colours, like if for automators to me is red, you know, because we have that nice red in our logo, whereas Mac Power Users is green and and focus is blue.                                                                                                 |
| 01:22:09   | I can, I can just do things like that. And I think it's going to be nice. And I'm glad it came back. I'd love to hear the story behind why it got delayed.                                                                                                               |
| 01:22:17   | I suspect it wasn't technical because they had it working just fine last year. But you know, who knows, maybe someday we'll hear the story.                                                                                                                              |
| 01:22:26   | Maybe we will. We I'm guessing we probably won't Apple tends to keep a lid on these things pretty well, but it's back. And yeah, I'm I'm really looking forward to seeing how people use this.                                                                           |
| 01:22:36   | So if you if you're using this or you plan on using it, please post in the forum thread for this episode and let us know how because I'm definitely going to be looking to to play with this.                                                                            |
| 01:22:46   | I'm thinking, David, I might do an advent calendar of iPhone lock screens and just have it set a different one every single day for me.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:22:56   | Nice. Nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:22:57   | That could be fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:22:58   | Or you could do the 12 days of Christmas and like you could have two trickle doves on the first day.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:23:02   | Oh, that would be fun. Yeah, that would be lovely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:23:06   | The then another change they're making this one made me so happy when I saw it is the ability to edit a calendar event.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:23:16   | Now, listeners may say, of course, they have that ability already, don't they? And I can tell you they do not.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:23:23   | I have written so many automations that involve me doing date math and creating a new event based on an old event and then deleting the old event.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:23:31   | It's just nuts that you couldn't just take an existing event and edit the start time or the end time or the location or whatever.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:23:38   | Yeah, and you had to use something like toolbox pro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:23:41   | And by the way, I've seen the developer of toolbox pro posting like they can go ahead and show look me on this because, you know, that's great.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:47   | That means that shortcuts is updating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:23:49   | So he had edit calendar event because there's also edit reminder and edit contact now dated so you can update, you know, your reminders the same way.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:23:57   | So instead of, you know, copying all the data out and, you know, changing that one thing you needed to change and then deleting it.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:24:04   | No, you can just go ahead and actually update your event, which is so great.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:24:09   | Amen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:11   | The other update was so you got contact reminders, calendar events that you can now change.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:24:20   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:24:21   | What about the this app trigger change?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:24:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:27   | So app triggers are now this, I believe it's predominantly for people who are making an entire home screen with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:24:35   | So those people who are putting like a button on their home screen, which has got a pretty male icon to open the mail app.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:24:42   | Now, downside of this is you don't get a notification badge indicator.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:24:45   | So if that's important to you, you shouldn't be doing that.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:24:48   | But basically what happened before is say it was the mail app, you tap on it, it would open shortcuts and then open the mail app.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:24:55   | Which as people who previously before iOS 13, I want to say use this will know it would open Safari and then open shortcuts and then open whatever app it was that you wanted it to open.                                                                                |
| 01:25:08   | So it was an improvement, but the stock apps no longer open shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:25:13   | They just go straight to whatever app that is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:25:15   | So that's mail, stocks, the tips app, the home app, you know, shortcuts itself, messages, phone.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:25:24   | All those apps, the apps that come preinstalled on your phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:25:28   | Photos is another one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:25:30   | Those will no longer open shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:25:32   | First, if you tap on a home screen icon, which just runs a shortcut with the open app action, it will go to those apps.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:25:38   | Now third party apps, like for example, Spark or Fantastical or [[Drafts]] or carrot or OmniFocus will still open the shortcuts app.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:25:46   | I do not know why Apple have chosen to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:25:50   | I'm presuming potentially something to do with security, but that's a guess.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:25:54   | But those apps still open shortcuts first, unfortunately, but the stock apps don't.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:26:00   | So that's cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:01   | I have a feeling that this one jumped to the top of the line with this update because of the popularity of these widget apps and how people are building their own home screens.                                                                                         |
| 01:26:11   | Oh yeah, I'm sure it did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:26:13   | And also, I mean, there's a lot of people that was their first experience or first exposure to shortcuts is, you know, just these launch app shortcuts that they're making to adjust their home screen.                                                                  |
| 01:26:23   | So I'm kind of glad it's bringing people in the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:26   | Yeah, me too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:26:27   | It's great to see, you know, what changes are being made to things based on how people are using stuff because I would think anybody ever expected                                                                                                                       |
| 01:26:35   | Widget Smith to go viral on TikTok. I genuinely didn't think I'd ever saw those words on a podcast, David, about developer.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:26:43   | I know their app went viral on TikTok, but it did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:26:47   | And so many of these great widget apps did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:26:50   | And we did an entire show about widget apps, which proves that they're not just for teenagers.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:26:54   | They're for, you know, serious automakers as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:26:57   | But, you know, it's great to see that that's happening. And I think that's why the change wallpaper thing has come back as well now.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:27:05   | You know, both that and the opening app trigger being pushed to the top of the list are related to all of this customisation because I've just realised I can have something change my wallpaper.                                                                        |
| 01:27:17   | At the moment, I use a plain black wallpaper and I use plain background on my widgets so that it just sort of blends in and you can't see where the widget ends and the wallpaper begins really aside from the word at the bottom widget pack in most cases.             |
| 01:27:29   | But I've just realised if I have a series of colour wallpapers which match the colour backgrounds available through widget pack, then I can have different colours at different times and I can also pull that colour in in widget pack and use that as my background colour. |
| 01:27:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:27:46   | Wow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:27:47   | Oh my gosh, I have so much automating to do, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:27:50   | Yeah, it's going to be great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:52   | And, you know, this whole thing still makes me so sad every time I look at my iPad with all those icons.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:27:57   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:27:58   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:27:59   | Come on, man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:28:00   | Well, if they're making this a priority, I really hope that we get the iPad full widget treatment in iOS 14 or iPadOS 14.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:28:10   | I feel like this could be a significant point update, just like they gave us mouse support as a point update last year.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:28:17   | I would really like to see them do that with these widgets, but I guess we'll find out.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:28:23   | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:28:24   | Well, I think that does it for today's show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:28:27   | Thank you, Rose, for kind of bringing us in on your home automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:28:31   | I know that was a lot, but I just wanted to hear what you were going to do because I knew you would take it to the next level and you did not let us down.                                                                                                               |
| 01:28:39   | I mean, I have to say that for most people, I've probably gone way too far with my home automation setup.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:28:44   | And that is the disadvantage of being a nerd who has a podcast about automation because you just go all in on this stuff.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:28:52   | But at the same time, it's been a huge amount of fun for me, and it means that I can probably try pretty much anything I like home automation wise now.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:00   | Because I think I have one of every different kind of home automation gadgets available in Europe, possibly.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:29:06   | I don't have a sleep detector yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:29:08   | I think if I lived alone, I think I would bring it to an unhealthy level.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:29:12   | So you're doing better than I would.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:29:15   | I think I think I've kept it at the point where things still generally work as expected and stuff does like stuff magically happens in a good way.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:29:23   | So I walk into the hallway and the light turns on there because there's a motion sensor, which means that it's light.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:28   | But when like 10 minutes later, it'll turn the light back off, which is great.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:29:32   | And same with opening the doors and things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:34   | So I'm going to add some more door sensors and so on. And I've got an outside storage cupboard, which I'm going to add a temperature sensor to to see, you know, like what the temperature and humidity levels are like out there in a door sensor.                      |
| 01:29:45   | So I know when the door opens and closes, but I think other than that, I'll be keeping things pretty, pretty stable.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:29:52   | Yeah, no, and it's fun to add things as you figure them out.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:29:56   | I've been playing with strip lights and some other stuff lately.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:30:00   | And I like the idea of mood lighting, which I'm also adding through home automation as the stuff is getting cheaper, more accessible.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:30:07   | And whether you use the home kit app or the Apple's home app, I guess you'd call it or home plus.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:30:14   | There's a lot you can do even without going the full Homebridge route.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:30:18   | So if you're listening, if you're in an apartment in your house, whatever, I hope that we've given you something you can use today.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:30:24   | Of course, we're all looking forward to these 14.3 changes, which can come soon enough for those of us not on the beta.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:30:31   | I'm just running the beta on one device now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:30:33   | So my life is a lot easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:30:35   | Yes. Yeah, that's one of those things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:30:38   | If everything runs through one system centrally, it is so much easier, which is why I want everything at home kit that I can manage.                                                                                                                                     |

| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automated. My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I am here to talk to                    |
| 00:06      | you about automating everything in your life with my co-host, David Sparks. Hey, David,                  |
| 00:11      | how are you today?                                                                                       |
| 00:12      | I am great, Rose, and this is an episode I've been looking forward to because we're automating           |
| 00:17      | Rosemary Orchard today.                                                                                  |
| 00:19      | Yeah. Yeah. Just when you thought that I couldn't be any more automated, I got a [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]]             |
| 00:23      | and the entire thing just went out the window.                                                     |
| 00:26      | Yeah. We both got [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedals]]. We're going to talk about that later in the episode,             |
| 00:29      | but the key today is we did an episode a few months ago where I walked through the main                  |
| 00:34      | automation stuff I'm doing, and I'm like, do you think we could do you, Rose? And you're                 |
| 00:39      | like, yeah. And I'm like, do you think we could do it within five hours? And you're                      |
| 00:42      | like, no promises. So here we are, right?                                                                |
| 00:46      | I mean, I didn't hear you say hours. I thought you said years.                                           |
| 00:49      | Okay. Well, there we go.                                                                                 |
| 00:51      | Yeah. We might have a bit to talk about today. It's okay. This is what show notes are for.               |
| 00:56      | We can come back to them next time.                                                                      |
| 00:57      | Yeah. But before we do that, we've got some exciting news. The Automators now has a membership           |
| 01:02      | program and it's got the best name. It's Automators Max. So if you're interested in signing up           |

| 01:59      | Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's purple in there. Yeah. We might have pulled some strings to                 |
| 02:04      | get some purple in there, but I'm very happy with the purple.                                            |
| 02:06      | All right. Well, that's a thing that will be going on, going forward. And we thank you                   |
| 02:12      | for your support. If you don't want to sign up for Automators Max, we're still giving                    |
| 02:15      | you a great show. I'm going to just keep doing it, but you know, Max is there for people                 |
| 02:19      | who want it. But we're here today to talk about Rose and how she does her automation                     |
| 02:25      | and the starting point as so often is document automation. I think that's something that                 |
| 02:32      | a lot of people struggle with. And I know you've put a lot of thought into it. So let's                  |
| 02:36      | talk.                                                                                                    |
| 02:37      | Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's where I started with document management is actually                |
| 02:43      | a pretty good place to talk about because where I started with document management was                   |
| 02:47      | a humongous downloads folder, which was quite frankly, almost embarrassing, and a really                 |
| 02:53      | badly organised documents folder and [[Dropbox]] and so on and so forth. And the way that I                  |
| 02:57      | fixed it was by automating it. So I essentially created automations for the file at the top              |
| 03:04      | of the stack and then ran the automations over those primarily using [[Hazel]] to get rid                    |
| 03:10      | of everything like that, which meant that every time I got rid of one kind of thing,                     |
| 03:15      | I was getting rid of all of the other kinds that fitted into that category. So for example,              |
| 03:20      | screenshots, I save screenshots to my downloads folder and they disappear after 24 hours unless          |
| 03:25      | I put them somewhere else. So if I want to keep them, I move them, but otherwise it lands                |
| 03:30      | in my downloads folder and then 24 hours later, it's gone. And that cleared out a whole bunch            |
| 03:36      | of things pretty quickly once I started chipping away at it because it meant that I was creating         |
| 03:42      | a rule. I had a whole bunch of really useful data to see whether or not things would fall                |
| 03:47      | into it because I was using Hazel's try feature where you can click on the eye and then you'll           |
| 03:53      | see whether or not a file falls into those rules or not and whether or not things will                   |
| 03:57      | be applied. And so that's where I really got started because the step one was clearing                   |
| 04:02      | out all of the rubbish because there is just so much stuff like ICS files. When you download             |
| 04:08      | an ICS file, you just want an event in your calendar. So what I do is I have [[Hazel]] immediately           |
| 04:13      | open the ICS file using Fantastical and then six hours later, it deletes it. If I've not                 |
| 04:18      | managed to click the add to calendar button in that time period, then I assume that I'm                  |
| 04:23      | not really that interested in the event and it will pop up an error when I eventually                    |
| 04:27      | try to click add and I can retrieve it because trash gets emptied after 24 hours. But it's               |
| 04:33      | one of those things where I tried to start with the really simple stuff, primarily the                   |
| 04:37      | downloads folder because that's where all the stuff ends up, of course. And it made a                    |
| 04:43      | big difference because it meant that I had suddenly piles of files that I could see and                  |
| 04:47      | go, right, well, this is the kind of thing that I need over here and I guess I want to                   |
| 04:50      | keep that sort of stuff, which is always a good place to get started.                                    |
| 04:55      | Yeah. I think that's a way a lot of people do it. And I think it's really wise to have                   |
| 05:01      | like a central place where automation points and then you can, I like the word shipping                  |
| 05:07      | in a way at it because I don't think this is something where you need to spend a weekend                 |
| 05:10      | writing a script for every type of file in there. You just kind of do it as you open                     |
| 05:15      | the folder and say, wow, what are you doing here? And how long have you been here? And                   |
| 05:21      | what can I do to make sure I don't have to see you ever again? And then you just make                    |
| 05:24      | a [[Hazel]] or a DEVONthink or whatever your system is, you make a rule to deal with that                 |
| 05:30      | category. And it's fun because then after a while it really becomes like, you know,                      |
| 05:36      | when you start out the process, there may be a hundred or a thousand files in that folder.               |
| 05:40      | But then after you do it a while, you're like, oh, there's three files in here. It's like                |
| 05:44      | you're personally offended. How did these three files get through all my rules? You                      |
| 05:48      | know, how did they slip through the cracks? So something you start coming up with things                 |
| 05:51      | and before you know it, you've got a very thorough system.                                               |
| 05:55      | Now, I like that you're doing it in a download floor because I do that in the action folder              |
| 05:59      | and it's just a folder I created called action that I point all the rules at. But it's not               |
| 06:04      | a bad idea to just put it in downloads because like you said, stuff goes there naturally                 |
| 06:08      | anyway. I don't know if that makes more sense or less sense than the action versus like                  |
| 06:15      | downloads. The nice thing about the action is you deliberately put it there. But that's                  |
| 06:20      | an extra step too, you know? Yeah, I mean, I have two, I have both. So I actually have                   |
| 06:25      | a folder. I mean, I've got three because I've got one in iCloud. I've got a folder in [[Dropbox]]            |
| 06:31      | called automated actions. And then I've got my downloads folder. And downloads is really                 |
| 06:35      | where a whole chunk of stuff happens because things do just end up there. And I've done                  |
| 06:38      | things like change my default screenshot safe location to downloads explicitly because                   |
| 06:43      | I really don't want to keep screenshots for very long. I actually use clean shots to take                |
| 06:47      | my screenshots most of the time. It automatically puts them on my clipboard. I paste them wherever       |
| 06:52      | it needs to go and I close and then it never actually gets saved, which is kind of part                  |
| 06:58      | of the magic of managing documents. If you can avoid having documents, you don't need                    |
| 07:01      | to manage them. But I do have specific automated actions folders inside of iCloud and [[Dropbox]]            |
| 07:10      | because this means that other things can put files and things there to be managed. So for                |
| 07:16      | example, Zapier will save certain things into subfolders of the automated actions folder                  |
| 07:21      | in [[Dropbox]] for me and [[Make]] previously known as [[Make\|Integromat]] does that as well. And then                    |
| 07:26      | I have shortcuts, of course, and that saves things. Historically, always save things inside              |
| 07:31      | the shortcuts folder. And so that was where my automated actions folder was in iCloud.                   |
| 07:36      | And I've been able, fortunately, with iOS 15 to move that up a level to the top in iCloud,               |
| 07:42      | which means that I can have magic happen in those places. And I try to keep those folders                |
| 07:50      | fairly single purpose, if that makes sense. So I have inside of automated actions, a folder              |
| 07:55      | called add to DEVONthink, which, funnily enough, adds everything that gets put in there               |
| 08:00      | into DEVONthink, and then that's it. Just because I don't, I want it to be very, very                 |
| 08:06      | obvious when I'm trying to create an automation or doing something on say a phone, which is              |
| 08:10      | not so easy to see document management on, or massive file paths, that that's where that                 |
| 08:17      | thing is going. Because the last thing you want is to say, hey, put all of the files                     |
| 08:23      | that I actually wanted to just keep for like 24 hours, just in case, and then get rid of                 |
| 08:27      | into DEVONthink, because when I put something in DEVONthink it's staying there, not because        |
| 08:31      | it's difficult to delete things. But that's just because I like, if something's going                    |
| 08:35      | into DEVONthink for me, that means that it is something that is a relatively permanent                |
| 08:39      | archive. You know, I say relatively, because there's always exceptions to the rule. I'm                  |
| 08:44      | sure when my washing machine breaks, I will delete my washing machine manual. But also,                  |
| 08:49      | you know, that that's one of my solutions. You know, if something is a archive document,                 |
| 08:53      | you know, I need to keep this, I need to keep this for a long time. It's going in DEVONthink.                |
| 08:57      | But will you, you know, sometimes you'll                                                          |
| 08:59      | look in there and you will find a washing machine manual from 20 years ago. Like, maybe                  |
| 09:03      | you're not old enough yet, but you'll be surprised how much digital detritus you get.                    |
| 09:07      | I mean, I got my first washing machine manual when I bought, where I currently live two                  |
| 09:12      | years ago. The washing machine I'm pleased to note is 12 years old now. And I was able                   |
| 09:16      | to get the manual online. I did some pretty deep Googling to find it, but it was one of                  |
| 09:21      | those things where actually finding that manual was really good because my washing machine               |
| 09:25      | was making really weird noise the other day. Like it turned out that the drum was just                   |
| 09:30      | like imbalanced. But I was able to search washing machine manual and found all my machine                |
| 09:39      | and I actually found it. I actually didn't even do that. I opened up my phone because                    |
| 09:42      | it was in the kitchen and I was hearing the noise and okay, searching washing machine                    |
| 09:46      | manual. Okay. Noises. Drum is unbalanced. Do this. I'm looking at it going, I have                       |
| 09:51      | no idea how a washing machine works, but this thing is 12 years old. It's pretty mechanical.             |
| 09:55      | If it goes wrong, I have to buy a new one anyway. So I'll give it a try and it worked.                   |
| 10:00      | And I was very pleased that I was able to find that so quickly and it was only because                   |
| 10:04      | I've set things up and I just, you know, I just named it washing machine manual. It's                    |
| 10:08      | okay. Like it doesn't need an amazing name in that case, but it is pretty helpful to                     |
| 10:12      | just have all of that kind of thing at your fingertips when you need it, but also be able                |
| 10:18      | to just completely not only ignore that group of documents 99% of the time, because most                 |
| 10:23      | of the time I don't care how my mixer works or my washing machine or things like that.                   |
| 10:28      | And I don't care about last year's text return, but I do care that if I get audited, I have              |
| 10:33      | lost your text return and if my washing machine goes wrong, I have the manual. So it makes               |
| 10:38      | sense to be able to keep that information.                                                               |
| 10:40      | Yeah. A point you made there that I'd like to emphasise is the naming of it washing machine              |
| 10:46      | manual. I know that sounds dumb, but think about future you and what terms would you                     |
| 10:51      | search on? And I get that these apps are very powerful and they do OCR and even if you give              |
| 10:58      | it a really obscure name and you type washing machine, it's still probably going to find                 |
| 11:01      | it, but why not make it easy? And you know, you don't need to go crazy. You don't need                   |
| 11:08      | to even put the name and the brand and everything in the name. But if you just put in the word           |
| 11:11      | washing machine, you're making it much easier for your future self to find it.                           |
| 11:16      | Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And that's one of the things I really do try to work on when it                    |
| 11:22      | comes to document management is good names. So many things land in, you know, whatever                   |
| 11:27      | folder it comes into. It comes in as an email attachment or whatever. And somebody's just                |
| 11:31      | given it a really bad name, untitled 179 or something. The first thing I try to do whenever              |
| 11:39      | I'm creating something actually is give it a name. It could be a working title, but I                    |
| 11:44      | try to give it a name immediately because that means that when I'm inevitably looking                    |
| 11:48      | for the thing again later, you know, I find it and that is, you know, that's more of a                   |
| 11:53      | life hack than an automation hack. But it also means once I've given it the name, then the               |
| 11:58      | automations can put it away in the right place. Though I should note that on my working directories,     |
| 12:04      | the places where I keep files that I'm actively working on, I tend not to have automations               |
| 12:10      | running specifically unless I tag something. So [[Hazel]] will watch my documents folder, but                |
| 12:17      | it's only watching for things with the tag done because that way that gets picked up.                    |
| 12:23      | But until I finish working on it, it's not going to, it's not going to find it. I should                 |
| 12:27      | create a smart folder. I actually think about it now for all the things that I've not touched            |
| 12:31      | in like 48 hours, which don't have the done tag, just so that I can find those.                          |
| 12:37      | The way I solve that problem, because that is an issue, right? The flip side of this                     |
| 12:42      | document automation is if you get really good at it, the documents disappear before you                  |
| 12:47      | do anything with them. And I actually had that happen to me once where it put like,                      |
| 12:51      | I think it was a water bill. It like filed it for me before I paid it. And I just didn't                 |
| 12:56      | realise I hadn't paid it. And they sent me a letter, Hey, dude, you haven't paid your                    |
| 12:59      | bill. And I'm like, Oh, I never saw it because [[Hazel]] took care of it before I read it.                   |
| 13:05      | And so what I do, this is kind of a, this is not a very automated, technical way to                      |
| 13:13      | handle it. But so I have the action folder and inside that folder, I have three subfolders,              |
| 13:19      | one for MacSparky, one for legal, which is hopefully going away soon, and then one                      |
| 13:23      | for personal. And anything, and I point all the [[Hazel]] rules actually at those subfolders.                |
| 13:29      | And that allows me to kind of like parse the [[Hazel]] rules based on what part of my life                   |
| 13:34      | they're working on. So that makes it easier to manage them. But the actual action folder                 |
| 13:39      | doesn't have any rules pointed at it. And that's the one, actually, I take that back.                    |
| 13:45      | Let me, I'll explain, but the action folder, the only thing the action folder rules do                   |
| 13:49      | are automatically move things into folders if they're the kinds of things that can be                    |
| 13:54      | automatically moved. But otherwise, I look through them, and then I decide, okay, this                   |
| 13:58      | one is going to something I need to pay, I need to make a note or whatever. And then                     |
| 14:02      | I can put it into the, the personal folder and it'll get filed.                                          |
| 14:06      | Yeah. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Yes. What I am trying to do with a lot of this,                   |
| 14:11      | I'm not there yet. And this is a system that until I trust it 100%, I'm not going to change              |
| 14:16      | things. What I'm, I'm aiming for is create OmniFocus actions automatically from things                   |
| 14:22      | like that. So that then it should appear wherever, you know, it should appear where I'm going            |
| 14:28      | to look for the task itself. But it's not actually going to change. But I don't need                     |
| 14:33      | to, you know, manually put the thing somewhere so that it gets handled because that of course            |
| 14:39      | is where I will fail to do something at some point and then accidentally have a backlog                  |
| 14:43      | of four water bills that need to managing. I actually created an OmniFocus [[AppleScript]]                  |
| 14:48      | to do that a few years ago where I could flag it and have it create an OmniFocus task. But               |
| 14:54      | the script broke after a certain amount of time. And just like, if it's not 100% reliable,               |
| 14:58      | that is a very dangerous game, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, my plan with this, the                      |
| 15:04      | way that I'm trying to structure this is I'm actually doing this with [[Keyboard Maestro]]                   |
| 15:09      | adding the OmniFocus action. Because if something goes wrong, then I just have, you know, I              |
| 15:14      | just tell [[Keyboard Maestro]], stop, like, don't, don't do the rest of the macro, just stop                 |
| 15:18      | right there. Because that means that if there's a file there, it means that something didn't             |
| 15:23      | work somewhere. And then I can go into debug. But at the minimum, then I've got the, yeah,               |
| 15:27      | well, the file's still here. So you need to do whatever the right action is for it. And                  |
| 15:31      | you need to look it up in your system is whatever the right action is, if you don't remember.            |
| 15:35      | Because yes, with something like that, you do have to trust it 100%. And it's very useful                |
| 15:42      | to be able to do that. But also to have a system that, you know, until I trust it 100%, I'm              |
| 15:47      | able to scope. Yeah, I'm going to stop because I ran into an error.                                      |
| 15:51      | Yeah, makes sense. Now, where does [[DEVONthink]] fit in this? Because you've mentioned Devon               |
| 15:55      | think and [[Hazel]].                                                                                         |
| 15:57      | Yes. So I do use both. And I should know [[DEVONthink]] is sponsoring the show. But even if                 |
| 16:02      | they weren't sponsoring the show, I would still have to talk about it because I really                   |
| 16:06      | love and use the application on a regular basis. And a lot of what I do with [[DEVONthink]]                 |
| 16:10      | is essentially just like organise these documents, you know, I've got a business, so I've got            |
| 16:15      | all of the invoices and receipts and everything that I need to keep. And so all of those end             |
| 16:20      | up in [[DEVONthink]]. And what I am doing in [[DEVONthink]] for those is I'm using the smart                   |
| 16:25      | rules to organise and rename things and put information into custom metadata fields. I                   |
| 16:32      | can't believe I lived so long with [[DEVONthink]] without really using custom metadata fields,              |
| 16:37      | but they've allowed me to create, you know, like this was the cost of this and this was                  |
| 16:41      | the VAT paid on it, fields, which means that then essentially I pretty much have an automated            |
| 16:49      | texture turn, which is really great combined with some smart dates and so on. And that is                |
| 16:55      | incredibly useful. And even more so when my accountant somehow lost all of the digital                   |
| 17:02      | documents that I had sent over. And so I sent everything again, and it was, you know, five               |
| 17:07      | minutes of work to export everything and just say, yep, it's all here, go. Because, you                  |
| 17:14      | know, I had everything in a really easy to organise format, which means that also I'm                    |
| 17:19      | actually maintaining all of the stuff, which is something that I'm sure people who've got                |
| 17:25      | their own business and have to do texture turns or maybe just Americans because you                      |
| 17:27      | all have to do texture turns over there are aware can be a bit of a pain at times keeping                |
| 17:34      | track of all those receipts and everything. It makes it incredibly easy. And my favourite                 |
| 17:38      | thing that I've been working on recently is getting emails automatically out of mail                     |
| 17:43      | into [[DEVONthink]] and converting them into a PDF. So all of my Apple receipts get pushed                  |
| 17:49      | into [[DEVONthink]] and converted into PDFs with all this data on them, because that's                      |
| 17:54      | one of the things that I need. Okay, well, it makes sense. So, you know, you've got some                 |
| 17:59      | stuff in [[Hazel]], you get some stuff in Devon thing. Interestingly, you know, [[DEVONthink]]                  |
| 18:03      | does have a really powerful set of [[Hazel]] like rules inside of it. So you could do it all                 |
| 18:09      | with either. Yeah, yeah, you could. I just tend to use [[DEVONthink]] for these are documents               |
| 18:14      | that I want to be able to access anywhere. potentially, you know, I probably won't,                      |
| 18:20      | but I want to be able to. And also, I really need to keep these documents, you know, they're             |
| 18:27      | documents that they're not something that I will work on, necessarily. They're more                      |
| 18:33      | reference materials. And when I'm done with things, then I'll put them in there as well                  |
| 18:38      | if it's something that I've created that I'm proud of. I want to keep or something that                  |
| 18:43      | I just want to look back to frequently for inspiration. But a lot of it is essentially,                  |
| 18:48      | you know, manuals and receipts and things like that. But it is really handy to use that                  |
| 18:54      | to just organise that information because then, right, I'm looking for the thing that tells              |
| 18:59      | me how to reset my door lock because I have a smart door lock. Okay, well, that it's going               |
| 19:04      | to be in [[DEVONthink]], yeah, and I'll just search for lock or door or Yale. And it will                   |
| 19:11      | appear because not only have I given it, you know, a good file name, which is I've got                   |
| 19:16      | two different ones. So they both start with Yale door lock, they do have the model in                    |
| 19:20      | there and then I've added a bunch of information in, in the metadata because that's something            |
| 19:26      | that you can do where you, you know, add extra information. There's aliases as well that                 |
| 19:33      | you can use. I tend just to end up writing in the, I think it's a custom metadata field                  |
| 19:40      | that I created called notes. But it's a very handy place to just add extra information and               |
| 19:47      | you can do the same thing in Finder. But, you know, it's, for me, somehow [[DEVONthink]]                    |
| 19:54      | works really well for my brain. And also the fact that it doesn't matter what device I'm                 |
| 19:59      | on, I can just open my [[DEVONthink]] database and then find everything is in here, except                  |
| 20:05      | at work, of course, I do have a separate [[DEVONthink]] database for work related things.                   |
| 20:09      | Yeah, I mean, custom metadata is so much easier with [[DEVONthink]] than Finder. It's like not              |
| 20:13      | even close. Like I made a custom field for [[Obsidian]] link. So if I have a related note                    |
| 20:20      | on any file in [[DEVONthink]], I've got a custom metadata for that link, you know, nice. One                |
| 20:26      | thing that you do with [[DEVONthink]] is you create links to documents, which I would imagine               |
| 20:31      | is it's helpful for your tax planning. That is more difficult with Finder based files.                   |
| 20:37      | And you do have some stuff you can find or do you have a system for that? Like how do                    |
| 20:41      | you how do you link to a document and find her? I guess is the question. I tend not to,                  |
| 20:45      | to be honest. You know, if I'm going to link to a file, it's either going to be something                |
| 20:49      | that is in [[DEVONthink]] or [[Obsidian]]. And I mean, I could put all of my markdown files                     |
| 20:57      | and everything into [[Obsidian]]. I actually have it index that folder so that if I am searching             |
| 21:02      | for something and I've, it turns out that what it is is I've stored it in a link in                      |
| 21:07      | as part of an [[Obsidian]] document, I'll still find it. But pretty much if I'm going to link                |
| 21:12      | to something, it's going to be in [[DEVONthink]] or [[Obsidian]]. And the files that live on my                 |
| 21:18      | device tend not to be things that I, I link to in that sort of way. The closest that I                   |
| 21:24      | might come is, you know, there's, there's a path to a folder here because that folder                    |
| 21:29      | contains a project that I'm working on, you know, on development wise. So, you know, I'm                 |
| 21:34      | only to open it with [[Xcode]] or Web Store or more Nova or BS code or something, depending                  |
| 21:40      | on what it is.                                                                                           |
| 21:41      | All right. But you've opened another can of worms. You're putting documents in [[Obsidian]]                  |
| 21:45      | as well.                                                                                                 |
| 21:46      | Well, I say documents, they're just markdown documents or images that I'm referencing and                |
| 21:51      | markdown documents so that I've got an image there. I tend not to put other kinds of files               |
| 21:57      | in there. There's no particular reason, but if I'm going to reference a file, then it's                  |
| 22:04      | probably going to be something that's on the internet or a document that I'm going to be                 |
| 22:09      | putting in [[DEVONthink]] so that I can have a link to that.                                                |
| 22:14      | Yeah. I'm, I'm the same way. I feel like [[DEVONthink]] is way better at documents than                     |
| 22:20      | [[Obsidian]] is. So I don't put any real documents in [[Obsidian]]. Okay. I know this whole thing                |
| 22:26      | sounded like a [[DEVONthink]] ad, but we're both big [[DEVONthink]] fans. So sorry. It's just                  |
| 22:29      | weird that they're also sponsoring today, but there you go.                                              |
| 22:32      | It is weird, but it's just one of those things. Yeah. There is one tiny thing. Well, maybe               |
| 22:38      | not tiny thing that I will mention that's sort of related to document management, which                  |
| 22:44      | is I've got a lot of config files, which I am slowly putting into [[Git]]. So for anybody                    |
| 22:51      | who uses the terminal on a regular basis, you probably have a bash or a ZSH config. If                   |
| 22:57      | you use [[Git]], then you'll have a [[Git]] config. If you use item, then you might have custom                  |
| 23:02      | settings like I've got badges for different folders and item and I'm slowly putting all                  |
| 23:06      | of those and my Homebrew installs into a [[Git]] repo. And this has been causing all sorts                   |
| 23:14      | of wonderful headaches because I realised I actually have zero consistency in the way                    |
| 23:18      | that my machines are set up, which explains why every so often I'll be on one machine                    |
| 23:22      | going, but I'm sure this worked when I did this yesterday. And the answer is it was on                   |
| 23:26      | the other machine. So I'm trying to unify across my devices that so that I end up with                   |
| 23:32      | the same setup everywhere just because you go to search for a document, being able to                    |
| 23:36      | find it on every device is great. But if you go to do something, especially when it's                    |
| 23:42      | code related, I find, and you're missing the application that you need to do it or something,            |
| 23:48      | it's very frustrating. So I'm managing those files by putting them in [[Git]].                               |

| 25:10      | So, David, do you want to talk about setups and breakdowns and all of that fun?                          |
| 25:16      | Rose, you're speaking my language. I just love that so much.                                             |
| 25:20      | Yes, yes.                                                                                                |
| 25:21      | I love setup automation. Yeah, context switching. I mean, it's like, come on. What are you               |
| 25:26      | doing to me here?                                                                                        |
| 25:27      | I know, I know, I know. I'm just saying the magic words.                                                 |
| 25:30      | Share your secrets, Rose. Share your secrets.                                                            |
| 25:32      | Well, my secrets aren't exactly difficult, fortunately. And essentially what I have done                 |
| 25:42      | is I've, I spent a bit of time sitting down and going, okay, what do I actually need to                  |
| 25:48      | do in different places? Because that, for me, was a lot of the work because it turns                     |
| 25:54      | out that if you record three podcasts, there's a bunch of common things that happen across               |
| 26:00      | all three podcasts. And so, it's probably sensible to have that unified so that when                     |
| 26:08      | you start recording a podcast, the things that happen for every podcast always happen.                   |
| 26:13      | And then podcast specific things happen. So, for example, when I start recording automators              |
| 26:18      | or when I say that I'm going to be recording an episode of automators, Kibble My Show goes,              |
| 26:22      | which episode is this? And amazing, wonderful, love it, type it in. And then at the end of               |
| 26:29      | the show, it helps me rename files using the episode number because it stores it. And so,                |
| 26:36      | what I've done for this is I've got Bunch, which is what I'm using for the big overview                  |
| 26:43      | of it. And that is running a number of things, including shortcuts, and of course, keyboard              |
| 26:50      | master macros and opening and closing applications. And then once all the applications are open,         |
| 26:56      | it runs [[Moom]]. So, it can tidy everything up for me, which is really nice so that then                    |
| 27:01      | when I start recording an episode, that [[Safari]] is right in front of me with the tabs that                |
| 27:05      | I need because it's created a new [[Safari]] window and put everything into those tabs. And all              |
| 27:11      | the other windows that I need are in the places that they always are so that I'm not usually             |
| 27:15      | going, wait, where did I put [[Audio Hijack]] again? It's hiding somewhere. Yeah, I do the                   |
| 27:21      | same thing. It's funny how we've harnessed [[Moom]] to turn into a minion of our automation.                 |
| 27:29      | And it's not that hard because you can set a keyboard shortcut to any layout and then                    |
| 27:32      | you just trigger a keyboard shortcut in it and you're good to go. Yes, yes, exactly.                     |
| 27:38      | Did you know [[BetterTouchTool]] has an action and shortcuts to trigger a keyboard shortcut?               |
| 27:45      | That's like, that is like gold.                                                                          |
| 27:48      | That is a really handy tool. Yes, because there are so many things that you need to do                   |
| 27:55      | a keyboard shortcut in or the easiest way to automate it is just do the keyboard shortcut                |
| 28:00      | inside it. Yeah.                                                                                         |
| 28:02      | You know, one of the things I'm doing right now, which happened at the start of this episode             |
| 28:06      | is I ran a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros to start recording, to actually start the recording                   |
| 28:10      | of the episode. And that saved a time stamping [[Keyboard Maestro]]. And it also switched [[Audio Hijack]]             |
| 28:16      | and then did the keyboard shortcut to start the recording, which is Command R.                    |
| 28:22      | And you know, there's a new version of [[Audio Hijack]] coming with scripting and I can't wait               |
| 28:25      | for that. But for the time being, doing the recording or just starting the recording                     |
| 28:32      | through keyboard shortcut, that's pretty powerful. But I wouldn't be able to do that in shortcuts        |
| 28:36      | if it wasn't for [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                      |
| 28:38      | Yeah, yeah, it's awesome. I mean, it's like, we had Apple on Mac power users and I was                   |
| 28:43      | asking them about like, triggering menu items and keyboard shortcuts. That stuff is such                 |
| 28:49      | an easy way to, to kind of like hack your way into automation. And they're like, no,                     |
| 28:56      | it's not like they just were not interested in doing that. Now [[BetterTouchTool\|BetterTouchTool's]] added                  |
| 28:59      | the whole tool set. I mean, menu items, it just, it's like a killer app now for shortcuts,               |
| 29:05      | which makes me laugh. But anyway, I went down a little bit of a tangent there for a second.              |
| 29:12      | So it's, it's a combination of Bunch and [[Moom]] sounds like to really get it going. What,                  |
| 29:17      | what are some of the other like setups that you have? Like when you want to code for work                |
| 29:22      | or, I don't know, just tell, tell me some of the other setups you've got.                                |
| 29:26      | Well, I mean, it depends because actually at work, I have three primary setups that                      |
| 29:31      | I use. I've got coding, which, you know, splits my ID, which PHP storm on one side of my screen,         |
| 29:37      | Firefox on the other side of my screen. And then on my laptop screen, it'll put item split               |
| 29:42      | into three areas. So running the right commands that I need for, for the day. But then if                |
| 29:48      | I'm going joining a meeting at work, then it will put teams in the middle because it's,                  |
| 29:54      | it's going to be teams for meetings, meetings. And it puts, it slims down Firefox and puts               |
| 30:01      | it on the left of that and it slims down PHP storm and puts it on the right just so that                 |
| 30:06      | if I need to see my code or the, the site that I was on beforehand, I can do that.                       |
| 30:12      | And then I've also got another one for, I'm screen sharing, because when I'm screen sharing              |
| 30:17      | with people, I have a 32 inch ultra wide monitor. It's amazing. If you need to share your entire         |
| 30:23      | screen, the other person needs a magnifying glass, unfortunately. And also, you know,                    |
| 30:30      | I like to get rid of other applications that I might have had running, you know, I might                 |
| 30:33      | have had [[Safari]] open just to, you know, Google something that I was thinking about, you know,            |
| 30:38      | buying perhaps or something, you know, when you think of something, you just do it because               |
| 30:41      | it takes three seconds and then you've got [[Safari]] open still. And so it helps clean up                   |
| 30:46      | things like that as well, just because I don't want messages sending me a notification while             |
| 30:50      | I'm, you know, on a slack huddle with somebody sharing my screen, it's not important. So,                |
| 30:56      | so I do that. And it actually switches my focus mode from work to work meeting. I just                   |
| 31:03      | have a work meeting focus mode, which gets rid of even more notifications than just my                   |
| 31:10      | regular work focus mode. And then when I end that, then the switch is back to my work focus              |
| 31:14      | mode, which is really handy. And I'm switching focus modes, because people are going to ask              |
| 31:20      | about this, I'm switching focus modes using shortcuts. And what I do, and how I run the                  |
| 31:25      | shortcut is because I switch mode through bunch, I just have it run the Apple Scout                      |
| 31:31      | switches, tell application shortcuts to run shortcut, quote, the name of your shortcut.                  |
| 31:36      | And you do need quotation marks around the name of your shortcut if it's got a space in                  |
| 31:40      | it. But it's, it's very easy to do. And there's a number of ways that I can do this. I usually           |
| 31:46      | trigger bunch primarily from my [[Stream Deck]], because I have the icons there. And I had                   |
| 31:54      | an idea. I only started this the other day, unfortunately, because TJ Lewin created the                  |
| 32:00      | great calendar icon, which you can have in [[Stream Deck]]. And that's controlled through                    |
| 32:07      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] and you change the background colour of the [[Keyboard Maestro]], the stream                 |
| 32:13      | deck button, and you change what text is on it all through [[Keyboard Maestro]] and some                     |
| 32:17      | AppleScript and bash scripts and everything. It's, it's genuinely amazing. And I love it.               |
| 32:22      | I realised what I can probably do a good chunk of the time is read some of that same data                |
| 32:30      | and actually use it to display the right bunch. So then when I press one [[Stream Deck]] button,             |
| 32:36      | it will almost certainly run exactly the right bunch for exactly what I'm doing. And then                |
| 32:41      | I'll have another one next to it for just like, you know, give me all the bunches. And                   |
| 32:44      | I can choose whichever one manually. But I realise, you know, when I'm, when it's Wednesday,             |
| 32:50      | I'm recording automators. When it's Tuesday, I'm recording iOS today. When it's Thursday,                |
| 32:53      | I'm recording nested folders. Guess what? I can put one button. So I don't need three                    |
| 32:57      | buttons taken up the entire time. I don't need to hide them behind a podcasting button.                  |
| 33:01      | I just need to, you know, have one button, which shows me the correct thing. So that's                   |
| 33:05      | what I am playing with at the moment. I don't think that's going to be ready by the time                 |
| 33:09      | this show ships, but hopefully I will have it in a vaguely shareable state so I can talk                 |
| 33:15      | about it in the forums.                                                                                  |
| 33:16      | Yeah, that's a lot. You know, I'm a big fan. [[Brett Terpstra\|Brett]] and I wrote books together. I just                    |
| 33:23      | haven't really got fully invested in bunch it. And I think the reason is because I set                   |
| 33:29      | up all of these scripts in [[Keyboard Maestro]] to do setups for me. And like the kind of                    |
| 33:34      | stuff I want to do, usually with a setup is open apps and then arrange them using moon,                  |
| 33:40      | which is the same thing you're doing with bunch. And occasionally like I'll start a                      |
| 33:45      | timer or something, but all that stuff is scriptable inside [[Keyboard Maestro]]. I'm trying                 |
| 33:51      | to make the case for me for [[Bunch]]. I mean, what should I, what am I missing here?                        |
| 33:55      | Well, one of the great things that you can do with bunch, which I think a lot of people                  |
| 33:59      | probably will like is if you click on the bunch option in the menu bar, there is an                      |
| 34:03      | option right there, new bunch with open apps, which means that you can just open up the                  |
| 34:10      | apps that you usually want to have for this thing and you can save it. And this is the                   |
| 34:15      | same trick is you can, you can do the same trick with moon. You can save a window layout                 |
| 34:20      | snapshot once you've positioned or your windows where you want them. And for me, that was                |
| 34:26      | really helpful getting started because I had some of this stuff in [[Keyboard Maestro]], but                 |
| 34:30      | I'd never really bothered to sit down and figure it out. And another feature that I                      |
| 34:37      | really like, and this is not to say that [[Keyboard Maestro]] is not great for this, is I really             |
| 34:42      | like the fact that when I open a bunch file, it's pretty much just a list of application                 |
| 34:46      | names. So I'm skimming it and I'm going, yep, visual studio code. Yeah, that's the one                   |
| 34:52      | that I want, you know, and it's, it's great for both when you're having those brain fart                 |
| 34:55      | moments where I don't remember what the name of the thing is that I need to open because                 |
| 35:00      | everybody's brain does that every once in a while. And it's also just very useful for                    |
| 35:06      | being able to copy little chunks very easily and reorder them. Whereas an action in keyboard             |
| 35:13      | maestro, and it's the same if you, you have an action in shortcuts, it just takes up a                   |
| 35:16      | lot more space on your screen than a single line of code, which, which is really helpful.                |
| 35:23      | What I also like about bunch is each bunch can have the concept of being open or closed                  |
| 35:29      | or running and not running, which means that I can toggle it on and off. And so I can say                |
| 35:34      | when I start my recording, podcast recording, automators bunch, do these things. And when                |
| 35:41      | I finish it, do those things. And I don't need to try and harness like which mode I'm                    |
| 35:49      | in, because I could theoretically be in multiple modes simultaneously, because bunch supports            |
| 35:54      | that. And that's one of the reasons why I really like it. I think it's probably a good                   |
| 35:59      | chunk of it is that, that concept of a bunch being on or off, essentially, that allows                   |
| 36:05      | me to add extra magic.                                                                                   |
| 36:08      | I think I need to like really just like say for the next month, I'm just going to use                    |
| 36:12      | bunch for this. Like one of the reasons I wanted to kind of keep it with [[Keyboard Maestro]]                |
| 36:16      | is that, you know, I've already got it all, all the triggers and buttons connected, you                  |
| 36:21      | know, and like putting up the infrastructure to, to switch over is a pain. The other thing               |
| 36:27      | was I was really toying with the ability to try and set windows size and height and everything           |
| 36:34      | in, in [[Keyboard Maestro]] to take [[Moom]] out of the loop, you know, that way it's easier                     |
| 36:39      | if you have one less app involved. But I just found that like you really have to do a pixel              |
| 36:45      | by pixel and [[Keyboard Maestro]] to do this right. And then like if I change resolution, everything         |
| 36:51      | just looks terrible. And it's just like it really just wasn't kind of doing the job.                     |
| 36:56      | Yeah, yeah, I have to say, you know, I do, you know, Keyboard Maestro's window management                |
| 37:01      | generally is great because you can do things like just move this to the centre of my primary             |
| 37:06      | monitor, which is actually something that I've got hooked onto several other actions.                    |
| 37:13      | So for example, if I try to quit [[Safari]] with command Q, most of the time I did not mean                  |
| 37:19      | to hit command Q, I meant hit command W to close tab. So I actually have [[Keyboard Maestro]]                |
| 37:24      | interfere with it there and go, are you sure? Like, did you actually want to do this? And                |
| 37:29      | one of the things that it does with the are you sure is it moves that right into the middle              |
| 37:33      | of my main monitor. Because that means that I'm actually going to see it because there's                 |
| 37:37      | nothing worse than deliberately trying to do something and getting an are you sure prompt                |
| 37:41      | that's wait, wait, why is it way over there in the right hand corner of my secondary monitor?            |
| 37:46      | That's not where I wanted to see it. And the answer is I dragged it, I dragged the keyboard              |
| 37:50      | maestro prompt there sometime previously, and [[Keyboard Maestro]] smarter remembers where                   |
| 37:54      | you put the prompt because you probably want to put it back, except for this thing I don't.              |
| 37:59      | I always want it front and centre. So I have it move things in that respect. And where are               |
| 38:04      | you doing something relative to other things? So smack bang in the centre vertically and                 |
| 38:09      | horizontally of my main monitor, it's fabulous, but it is much trickier to say, yeah, I want             |
| 38:15      | this to take up one third of my screen vertically, please. Or, you know, one, one third of my            |
| 38:22      | screen horizontally actually is what I mean. So I end up with three columns on my screen.                |
| 38:25      | The smart home fit into this at all. Yes. So of course, when I'm podcasting, I have                      |
| 38:32      | automated curtains and automated blinds and things like that. And the last thing I want                  |
| 38:35      | is mid recording for my blinds start going down and going, or my current start closing                   |
| 38:41      | and going, and I won't do that sound for very long because it is quite annoying. And it                  |
| 38:47      | probably doesn't get picked up much by my microphone or it shouldn't do. I've done my                    |
| 38:52      | best to position everything so that it wouldn't. But one of the things that I do when I start            |
| 38:57      | my recording is I actually have it trigger my podcast recording focus mode and then my                   |
| 39:03      | phone checks, hey, is sunset in the next two hours? Okay, cool. I'm just going to go ahead               |
| 39:08      | and close your curtains and blinds right now, at least in my office. And that is really                  |
| 39:14      | helpful. And of course, it also turns on lights and so on as part of that. And I have a variety          |
| 39:18      | of home kit scenes set up for like Iowa's today, where I use different colour lights                      |
| 39:24      | in the background and things like that. And I've been getting pretty nerdy with the home                 |
| 39:28      | automation stuff, David. I think there's going to be quite a bit to talk about there.                    |

| 40:44      | feel like your home automation has started over. It's like a very much fast moving train.                |
| 40:51      | Where are you right now with respect to home automation?                                                 |
| 40:54      | There is a lot of home automation in my life, David. I've taken the opportunity because                  |
| 41:01      | I've been using the IKEA smart home stuff. I've got quite a bit of it. I've got smart                    |
| 41:06      | blinds that I've got quite a few of the smart outlets. I've got some bulbs. I recently got               |
| 41:10      | a nice new uplighter in my living room. IKEA has GU10 white comfort bulbs. That was what                 |
| 41:20      | I needed for the reading light in there. I just got two IKEA smart bulbs. Unfortunately,                 |
| 41:26      | I think that a chunk of this is due to the fact that I have a lot of smart home stuff.                   |
| 41:31      | I have a lot of devices. Apparently, my home was built with the very best of insulation                  |
| 41:39      | in mind. One of the ways that they did that was by foil backed plasterboard and a number                 |
| 41:45      | of other things which massively interfere with the signal inside of my home. I kid you                   |
| 41:51      | not when I say that I have one of what feels like the UK's tiniest flats. It's two bedrooms              |
| 41:58      | just if you are very, very, very good friends with everybody. But I can be in one room and               |
| 42:06      | I will not have Wi-Fi signal even though the router is literally in the next room. That                  |
| 42:10      | massively interferes with things. The IKEA hub, unfortunately, really, really, really                    |
| 42:15      | struggled for me. I've ended up moving all of my IKEA things into home assistant because                 |
| 42:21      | home assistant, you can plug a Zigbee dongle into it. I bought a Zigbee dongle and I paired              |
| 42:28      | everything with home assistant. Home assistant and the Zigbee dongle that I bought seem                  |
| 42:32      | to be doing a really, really great job of getting all of my things to talk to each other.                |
| 42:39      | I can share those back into [[HomeKit]] so I'm not losing out on the fact that I can then                    |
| 42:43      | talk to a home pot and say open and close this blind and do these things and so on and                   |
| 42:46      | so forth. But also, home assistant automations are a lot more powerful. You can say, for                 |
| 42:54      | example, if this door is open for two minutes, then do this thing, which is something that               |
| 43:00      | I was trying to do for a long time in [[HomeKit]] and Shortcuts and I had things forming out                 |
| 43:08      | to my push cut automation server where it was checking every 10 seconds, hey, is the                     |
| 43:13      | door still open? Is the door still open? Is the door still open? Well, there's 120 seconds               |
| 43:18      | in two minutes. That's 12 runs of a shortcut to check whether or not a door is still open.               |
| 43:26      | It felt very inefficient and unoptimised. Quite frankly, it was a bit flaky just because                 |
| 43:31      | you're relying on duct tape and a wish to make all of those things work. And individually,               |
| 43:38      | each component was rock solid. [[HomeKit]] was great and the door lock is great and push                     |
| 43:44      | cut is great, but trying to connect all three of them together seemed to just end up being               |
| 43:48      | a bit tricky. And I couldn't ever quite figure out where the failure point was. So I've been             |
| 43:53      | able to solve a good chunk of that with some home assistant automations, but I've managed                |
| 43:58      | to keep all of my [[HomeKit]] automations intact because what I've done is I've backed up                    |
| 44:03      | my [[HomeKit]] setup. And then when I removed the devices from the [[HomeKit]] home because                      |
| 44:10      | I took them off of the IKEA bridge and I paired it to [[Home Assistant]] and I shared it back                |
| 44:14      | to [[HomeKit]], I could actually restore the backup that I'd created and I used controller for               |
| 44:20      | [[HomeKit]] for this. And what I could do was I could say, hey, so this device is now this                   |
| 44:27      | device and then it just linked everything back up for me. So it meant that actually nothing              |
| 44:32      | got broken. And I have to say, control of [[HomeKit]] definitely deserves a massive shout out                 |
| 44:38      | because it made that process a lot easier. And so does [[Home Assistant]] because it is an                   |
| 44:42      | incredibly powerful system that's allowed me to get rid of three hubs so far and just                    |
| 44:49      | pair everything directly.                                                                                |
| 44:50      | Okay, wait, I just want to pull a set of weeds for a minute here because you keep talking                |
| 44:54      | about [[Home Assistant]], but I'm not sure everybody knows what [[Home Assistant]] is. So what is it?            |
| 44:59      | Yeah, we've mentioned it on the show before, but if you think of [[HomeKit]], [[HomeKit]] is one                 |
| 45:05      | way to control a number of smart home devices, but they all have to be [[HomeKit]] compatible.               |
| 45:11      | What you can do instead, there's a number of different options out there. There was Samsung              |
| 45:16      | SmartThings for a while. I think that's pretty much dead now, unfortunately. There's Hubitat             |
| 45:21      | and a number of things, but [[Home Assistant]] is a very big one and it's open source. And                   |
| 45:26      | essentially, the idea is that it is a small brain that lives in your house on a computer                 |
| 45:31      | and it does a variety of different things. But on [[HomeKit]], where you have to have an                     |
| 45:39      | always-on iPad that stays at home or an Apple TV or a HomePod, you can run this on a computer            |
| 45:46      | that you might already have that's in your home. So I was running on a Raspberry Pi for                  |
| 45:51      | a while and then I ended up buying a slightly more powerful machine because I wanted to be               |
| 45:56      | able to do lots of things with data tracking. But the idea is that you run a small server                |
| 46:02      | of yourself that can manage this sort of thing, just like [[HomeKit]] can with automations and               |
| 46:07      | so on, but you can connect a number of different devices to it.                                          |
| 46:10      | Yeah, and it feels to me kind of like it's halfway between Homebridge and [[HomeKit]] in                     |
| 46:15      | some ways because you get their device and then you can put it on a Raspberry Pi, but                    |
| 46:20      | you can also just buy a premade box. In fact, I've got one on order because we're going                  |
| 46:24      | to do a show on this at some point, but they're pretty slow to deliver. I'm not sure when                |
| 46:29      | mine's coming. Someday it's just going to show up, but I have a home assistant yellow                    |
| 46:33      | on order. But then it gives you a web interface where you can have much more granular kind               |
| 46:43      | of home automation rules. Is that fair summary?                                                          |
| 46:45      | Yes.                                                                                                     |
| 46:46      | Okay.                                                                                                    |
| 46:47      | So it's not just home automation rules, but it's also a lot of the things that you can                   |
| 46:52      | do with [[Home Assistant]], you would probably struggle to do with just [[HomeKit]] or even [[HomeKit]]              |
| 47:01      | and Homebridge. So for example, I have a smart heating that came with my house. I just had               |
| 47:07      | to buy a hub to talk to it, but there is no plug-in for this for [[HomeKit]], for a Homebridge               |
| 47:14      | at all. I looked and I looked at trying to create one and it would have been quite frankly               |
| 47:19      | a bit of a nightmare. And then I looked in [[Home Assistant]] and there wasn't a plug-in                     |
| 47:24      | that somebody had made. They made an add-on. And the difference between the two, I'm not                 |
| 47:29      | going to go into here because it's not important for the terms of the show, but somebody had             |
| 47:33      | made something that I could try and it worked. And basically what they're doing is they're               |
| 47:39      | using a different protocol. It's not like Zigbee, it's a messaging protocol, but they                    |
| 47:47      | can actually talk directly to this. And [[Home Assistant]] itself supports it. So essentially                |
| 47:52      | they're just bridging between the two of those. And that's something they can do because                 |
| 47:57      | [[Home Assistant]] already supports all of this. And that is very nice to be able to do. And                 |
| 48:04      | also [[Home Assistant]] has an API that I can use. So if I want to get nerdy with shortcuts,                 |
| 48:09      | I could, but it's got some pretty good shortcut sections as well. So there are a number of               |
| 48:15      | things that you can do like easily create fake buttons or switches and things like that                  |
| 48:20      | that you might want to use so that your home knows when you're asleep and doesn't turn                   |
| 48:24      | on all the lights every time you roll over in bed. That's very easy to do, whereas you                   |
| 48:28      | would need a series of different Home Bridge plugins and to create automations in the Home               |
| 48:32      | App and then modify them in, say, Home Plus to be able to avoid the lights turning on                    |
| 48:38      | while you're asleep.                                                                                     |
| 48:39      | Well, I mean, I feel like that's the next level for you. The [[Home Assistant]] has changed                  |
| 48:44      | your game for a lot of this stuff.                                                                       |
| 48:47      | Yes. Yes, it has. But I've also very much tried to keep things much the same way they                    |
| 48:52      | were previously because what I had previously generally was working. And what I am attempting            |
| 48:57      | to do is not create 101 problems, but instead to solve the problems that I was having before             |
| 49:03      | I move on to the next thing. So the first problem that I was having was that my washing                  |
| 49:08      | machine and my tumbler I do not beep when they finish. And I did not know that they'd                    |
| 49:11      | finish their cycles and I would forget about laundry. And so I was able to set up energy                 |
| 49:16      | tracking with [[Home Assistant]] and get push notifications when those devices finished,                     |
| 49:20      | which was great. And my next challenge is figuring out what exactly is the correct radius for            |
| 49:26      | me arriving home where I want the lights to turn on, but the lights won't have been on                   |
| 49:29      | for five minutes from walking home.                                                                      |
| 49:32      | Well, good luck with that.                                                                               |
| 49:34      | You're going to have to walk me through. It's going to be a challenge. When mine shows up,               |
| 49:38      | you have to walk me through because it's new to me, but I am super interested in the ability             |
| 49:42      | to add more conditions to my rules and make home automation more powerful. I think Apple                 |
| 49:47      | is actually doing a pretty good job with [[HomeKit]], but it also is kind of the least common denominator.   |
| 49:52      | You know, it'd be nice if you could go further with this. The other thing [[Home Assistant]] looks           |
| 49:56      | like it's going to give me is the ability to use devices that aren't made for [[HomeKit]],                   |
| 50:00      | which will be nice.                                                                                      |
| 50:01      | Yeah, yeah. It is great that you can do that. So I have a smart smoke detector, but there                |
| 50:08      | are I think the only smart smoke detector available in the UK is the Netatmo one, which                  |
| 50:11      | is fairly pricey. I bought a 10 pound Zigbee smart smoke detector and it works exactly                |
| 50:18      | the same way as a regular smart smoke detector, except I also paired it to [[Home Assistant]] and            |
| 50:22      | shared it to [[HomeKit]] and I attempted to test it. It was really difficult. Like I had to                  |
| 50:29      | actually have to set several light several candles underneath it and close a bunch of                    |
| 50:35      | doors to trigger it, but it works exactly the same way you would expect a [[HomeKit]] one                    |
| 50:39      | to do. I got a push notification to my phone. So I was really, really pleased about that                 |
| 50:45      | and it was only 10 pounds versus I think it was 60 or 80 pounds for the Netatmo one.                     |
| 50:50      | So there can be quite a price difference, but it does come with a bit of a trade off                     |
| 50:54      | of you have to install [[Home Assistant]] on something or buy [[Home Assistant]] blue or yellow. I've            |
| 50:59      | think blue is not available in the US anymore and yellow is only on pre-order right now,                 |
| 51:03      | but it does give you a great interface for editing automations, which for me is definitely               |
| 51:10      | something I'm very excited by.                                                                           |
| 51:12      | Now, you're also, I guess, at war against your hubs, right?                                              |
| 51:16      | Yeah. Yeah, I kind of am. So originally I bought the Aqara M1S, which is a round, white                  |
| 51:24      | round plug, which kind of looks like a doorbell chime, because it also functions as a doorbell           |
| 51:29      | chime with a light around it that you just plug into the wall and it's Wi-Fi. And at                     |
| 51:35      | the time, I thought, 32 devices? I'm not going to hit 32 devices. Editor, note, Rose                     |
| 51:43      | hit 32 devices much quicker than Rose had anticipated. Surprise. And so I ended up needing               |
| 51:50      | another Aqara hub. And so I bought the Aqara M2 hub, and the Aqara M2 hub is great, but                  |
| 51:56      | migrating things between the devices or between the hubs started breaking some of my automations.        |
| 52:03      | And it was at this point that I had already bought a Zigbee dongle for [[Home Assistant]] because            |
| 52:07      | I wanted to try the smart smoke detector because I was, I got woken up at three o'clock in               |
| 52:13      | the morning by the smoke detector going, beep, I'm running out of battery, beep, I'm running             |
| 52:17      | out of battery, which is everybody's worst nightmare. So being able to check the battery                 |
| 52:21      | level from Home Kid and [[Home Assistant]] is really useful. And so I bought this dongle                     |
| 52:26      | and I thought, you know, if I'm moving things from one device to another, why don't I just               |
| 52:32      | try pairing the Aqara stuff straight into [[Home Assistant]]? And it worked. It worked really,               |
| 52:38      | really well. And then I realised that I could get a bit nerdier and combine two devices so                |
| 52:45      | that if both the motion sensors on my chair notice something, then actually, or if either                |
| 52:51      | motion sensor on my chair notices something in my office, then that appears as motion                    |
| 52:56      | in my office. And that then gets shared as one thing.                                                    |
| 52:59      | Wait, wait, wait, gross. Two motion sensors on your chair?                                               |
| 53:03      | Yeah, I decided to experiment because I realised that basically whichever way I put a motion             |
| 53:10      | sensor on my chair, there's a chance that it won't notice how I'm moving because I either                |
| 53:15      | move from side to side or I move backwards and forwards. And depending on how I've got                   |
| 53:21      | my chair set up, it may not notice one of the movements. So for example, if I just lean                  |
| 53:26      | backwards a little bit, then the seat itself doesn't move because I've got a really great                |
| 53:29      | chair. But if I just move from side to side, the back doesn't move or it does, but it does               |
| 53:36      | not move enough. So I played with a bunch of different options and I decided that I                      |
| 53:40      | was going to try because I bought another vibration sensor sticking another one on there.                |
| 53:48      | And yeah, so I now have two sensors on my chair, David. That was not planned, but it's                   |
| 53:53      | working really, really well.                                                                             |
| 53:55      | That is one of the reasons why you're one of my favourite people, Rose, that you put two                  |
| 54:00      | motion sensors on your chair. I love that.                                                               |
| 54:03      | Well, then what I did is I combined them through [[Home Assistant]] so that they just show up as             |
| 54:07      | one. So if either of them sees movement, then it just shows up as my office chair is occupied            |
| 54:15      | because I set it to occupied versus not occupied. But I've combined the two of them because              |
| 54:20      | in [[HomeKit]], I don't want to see whether or not one of them, the seat or the back, has                    |
| 54:26      | detected motion. I don't care about that. And then I took it a step further and went,                    |
| 54:30      | literally, I don't care about the other motion sensors in my office either. I just care about            |
| 54:34      | whether or not my office is occupied. And I combined all of them into an office occupancy                |
| 54:39      | sensor, which I use to control lights. And then I combined my computer into that as well.                |
| 54:45      | So if my computer is on, then it considers my office to be occupied because I will be                    |
| 54:52      | most likely sitting here at it or coming back briefly because it will go to sleep relatively             |
| 54:57      | quickly.                                                                                                 |
| 54:58      | Okay. So now I just want to know when my [[Home Assistant]] yellow is going to ship. That's                  |
| 55:03      | all I want to know.                                                                                      |
| 55:04      | I mean, probably quite soon. I don't know. I don't remember exactly when it's going                      |
| 55:09      | to ship. I should note for anybody who's going, oh, that sounds interesting. The [[Home Assistant]]          |
| 55:14      | docs are really good. And they've got full install guides for everybody. So if you have                  |
| 55:19      | a Raspberry Pi at home already, you could install [[Home Assistant]] on it and have a play.                  |
| 55:26      | And that's what I did with [[Home Assistant]] operating system. And it worked really, really well            |
| 55:31      | for me.                                                                                                  |
| 55:32      | I should do that.                                                                                        |
| 55:33      | I'm really enjoying it.                                                                                  |
| 55:34      | But since I've already ordered this one, I think I'm just going to wait. But yeah.                       |
| 55:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                    |
| 55:38      | Now, when are you shipping? This all sounds like fun.                                                    |
| 55:42      | It is a lot of fun. And it's also pretty nice to be able to shop from a much wider array                 |
| 55:48      | of smart home devices than are just available to [[HomeKit]]. So for example, when I got my                  |
| 55:54      | Yale locks here in the UK, Yale didn't have a [[HomeKit]] hub out. It just wasn't an option.                 |
| 56:02      | But they did have Z-Wave plug-ins that you could put inside the devices. And I could                     |
| 56:08      | have bought, I think, as a Z-Wave hub from them, but that wasn't a [[HomeKit]] compatible.                   |
| 56:13      | But [[Home Assistant]] can share things into [[HomeKit]]. And so I bought a Z-Wave dongle for a Home             |
| 56:18      | Assistant. That was the original reason for me getting into [[Home Assistant]] properly and                  |
| 56:24      | trying it really was because I wanted to get smart door locks and I wanted them in [[HomeKit]].              |
| 56:30      | So I bought a Z-Wave dongle and mine's an Aeotec, I believe it is, and plugged that                      |
| 56:36      | into [[Home Assistant]]. And then I paired my Yale locks to it. And I got a push notification                |
| 56:43      | just five minutes ago saying, hey, your door lock battery is running low. You probably                   |
| 56:47      | want to fix that. So I will go after the show and replace the batteries in my door lock.                 |
| 56:51      | But that set got me smart door locks and it got me [[HomeKit]] compatible smart door locks                   |
| 56:58      | that I can control with Siri. And that's how I usually unlock my doors. But I didn't have                |
| 57:05      | to wait for Yale to finally release a door lock because one of the doors I wanted to                     |
| 57:11      | control is a multi-point lock where you have to lift the handle to engage the lock before                |
| 57:15      | you can lock it. And there aren't that many locks which are compatible with that. And                    |
| 57:22      | a lot of the smart locks that you can get would just try to lock if the door was closed,                 |
| 57:26      | which will not work with a multi-point lock. And so I really wanted something that would                 |
| 57:30      | work and if I was getting one Yale lock, I figured get two because then both of them                     |
| 57:34      | will pair. And I'm really, really pleased with them, I have to say, and it works really,                 |
| 57:39      | really well.                                                                                             |
| 57:40      | So where do you draw the line between [[Home Assistant]] stuff and [[HomeKit]] stuff?                            |
| 57:45      | I don't really. I try to look at what is the best solution because if I can get it into                  |
| 57:52      | [[Home Assistant]], I can get it back into [[HomeKit]]. And if it's something that's [[HomeKit]] only,               |
| 57:58      | I can actually pair it into [[Home Assistant]] because [[Home Assistant]] has the ability                        |
| 58:02      | to pretend to be [[HomeKit]], essentially. So I actually have an air purifier that I bought                  |
| 58:08      | before I got into [[Home Assistant]]. And it took a while to arrive. It was not Kickstarter.                 |
| 58:14      | The other one, Indiegogo, is an Indiegogo project. And it's a lovely air purifier. It's                  |
| 58:20      | very swish, fancy designer, all sorts of things. But it is [[HomeKit]], not any kind of local protocol,      |
| 58:27      | except for that. But I was able to get it into [[Home Assistant]] through [[HomeKit]] and then I can             |
| 58:33      | control all of my air purifiers in one place. And I didn't have to do that, but I did it                 |
| 58:40      | because I was curious. And it's quite nice to be able to look at a view just for my living room          |
| 58:46      | and see the air purifier for that room. Whereas if I look at the bedroom view, I see the air             |
| 58:50      | purifier in that room, which wasn't [[HomeKit]] compatible. It's a Tuya one. But I have the                  |
| 58:57      | best of all of the worlds, essentially, because if I want to do something in [[HomeKit]],                    |
| 59:01      | I can do it because I can share everything back to [[HomeKit]]. But if [[Home Assistant]] is going to            |
| 59:05      | be the easiest way to solve a problem, or the best way to solve the problem because it will              |
| 59:10      | allow me to extend it, then I can solve it there as well. So pretend you live with people who are        |
| 59:15      | not as nerdy as you. Yeah. Are they able to get into [[HomeKit]] to see the rules? I mean,                   |
| 59:20      | can you live with somebody else is I guess what I'm asking, like with [[HomeKit]]? Well,                     |
| 59:24      | I guess the question is, why do they need to see the rules? Yeah. Because [[Home Assistant]],                |
| 59:30      | everybody can have their own account, and it's got an iOS app, it's got an Apple Watch app.              |
| 59:36      | And so they can log in. And if you share things with them, like the automations and so on,               |
| 59:42      | you give them access to it, then they'll be able to see and edit all of those things.                    |
| 59:46      | The same as you can share that access through [[HomeKit]]. But ideally, my aim for every setup is            |
| 59:52      | that I create it in such a way that it should just do what you expect without you needing to do          |
| 01:00:00   | anything. So you walk into the bathroom and the light turns on. And very occasionally,                   |
| 01:00:04   | while I'm debugging things or setting something up, that might not be the case. But if that's            |
| 01:00:08   | the case, either don't invite people over or I turn that off and revert it to a manual control           |
| 01:00:14   | while those people are here. And then I turn it back on and continue tweaking afterwards.                |
| 01:00:18   | And as I asked the question I'm thinking, yeah, with my house, like my wife and kids access,             |
| 01:00:24   | the individual switches, like they'll tap the button to turn the kitchen lights on.                      |
| 01:00:28   | But they're not going to be doing the automation stuff. They either just benefit from it,                |
| 01:00:33   | or they suffer from it if I don't do it right.                                                           |
| 01:00:36   | Yes, yes. And hopefully with the freaking complaints of it's not working. Because otherwise,             |
| 01:00:41   | you might not know it's not working for them. But yes, my aim is really try to make the magic            |
| 01:00:47   | happen so that it does just do the thing without needing to tap the buttons and do things. So            |
| 01:00:54   | if I walk into my hallway during the day when it's quite light, it will turn on the light                |
| 01:00:57   | dimly. And if it's the middle of the night when I have been asleep because I've got to go to the         |
| 01:01:01   | bathroom, again, the lights in the hallway are dim. But aside from that, within half an hour of          |
| 01:01:06   | sunset, up until it gets bright enough in the morning, it will turn on the lights to be fully            |
| 01:01:12   | bright. And that's yet to confuse my parents when they come over and visit. And I think they're          |
| 01:01:18   | fairly good barometer for, you know, does this thing do what you would expect? They walk into a          |
| 01:01:26   | room and it provides the amount of light that they need. And, you know, the bathroom is on               |
| 01:01:31   | and off the light in there is either on or it's off. But if you go in there and then you close           |
| 01:01:37   | the door, it will leave the light on until you've opened the door and left. Because the last thing       |
| 01:01:42   | you want is the light turning off in the middle of a shower.                                             |

| 01:02:05   | you're never looking for something and not finding it. [[DEVONthink]] features a flexible                   |
| 01:02:09   | sync system that supports many cloud services or lets you synchronise over the local network too         |
| 01:02:14   | with everything securely encrypted. It secures you the choice for however syncing works best for         |
| 01:02:18   | you. It has smart rules and flexible reminders that let you automate all parts of your workflow          |
| 01:02:23   | and delegate boring repeating tasks. Let [[DEVONthink]] automatically organise your data with rules         |
| 01:02:28   | you define. [[DEVONthink]]'s [[AppleScript]] Dictionary is one of the largest on the Mac. There's no           |
| 01:02:32   | part of [[DEVONthink]] that can't be automated. Except when [[DEVONthink]]'s functionality with                |
| 01:02:36   | your own commands by adding them into a scripts menu. Even templates can have scripts inside             |
| 01:02:40   | and you can set up new documents from data with placeholders or inserted by your own [[AppleScript]]        |
| 01:02:45   | Code. And of course there's so much more from an iOS companion app to email archiving, scanning,         |
| 01:02:50   | or even an embedded web server for sharing your data securely with your team. I did mention earlier      |
| 01:02:55   | on the show that I personally use and love [[DEVONthink]] and I would say that even if they weren't         |
| 01:02:59   | sponsoring today's episode, but one of the features I've been using recently is the Convert              |
| 01:03:03   | File feature. Because [[DEVONthink]] automatically imports email and with Convert File you can              |
| 01:03:08   | actually convert it to a PDF. Yup, so my emails get imported and converted into PDFs automatically.      |
| 01:03:14   | Perfect for accounting. So if you think that you need somewhere where you can organise your files        |
| 01:03:19   | and easily find them, and maybe even convert some documents, check out [[DEVONthink]]. You can get 10%      |

| 01:03:40   | but what about dealing with applications that don't want to automate, you know,                          |
| 01:03:45   | that they're out there, apps that don't have hooks for all the various automation platforms              |
| 01:03:49   | you like? How do you deal with those? Yeah, so there's been a reasonable amount of this recently         |
| 01:03:56   | where I've been just dealing with weird things that don't do what I want them to do. And a lot           |
| 01:04:03   | of what I have done is dig around until I find a way to fix the problem. Now in one particular case      |
| 01:04:10   | it ended up actually with Rose goes and uses a different application because I was trying                |
| 01:04:15   | to get the terminal to open in three windows and do three different things. And I wanted those           |
| 01:04:22   | windows positioned in a different way. And I could get terminal to open three windows.                   |
| 01:04:28   | And I could get them positioned, but getting the correct one to do the correct command                   |
| 01:04:34   | was not working for me. So I ended up switching to item. But a lot of what I've been doing recently,     |
| 01:04:39   | it has been a little bit of AppleScript where possible or where necessary, maybe text expansion         |
| 01:04:46   | in a few places and [[Keyboard Maestro]] just stepping in and rescuing me in all the places where usually    |
| 01:04:53   | this thing would be disabled. But actually in this particular scenario, I wanted to happen. So           |
| 01:04:58   | [[Keyboard Maestro]] bridges a gap to make magic. Can you give me an example? Yeah, so I don't use text      |
| 01:05:06   | expansion when I'm programming. I say I don't use text expansion. That's not strictly true.              |
| 01:05:11   | I don't use my standard text expansion. So my standard text expansion I've got mostly in             |
| 01:05:18   | TextExpander. But there's also some things in [[Alfred]], because that was a fun experiment and why not.         |
| 01:05:26   | And there's the odd thing in [[Keyboard Maestro]]. But the ones in TextExpander and the ones in             |
| 01:05:31   | [[Alfred]] do not run in my development applications, just because they will end up accidentally interfering |
| 01:05:39   | with what I'm doing in various ways. Now, the programs that I use themselves, they do have               |
| 01:05:45   | text expansion, they've got autocomplete, things like that. But there are certain things that I          |
| 01:05:50   | do want available, but only in those applications. But I don't have every app. So for example,           |
| 01:05:58   | my work machine, I don't have TextExpander installed. There's a number of reasons for that.             |
| 01:06:03   | But it's just something that because I'm not writing words, I didn't feel like I needed a lot            |
| 01:06:08   | of the time. But I did need some text expansion. So I have [[Keyboard Maestro]] run some macros only         |
| 01:06:18   | in those applications. And I've got some smart groups that are just for my development applications.     |
| 01:06:24   | But it's even smarter than that in that it looks at the name of the window, and it checks what the       |
| 01:06:29   | file extension is in the name of the window. And then if it's a PHP file, it will do one thing.          |
| 01:06:36   | And if it's a JavaScript file, it will do a different thing and so on and so forth so that               |
| 01:06:40   | I can type whatever my magic incantation is. And I get exactly the right result for whatever          |
| 01:06:46   | language I'm programming in, which is I think something I would have struggled to do with                |
| 01:06:51   | just playing text expansion. But I was really pleased to be able to sort that out with keyboard          |
| 01:06:55   | maestro. Yeah. I mean, [[Keyboard Maestro]] does come to the rescue so often, doesn't it?                    |
| 01:07:00   | Yeah. Yeah. It was one of those things where I was so nearly there. And then I remembered                |
| 01:07:05   | the [[Keyboard Maestro]] can get the name of the window. And that was the bit that just made                 |
| 01:07:11   | everything click. Because once I figured that out, I figured out not only my text expansions,            |
| 01:07:16   | but also when I hit save, I needed to do a particular sequence events. I need to activate                |
| 01:07:22   | the terminal or iTerm as it is now so that I can actually look and see the thing and make sure           |
| 01:07:27   | that everything's compiling. And then if that's fine, then I can go over to Firefox and refresh          |
| 01:07:32   | the page. But I don't want that to happen when I'm editing certain files. And so because I can           |
| 01:07:39   | check which files I'm editing, thanks to the property, which is the title of the window,                 |
| 01:07:45   | I can make different magic happen. And that was one of those things where, yeah,                         |
| 01:07:52   | I really had one puzzle piece fall into place and realised, wow, yeah, this is incredibly                |
| 01:07:59   | powerful. Because I was able to reuse that with [[Audio Hijack]]. Because [[Audio Hijack]] by session has        |
| 01:08:06   | the name. And so if it's automators in the name, it's now going to do automators magic. Whereas          |
| 01:08:12   | if it says nested folders, it'll do nested folders magic and so on and so forth. So it's                 |
| 01:08:16   | mostly been [[Keyboard Maestro]] to the rescue. But there has been a little help with iTerm as well.         |
| 01:08:22   | Okay, you want me to blow your mind a little bit? Maybe you already know this.                           |
| 01:08:26   | There's a cool plugin for [[Obsidian]] called custom window title, very simple plugin,                       |
| 01:08:32   | takes the name of the current note and puts it in the title of the window. And suddenly,                 |
| 01:08:37   | once it's in the title of the window that opens up all these automation possibilities                    |
| 01:08:42   | when I'm working in a [[Obsidian]] note that has the word automators in the title.                           |
| 01:08:47   | Or that also the way I use that is with the timing app, the timing app that is time tracking.            |
| 01:08:54   | Now it tracks time based on that window. It doesn't just say time in [[Obsidian]]. It'll say                 |
| 01:09:00   | time on the automators file. And so it's like, it's like once you change the name of the window          |
| 01:09:05   | title, it opens up automation possibilities with something like [[Keyboard Maestro]]. It's pretty            |
| 01:09:09   | cool. Anyway, it's a very small plugin. And it's currently version 0.3.3. I don't even know what         |
| 01:09:17   | that means. Wouldn't it be version one if it's out? But I don't know. It might just be that              |
| 01:09:23   | it's the developer considers it's so small that he's not or she's not given it a 1.0 yet,                |
| 01:09:30   | or there's also features that they've not yet made. Yeah, well, either way,                              |
| 01:09:34   | it's a great little plugin that I'm running it. And that might help you if you want to automate          |
| 01:09:39   | some of that. Like based on opening an [[Obsidian]] document, you could trigger that automation.             |
| 01:09:44   | Yes, yes. That is definitely something that I will be looking into. It's one of those things.            |
| 01:09:52   | I do automate a lot of things around [[Obsidian]], but it's mostly the creation of documents in              |
| 01:09:57   | folders and things like that rather than actually going into and reading things out of it just yet.      |
| 01:10:04   | Maybe that needs to be a feature show. I've done some work there.                                        |
| 01:10:08   | So maybe that's something we'll talk about one day. Well, that is definitely something I will be         |
| 01:10:14   | looking for. Another thing that I've been playing with is there are some great menu bar apps and         |
| 01:10:22   | [[Safari]] extensions on the Mac, which have been solving a number of different problems for me.             |
| 01:10:28   | So one of them is, and I'm now going to get this wrong because it's gone and hidden from me,             |
| 01:10:33   | the name of the application. It's the little house with the lightning icon in it in my menu bar,         |
| 01:10:38   | and it's called [[HomeControl Menu for HomeKit\|HomeControl]]. That's one. And [[HomeControl Menu for HomeKit\|HomeControl]] gives me all of the devices, scenes,          |
| 01:10:45   | groups, smart group, sensors, etc. from [[HomeKit]] in my menu bar so that when I click on it,               |
| 01:10:52   | I can see all of those things. I should mention that [[Home Assistant]] does also have an application        |
| 01:10:57   | for the Mac, and that's good. It works really well and it gets a bunch of sensors into it,               |
| 01:11:03   | but for a lot of the things that I'm doing where I just want specific scenes,                            |
| 01:11:08   | it's pretty great to just click and be able to go blind, set to closed or open or turn this light        |
| 01:11:15   | on or turn this light off and things like that without having to open the application,                   |
| 01:11:19   | which has been very helpful. And this also has an automation option where you can get                    |
| 01:11:25   | a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] for each individual item or scene or device and run that through something else so          |
| 01:11:33   | you can integrate smart home scenes into [[Keyboard Maestro]] without having to run an entire shortcut       |
| 01:11:41   | just to set a smart home scene because the Home app for some reason is still really not                  |
| 01:11:46   | automatable on macOS. I really don't know what's going on there. Of course, I can do it on iOS,          |
| 01:11:51   | but having all of the options everywhere is something that I am hoping to have when it                   |
| 01:11:57   | comes to a lot of these automation possibilities. No, I agree. And of course, that's the trick to        |
| 01:12:02   | get it into your [[Stream Deck]] as well. Because once you have a URL, then only can you trigger it          |
| 01:12:08   | from [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can insert the URL into a [[Stream Deck]] button, which is kind of fun.           |
| 01:12:14   | Exactly, yes. And it is really useful for that. I've been enjoying it. There's                           |
| 01:12:21   | a couple of [[Safari]] extensions. You mentioned Home Safe before. It's not really an automation option,     |
| 01:12:27   | but it does allow me to get the image from the Key Image from a web page, which can be really            |
| 01:12:33   | helpful when I'm building a shopping list for a store that I'm going to go to so I actually have         |
| 01:12:37   | a picture of the thing that I'm looking for. But one that I have only found out about recently,          |
| 01:12:43   | but is really cool is URL linker. And it's, I think it was $199 or even free in the Mac app              |
| 01:12:50   | store. But it means that when I right click on any page in [[Safari]], I can copy the URL,                   |
| 01:12:58   | but then I can set up preferences. So because it copies as markdown format. So you get your              |
| 01:13:05   | square brackets, the title of the page, round brackets, URL, but you can have, you can add               |
| 01:13:10   | your own formats. So if you need a different format, so say for example, you're on one particular        |
| 01:13:16   | page and you always want to copy it with a prefix, then you can create a format for that. And you've     |
| 01:13:22   | just got title and URL parameters, and you can use that anywhere. And it's a very simple                 |
| 01:13:28   | application, but it really does make it very easy to just copy whatever I need as a markdown link,       |
| 01:13:35   | because most of the time I'm writing a markdown, but I can also do it with HTML,                         |
| 01:13:38   | which is something that I've been using at work.                                                         |
| 01:13:40   | Well, what are some other ways you get around apps that don't want to automate?                          |
| 01:13:46   | I mean, there is the good old fashioned keep, keep a sure click at image. But one other thing            |
| 01:13:52   | that I have been doing recently is I have two applications at work that really don't want to             |
| 01:13:58   | talk to each other. The system where I can book my holiday and my calendar. And my calendar,             |
| 01:14:03   | I can work around because it's on my Mac. The system where I book my holiday, it's a web system,         |
| 01:14:09   | and it doesn't play ball. But I found that there is a way to get an ICS file out of it.                  |
| 01:14:17   | But the URL is hidden. So I ended up creating a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that takes the URL                |
| 01:14:23   | of the [[Safari]] page, and it reworks it a little bit, it replaces some text, and then it opens a new       |
| 01:14:30   | URL, which will then have automatically download the ICS file, which was really, really helpful,         |
| 01:14:36   | until they finally figured it out. And then three weeks later, they added the button. So I can do        |
| 01:14:43   | it directly. But that was a way around that because I went through their documentation and I asked,      |
| 01:14:48   | and somebody said, well, here's the URL for this. And I was able to look at the two URLs that I had      |
| 01:14:54   | and figure out what the difference was and just replace things until it worked. So that was quite        |
| 01:14:59   | helpful. So being able to create a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that didn't click at an image,                 |
| 01:15:03   | and I could have done it with shortcuts, and maybe I should have because it would have got the front     |
| 01:15:07   | most [[Safari]] window. But I do use Firefox and [[Google Chrome\|Chrome]] as well at work because I'm a web developer,         |
| 01:15:12   | and I have to use all the browsers. Now, talking to you, I get the impression that,                      |
| 01:15:18   | like, when you have to, like, roll up your sleeves for an automation that you generally                  |
| 01:15:22   | are using JavaScript, as opposed to AppleScript, what is the balance for you between AppleScript         |
| 01:15:28   | and other languages? I mean, it really depends. Honestly, if I'm actually going to be writing            |
| 01:15:34   | a script to automate something on the Mac, I am not going to use JavaScript. JavaScript for              |
| 01:15:39   | automation is one of those things that was a lovely idea. And when I say JavaScript for                  |
| 01:15:43   | automation, I'm talking specifically the JavaScript version of AppleScript, not JavaScript, as you       |
| 01:15:48   | would find it in [[Drafts]] or similar. But it was a wonderful idea. And I love what they were going         |
| 01:15:54   | for. But somehow, it just does not have all the same event hooks as AppleScript, which means that        |
| 01:16:02   | you can write the same script in AppleScript and JavaScript. And the AppleScript one will work           |
| 01:16:08   | consistently. And the JavaScript one will just sometimes randomly stop or miss something or not          |
| 01:16:14   | be triggered or not do something that you would expect. And I don't know why that is. I've talked        |
| 01:16:19   | to a number of different people. And essentially, the running theory appears to be that it didn't        |
| 01:16:24   | quite get hooked up in all the same places. And so therefore, it sometimes just doesn't work,            |
| 01:16:30   | which is a real shame. So I am using AppleScript for anything very specifically Mac. But where I'm       |
| 01:16:38   | doing something that will be multi-platform, where I want it on my iPhone as well, I will go             |
| 01:16:43   | with JavaScript because I can write JavaScript and use it in [[Drafts]]. I can use it in [[Obsidian]].           |
| 01:16:47   | I can use it in Scriptable. I could use it in the browser. And I can use it on my Mac or my iPhone       |
| 01:16:52   | or my iPad, which means that it works anywhere, which is really, really nice. Because the last           |
| 01:16:59   | thing I want is to sit down and go, oh, yeah, I wanted to do this. Oh, now I need my Mac. Right.         |
| 01:17:06   | Yeah. No, that's not happening. I feel like I'm doing more AppleScript than I have in a while            |
| 01:17:11   | because of the Apple Silicon Macs. And they have an all day battery. And like all of a sudden, I'm       |
| 01:17:18   | doing less work on the iPad. So I don't mind having Mac only automation. And AppleScript for Mac is      |
| 01:17:25   | so good. I mean, there's so many apps that are really hooked into it. So you can do a lot of cool        |
| 01:17:30   | stuff with AppleScript. But I don't know that that's the long term play. What do you think is the        |
| 01:17:36   | long term play from Apple? I mean, so clearly Shortcuts, they've said is the future and they're          |
| 01:17:42   | going to try and do more shortcut stuff. But are they going to have an AppleScript like language         |
| 01:17:49   | that goes across all their platforms? I mean, I've heard people speculate that they think [[SwiftUI]]       |
| 01:17:55   | is going to have an automation version that that's the plan. But I don't know. I mean, what do you       |
| 01:18:01   | think? I mean, [[Swift]] is an automation language, definitely would have a lot of advantages.               |
| 01:18:07   | It's already on all of Apple's platforms. [[SwiftUI]], the framework, is not necessarily the right          |
| 01:18:15   | thing. I misspoke there. I'm sorry, [[Swift]], not [[SwiftUI]], yes. Yeah. And [[Swift]] has got a lot of           |
| 01:18:20   | advantages to it. It is perhaps a bit trickier for people who are familiar with some other programming   |
| 01:18:29   | languages, but are not necessarily developers, because there are some certain things that are            |
| 01:18:33   | flipped. So for example, in JavaScript, if you create a variable and you want it to be a constant        |
| 01:18:41   | variable, you create it with the name const. And if you want something that's flexible, you use let.     |
| 01:18:46   | If you use the word let in [[Swift]], that is a constant. And so just things like that will trip             |
| 01:18:51   | up people who are a bit newer to language, which is a bit of a shame, perhaps, but also, you know,       |
| 01:18:56   | there's reasons behind why they've created [[Swift]], the way they've created it. And it's an                |
| 01:19:01   | incredibly powerful language. So it would be lovely. But I feel like maybe because JavaScript            |
| 01:19:08   | was already on every device as something that, for example, agile torches could just bundle              |
| 01:19:14   | into [[Drafts]] and expose to people. And it's used in [[Obsidian]] and other things. It's                       |
| 01:19:22   | perhaps accidentally gained a lot of momentum as an automation language.                                 |
| 01:19:29   | And I feel like Apple would probably be missing out on something quite amazing if they                   |
| 01:19:36   | bucked the trend and said, no, no, no, no, no, no, like [[Swift]] is the future. [[Swift]] is the future         |
| 01:19:40   | here. They can do that when it comes to development, because the developers don't really have a choice.  |
| 01:19:46   | If they want to develop for Apple platforms, then it's objective to see or [[Swift]]. But when it comes      |
| 01:19:53   | to automation languages, you know, the Omni Group have spent a lot of time creating Omni                 |
| 01:19:59   | Automation with [[Sal Soghoian]] for all of their apps, agile torches has got everything. You know,           |
| 01:20:05   | [[Simon Støvring]] created Scriptable, created Scriptable, which essentially bridges a ton of [[Swift]]          |
| 01:20:11   | into JavaScript. You know, Apple could do that. They could say, no, no, no, it's [[Swift]] from now          |
| 01:20:18   | on out. And I'm sure it would do fine. But I think it would end up being more like Apple                 |
| 01:20:25   | Script in the sense that it's considered a relatively niche, odd thing. The significant                  |
| 01:20:34   | advantage for it would be that developers would be able to create a whole bunch of automations to        |
| 01:20:38   | help them as part of their development process, because they're already writing [[Swift]]. But               |
| 01:20:45   | I don't know. I feel like if they're going to do something, they should probably go with                 |
| 01:20:48   | JavaScript, because it's just the one that's there. I mean, they added the action. This was              |
| 01:20:54   | what I was 13 of run JavaScript on [[Safari]] page, where you can run essentially a bookmarklet              |
| 01:21:00   | on the [[Safari]] web page through shortcuts and then get that information back.                             |
| 01:21:11   | There's the option when they added shortcuts to the Mac, they added a run JavaScript for Mac             |
| 01:21:18   | automation, along with the run AppleScript automation. I have a feeling AppleScript is                 |
| 01:21:22   | probably not going anywhere. But I hope maybe that somebody goes in and has a poke around with           |
| 01:21:29   | JavaScript for Mac and tries to find some of that weirdness that I've been experiencing.                 |
| 01:21:34   | And I know a lot of other people have as well. I do think that it's probably more work to take           |
| 01:21:38   | AppleScript out than to just leave it in. So that's probably what they're going to do.                  |
| 01:21:43   | But I hope you're right on JavaScript. I would like to see a unified scripting language across           |
| 01:21:48   | all Apple platforms. And I feel like they must have a plan for it. I would hope. And it seems            |
| 01:21:55   | like they hinted at it last year in [[WWDC]] when they talked about how the shortcuts on the Mac             |
| 01:22:02   | is just the beginning. And my fingers are crossed and I'm really hoping that they have got a good        |
| 01:22:09   | answer for that. Yes. So do I. And I do hope that maybe we end up with all the options. Maybe they       |
| 01:22:18   | go in and they fix JavaScript and add [[Swift]] at the same time. Because that would be pretty amazing.      |
| 01:22:25   | And I have to say, you know, if people ask me, you know, which automation language should I              |
| 01:22:30   | learn, I usually recommend JavaScript just because it opens up so many more options in so many more      |
| 01:22:36   | apps than AppleScript does. I mean, AppleScript is great assuming that you're on the Mac.              |
| 01:22:41   | But our lives are becoming more and more mobile. We're working from home. And, you know, sometimes       |
| 01:22:48   | that does involve working from the sofa or the breakfast bar or wherever ends up being convenient        |
| 01:22:53   | because, you know, unexpected work on your house or guests or something and you just need to get         |
| 01:22:59   | out of the way. Being able to do all of your things everywhere is definitely something that              |
| 01:23:05   | should not be taken for granted. And, you know, especially for those people who've got a desktop,        |
| 01:23:11   | it's, you know, if they're looking at buying another device, it's probably going to be an iPad,          |
| 01:23:16   | not a laptop if they don't feel like they need a laptop 99% of the time, but they would quite            |
| 01:23:21   | like an iPad. So they should be able to do their work on it. And I think adding [[Swift]] as a scripting     |
| 01:23:26   | language on iOS is much less likely than opening up shortcuts some more and giving people some           |
| 01:23:33   | extra JavaScript that they can run with it. This episode of Automators is brought to you by              |

| 01:25:05   | So there's one place that I benefit from your automation and that is the automation you've put           |
| 01:25:10   | in place to work on show development for automators. I know you've got three podcasts and you put some   |
| 01:25:16   | effort into that. How are you automating podcasting? I don't think anybody is going to be surprised if   |
| 01:25:22   | I say air table. It's the magic word. But essentially, I've got four air table databases                 |
| 01:25:32   | which drive a lot of the podcasting things for me. I have four because iOS today has feedback            |
| 01:25:38   | which gets shared with Micah and I wanted my personal stuff to not end up taking up                      |
| 01:25:44   | all of the feedback base. So I just split those into two separate things. But you and I have             |
| 01:25:49   | got a pretty great air table base which has all of our future episodes in. It's got all of our guests.   |
| 01:25:57   | They're not actually living in the base. We do let them escape occasionally.                             |
| 01:26:01   | I hear the Twitch studios are nice from the last time we let Micah out. But all of these give me         |
| 01:26:07   | a lot of data which I can then access in a lot of other places. So I've been using a lot of Zap here     |
| 01:26:13   | and some of this is migrated to [[Make]] which very recently rebranded from [[Make\|Integromat]].                      |
| 01:26:21   | And those do things like watch certain views and then go great. It's time to create a new show           |
| 01:26:28   | note for automators. I'm going to take this template and I'm going to take this data from air table.     |
| 01:26:32   | I'm going to replace these placeholders in the template with this data and bam,                          |
| 01:26:37   | here is a new show document for you. That's one thing I've been tweaking recently because                |
| 01:26:43   | we had an automators document for a long time which had all the data in but it wasn't very pretty.       |
| 01:26:48   | So I got you to work your magic because I've seen your Mac Power users outline                           |
| 01:26:53   | to make it a lot prettier. It's very useful that both of us can go in and edit all of this data          |
| 01:27:02   | in air table and then it just bam magically appears in the Google Doc in a nice formatted view           |
| 01:27:08   | that we can easily share with our guests. Yeah, it's impressive. And organising Google Doc creation      |
| 01:27:16   | it's not really that much work if you want to try and do it. And there's a lot of ways you can do it.    |
| 01:27:21   | Like you mentioned that [[Make]] slash what was it called before [[Make\|Integromat]]. Yeah,                           |
| 01:27:29   | they've got a nice system in there where you can automate the formation of a Google Doc                  |
| 01:27:34   | with a template and that's what you're using for this one, right? Yes, yes, I am. So there's a           |
| 01:27:41   | template document with placeholders in and placeholders are something that you can set up                |
| 01:27:46   | and it's best to check the documents with whichever automation system you want as to how                 |
| 01:27:51   | those need to be formatted. But I just set the placeholders to be different columns from                 |
| 01:27:58   | air table, which puts the data in the right place really, really easily. And there's static              |
| 01:28:08   | information in there that stays the same from show to show. So that just lives in there and it means     |
| 01:28:13   | that if you want to go in and make an edit to the template, you can do it. And the next template         |
| 01:28:17   | that gets created will be correct rather than having a text file which is converted to HTML,             |
| 01:28:23   | which is shoved into Google Docs, which was the kind of hack that I was using before,                    |
| 01:28:27   | which was okay, but it didn't result in very pretty documents.                                           |
| 01:28:30   | Yeah, I've been playing with the same thing for Mac power users and auto-generating the template and     |
| 01:28:34   | this is not rocket science if you want to do it. I guess that kind of gives me a bigger question is      |
| 01:28:40   | what else are you doing with like [[Make\|Make/Integromat]] and [[Zapier]] and some of the other              |
| 01:28:46   | web tools? What's your involvement with those at this point?                                             |
| 01:28:51   | I mean, there's a whole bunch of things happening that I just don't even think about anymore,            |
| 01:28:57   | because, well, magic just happens and projects appear in OmniFocus or documents appear in                |
| 01:29:05   | Finder or DEVONthink or wherever they need to be and I'm not thinking about it, which is really          |
| 01:29:10   | the magic. So I'm just opening [[Make]] right now to just double check because I know I've got a lot         |
| 01:29:15   | of different things in here, which help me keep track of things. One I've recently done is Amazon        |
| 01:29:23   | Returns. If I return something to Amazon, this doesn't happen very often. I try to be smart              |
| 01:29:28   | when I buy something, so I'm not constantly doing returns. It's not great for the environment or         |
| 01:29:33   | anything else, but whenever I do an Amazon return, it grabs that email, that email gets forwarded        |
| 01:29:40   | to it. I use FastMail's rules to forward that to a [[Mailhook\|mailhook]] at [[Make]] and it grabs a bunch of              |
| 01:29:46   | information out of it and adds that as a task or actually a project in [[OmniFocus]]. So I end up with       |
| 01:29:55   | an auto-completing project which will complete with the last item and then inside of it,                 |
| 01:30:02   | it's got print label package item for return and then drop off parcel for return. Only it doesn't        |
| 01:30:08   | just say parcel, it'll actually tell me what the parcel is at all those steps because that               |
| 01:30:13   | information is grabbed out of the email. That has been very useful just because it means that I          |
| 01:30:21   | don't forget and accidentally try and return something too late as very nearly, but fortunately          |
| 01:30:26   | didn't happen before. I thought I had another week to return something and discovered very               |
| 01:30:31   | shortly before the post I was closed that I did not. So fortunately, I was able to make it down          |
| 01:30:35   | there. But what I'm doing with that is I'm just matching text in the email and then I'm calling          |
| 01:30:41   | PushCut and PushCut is adding the [[OmniFocus]] project for me with the information that I need for that.    |
| 01:30:50   | And there's lots of different things that are going on. Whenever I get, there's a tweet about            |
| 01:30:58   | iOS today, I get sent that information in such a way that I can tap on it to retweet and so on           |
| 01:31:06   | and so forth, which I really like. Yeah, I'm trying to use more cloud-based stuff, like                  |
| 01:31:12   | automating the Mac Power users is one that I've been working on lately. What are the                     |
| 01:31:20   | parts of your life you want to automate that you haven't? What are the areas out there?                  |
| 01:31:23   | Where's the blue sky Rose? I mean, laundry, if I could have like a magic machine that just               |
| 01:31:29   | made laundry disappear and then reappear clean, dry, folded and in the drawers or hung up on the         |
| 01:31:35   | hangers, that would be amazing. I did have a very brief Google at one point to see whether or not        |
| 01:31:41   | I could find a machine that would help fold piles of laundry. And the conclusion I came to is they       |
| 01:31:47   | are twice to four times the size of a washing machine, considerably less efficient and very              |
| 01:31:53   | likely to break if they exist. And the only one that I found that seemed to vaguely have information     |
| 01:32:00   | was just, yeah, US only. But there's a lot of things. One of the things that I feel like is              |
| 01:32:07   | totally lacking in automation and really could use it is meal planning and shopping lists from           |
| 01:32:12   | meal planning. Because if I'm going to make spaghetti bolognese, there's a fairly set list               |
| 01:32:18   | of ingredients that I need. And I have briefly started looking into something called Grocy,              |
| 01:32:25   | Grocy, which can help like keep track of what's in your fridge with you and things like that.            |
| 01:32:31   | But I've yet to actually sit down and properly go through and create a list of all the things that       |
| 01:32:36   | I have and start tracking what I'm consuming so that it can add things back to my list when I need       |
| 01:32:41   | to buy them and do meal planning in such a way. And I feel like that's something that's,                 |
| 01:32:47   | once I do it, it'll be, why didn't I do this before? But at the moment, I'm still not there yet.         |
| 01:32:54   | So even Rosemary Orchard has something. She hasn't automated yet.                                        |
| 01:32:59   | Well, if anybody has a complete laundry automation system, then I'm interested. Let me know.             |
| 01:33:05   | Yes, I'm looking for that. Unfortunately, I think the answer to that is either do laundry                |
| 01:33:11   | more frequently. So it's less of a chore or pay somebody else to do my laundry, which they're            |
| 01:33:15   | both valid options. I just need to figure out how much more frequently do I need to do laundry to        |
| 01:33:21   | make this less of a problem. All right. Before we go, we've gone along today. But before we go,          |
| 01:33:26   | let's just take a few minutes to check in on initial impressions of the [[[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]].               |
| 01:33:30   | Like I've just got mine. I just got it installed and set up. I'll tell you a couple of things I          |
| 01:33:37   | like about it. I like that it's cabled, which sounds weird, but I had been trying a [[Bluetooth]]            |
| 01:33:43   | pedal system and it was constantly turning off or not paired and it just wouldn't stay there. So         |
| 01:33:51   | if you tap on the pedal and nothing happens, then you very quickly lose faith in it. So                  |
| 01:33:57   | as much as it is a pain to run a cable up the desk, it's actually nice because it's just always          |
| 01:34:03   | responsive. Another thing I like about it is that it's got different shapes for the pedals. The          |
| 01:34:09   | other mistake with the one I had before was they were all the exact same shape. So I don't know.         |
| 01:34:13   | Oh, right. Yeah. I was referring to it in the MacSparky Labs video as pedal braille,                    |
| 01:34:17   | but I don't know what the word is, but like with your foot, you can tell where you are without           |
| 01:34:21   | looking at it. And that's a nice feature that they've got on the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]]. They also,           |
| 01:34:27   | you know, because it's Elgato, they did a lot of nice little things like they included additional       |
| 01:34:31   | springs. If you want to make them tighter or looser to press, they even put some rubber                  |
| 01:34:36   | things in there where you can literally like turn the middle pedal off. You can put them in there        |
| 01:34:41   | and make it so you can't press it. So if you've resting your foot on it, but I'm not giving up a         |
| 01:34:46   | third button, right? Oh, no, no, no, no, need all the buttons, definitely all the buttons.               |
| 01:34:52   | And then the other thing I like about it is that it's a [[Stream Deck]], right? So all the stuff I'm         |
| 01:34:56   | doing is [[Stream Deck]], keyboard, maestro scripts, whatever I can now stick on my feet. So my initial      |
| 01:35:01   | impression is this is going to be useful for me. I haven't exactly figured out all the ways I'm          |
| 01:35:06   | going to use it, although I have got a mute button now connected to the centre pedal when I podcast,     |
| 01:35:12   | which is nice. Yes. Yeah, I am really, really liking it, especially because I record iOS today           |
| 01:35:19   | live every week. And we display our devices on screen. It's a podcast with video. So we're               |
| 01:35:26   | displaying our devices as we talk. And so switching between just me on camera versus me and an iPhone    |
| 01:35:33   | or an iPad with me overlaid on top of it, that's something I was doing before with the [[Stream Deck]].      |
| 01:35:40   | But I found, and I need to figure out, I'm going to have to pick your brain David,                       |
| 01:35:44   | the correct way to do this, because I find different profiles on the [[Stream Deck]] tend to                 |
| 01:35:50   | point of a better word, bounce back. So it'll be in whatever profile I've selected. So I'll set it       |
| 01:35:57   | to say the automators profile. And then after a little while, I'll glance down on my screen deck         |
| 01:36:02   | and those buttons that I thought were the buttons in the profile. Yeah, they're actually back to my      |
| 01:36:08   | default buttons in my default profile. And I'm not quite sure why that is. I guess it's because          |
| 01:36:14   | the [[Stream Deck]] doesn't anticipate that you're going to spend an hour and a half                         |
| 01:36:18   | still jumping through different applications, but on the same task. And so it bounces you back to        |
| 01:36:23   | your default. And this is the same sort of thing. I've got it a little bit with the pedal as well.       |
| 01:36:28   | So what I'm doing at the moment, which I need to figure out a much better way off is I'm actually        |
| 01:36:33   | going to open up the [[Stream Deck]] preferences, and I changed my default profile for the pedal             |
| 01:36:39   | for each podcast that I do, so that I've got different buttons available to me. And then when            |
| 01:36:44   | I'm not podcasting, I set it back to my actual default default. Because otherwise, I press the           |
| 01:36:51   | foot pedal, and I had this before where I was pressing buttons. Fortunately, they are buttons            |
| 01:36:56   | that are blank on my default profile, but I press it and nothing would happen. And then I glance         |
| 01:37:01   | down at the [[Stream Deck]] and go, oh, that's because there's no button there. And I now have to open       |
| 01:37:05   | the correct profile while I'm podcasting and trying to do all the other things. So I need to             |
| 01:37:10   | figure out why it's bouncing back or just the correct way to solve this problem.                         |
| 01:37:17   | Yeah. I haven't had that problem yet, but I haven't been using it that long.                             |
| 01:37:21   | One big mistake I made was it prompted me and said, do you want to copy your profiles from               |
| 01:37:27   | your [[Stream Deck]] to your... And I just clicked yes without thinking. Well, of course, I have a           |
| 01:37:32   | [[Stream Deck]] with 30 buttons and then a thing with three buttons. That was really dumb to copy            |
| 01:37:37   | those profiles over. So I'm going to delete them all, which you can do. And if you delete them on        |
| 01:37:42   | the panel, it does not delete them for the [[Stream Deck]]. So I'm going to delete them all and start        |
| 01:37:47   | over. But I think there's something to this, and I just have to figure out, like I was playing with      |
| 01:37:53   | in the MacSparky Labs video where I set up the [[Safari]] to move between tabs with the right or left        |
| 01:37:59   | tab on the thing. You could navigate. That doesn't really make sense. I can do that                      |
| 01:38:04   | just as quickly with my fingers. I don't think I need to put that on my foot. And that's really          |
| 01:38:09   | the thing, right? It's like what goes down to the foot and what doesn't. Podcasting, mute the mic,       |
| 01:38:16   | of course. Like the podcast time stamp stuff, of course. I think [[Zoom]] is another great option            |
| 01:38:23   | for this. Wouldn't it be great if you just mash with your foot that it mutes your mic                    |
| 01:38:27   | or changes cameras or whatever. And so there are things where I think we're on camera or                 |
| 01:38:34   | like in the thick of battle, like we, when we're recording a podcast, I think using your foot makes      |
| 01:38:40   | a lot of sense. There's other things I'm not sure it makes as much sense. But honestly, this thing       |
| 01:38:44   | doesn't have to be useful in every context to pay for. It's great. I mean, I think it's just nice to     |
| 01:38:51   | have it. It is really nice to have it. And I have to say, I didn't think I'd get much mileage out of     |
| 01:38:56   | it at work. I'm a developer. I'm a software developer. And I frequently end up sitting in                |
| 01:39:02   | the weirdest positions despite the fact that I've got an air on, which is designed so that it's          |
| 01:39:07   | really difficult to sit badly in this chair. I still somehow manage it. But I found, actually,           |
| 01:39:13   | it has got quite a bit of utility. I'm going into meeting mode, hit the button with my foot. I don't     |
| 01:39:20   | have to reach down and look at the buttons on my [[Stream Deck]] for that because that's                     |
| 01:39:26   | just a bunch of profile that I want to have available at pretty much any moment. Actually,               |
| 01:39:31   | it's a screen sharing one. I think now that I'm thinking about it that I trigger. But it's really        |
| 01:39:36   | useful to be able to do that or just set all my window layouts back to the normal layout                 |
| 01:39:42   | please. You know, I've been shuffling things around and rearranging them for fixing this problem.        |
| 01:39:47   | I'm now starting on a new problem, just reset everything to the way it should be.                        |
| 01:39:51   | And that's been really handy to have just because I actually enjoy having those things                   |
| 01:39:59   | available without having them take up icons on my [[Stream Deck]], which I try to keep                       |
| 01:40:06   | just to the things that I want to be able to reach down and hit a button. But I'm thinking               |
| 01:40:12   | about which button it is when I hit it, whereas the pedals, I don't think I just tap,                    |
| 01:40:17   | which I think is the difference there for me. Yeah. Yeah. It's early. I think we'll talk about this      |
| 01:40:23   | more. I think both of us are going to do a lot of workflows around it. But my initial impression         |
| 01:40:28   | is I am not sending this back. I think it's cool and I'm going to be using it. And I've tried pedals     |
| 01:40:34   | before. They've never worked, but this one already feels like it's a keeper. Yes. The only time that     |
| 01:40:40   | I've had a problem with it, David, I thought it wasn't working the other day and I was very              |
| 01:40:44   | concerned that my streamed out pedal was just like dead or something. It turns out I've been             |
| 01:40:48   | rearranging my desk and I unplugged the cable. So pro tip, if you unplug it, you need to plug it back    |
| 01:40:54   | in again. Yeah. That does help. If it's plugged in, that does help. Yeah. Yeah. It turns out if          |
| 01:40:58   | it's not plugged in, I kind of wish that there was a like easy way to tell by looking at the device      |
| 01:41:03   | from the very least war I've got it, that it's not plugged in. But also if I'd open the streamed         |
| 01:41:08   | axle for a little bit earlier and checked on the pedal, it would have said not connected. Just like      |
| 01:41:14   | it did when I finally opened it and went, oh, that's why. Yeah. That'll do it. That'll do it. I          |
| 01:41:21   | think it's cool. And I just like all the little touches that I'll got those shipping instead of a        |
| 01:41:26   | six foot or five foot cable to 10 foot cable. And because I have a desk that's a sit stand desk,         |
| 01:41:31   | 10 foot is really kind of the minimum length I need to make it. So it will work when the desk            |
| 01:41:37   | is standing mode or sitting mode. But the cable is long enough. It's like, that's cool.                  |
| 01:41:43   | Yes. And it's a braided cable as well. It's not just one of those really, really cheap cables            |
| 01:41:47   | where the coating will fall off the second you look at it. It's a nice braided one.                      |
| 01:41:51   | Yeah. No, I do like the little touches of Elgato stuff. I feel like I'm becoming like                    |
| 01:41:57   | an Elgato fanboy, but they just, they really do good stuff. I heard from a Mac Power users               |
| 01:42:02   | listener that said Elgato was formed by, I think it was the people that did, I want to say the logic.    |
| 01:42:10   | And then they got into hardware and they've got some former Apple people there.                          |
| 01:42:14   | Whatever's going on over there. I'm a fan. I mean, like, like I've got their [[XLR]] box now.                |
| 01:42:19   | I've got their mic stand and man, it's just all good quality stuff that you don't regret buying          |
| 01:42:25   | like so much of the stuff these days. All right. Well, that's it. We are the Automators Podcast.         |

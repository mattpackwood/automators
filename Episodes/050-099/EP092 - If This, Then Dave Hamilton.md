| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:03      | I'm David Sparks,                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:04      | and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                                                              |
| 00:06      | This is the Automators where we talk about how to automate                                                                                                               |
| 00:09      | your technology to do your bidding for you.                                                                                                                              |
| 00:11      | Hello, Rosemary. How are you?                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:13      | Hi, David. I am doing great.                                                                                                                                             |
| 00:15      | We've been having some fun.                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:16      | We have fun with focus modes last time.                                                                                                                                  |
| 00:18      | That was a lot of fun.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:20      | We figured, why not do something different this episode?                                                                                                                 |
| 00:23      | Let's not focus.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:24      | Always focus. We're always focused.                                                                                                                                      |
| 00:27      | In fact, we'll follow up later.                                                                                                                                          |
| 00:29      | You sent me a text message.                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:30      | I want to discuss about triggering focus modes based on location.                                                                                                        |
| 00:34      | But before we do that,                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:36      | I want to introduce our guest today,                                                                                                                                     |
| 00:37      | someone that's been on our list,                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:38      | and we want to thank for coming on the show.                                                                                                                             |

| 00:43      | Hey, thanks for having me.                                                                                                                                               |

| 00:46      | Thank you so much for inviting me along.                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:48      | Dave is one of my favourite nerds.                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:50      | Do you still have that URL?                                                                                                                                              |
| 00:52      | By the way, DaveTheNerd, is that still a thing?                                                                                                                          |
| 00:54      | DaveTheNerd.com, that's in fact a fine way to reach me. Absolutely.                                                                                                      |
| 00:58      | I love that. I love that.                                                                                                                                                |
| 00:59      | But Dave has done all sorts of work in related to the Apple ecosystem.                                                                                                   |
| 01:04      | He makes the very fine podcast.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08      | How long have you guys been doing that now?                                                                                                                              |
| 01:10      | The Mac Geek Gab?                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12      | Mac Geek Gab started, I want to say 17 and a half years ago,                                                                                                              |
| 01:17      | but I might be wrong on that.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18      | 16 and a half, something like that.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:20      | I think it's 16 and a half.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:21      | See, everybody talks about how old Mac Power users is,                                                                                                                   |
| 01:24      | but we're just babies compared to you.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:26      | You've been doing this? 16 and a half, yeah.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:28      | Yeah, that's awesome.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29      | Mac Geek Gab, great podcast.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:31      | You know what it reminds me of?                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:33      | Remember that old show on public radio                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:36      | with the two guys that would fix cars?                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:39      | What was that called?                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:40      | You know what I'm talking about?                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:41      | Car Talk.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:42      | Kids Ask Your Parents.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:43      | It was called Car Talk with click and clack.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:44      | That's right. Yeah, click and clack.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:46      | I feel like you guys are our car talk of the Mac right there.                                                                                                            |
| 01:50      | That is not an inaccurate analog.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:54      | I think that's what we have become in many ways, in fact.                                                                                                                |
| 01:59      | So yeah, we answer people's questions.                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:01      | We love it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:02      | And it gives us new content every week.                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:05      | Yeah, there's no end of questions.                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:08      | And Apple just keeps doing weird things                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:10      | to allow people to have questions.                                                                                                                                       |
| 02:12      | So there you go.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 02:13      | Yeah, and right, the questions are troubleshooting for sure.                                                                                                             |
| 02:16      | But also, hey, how do I make my environment life,                                                                                                                        |
| 02:20      | whatever, better with the technology                                                                                                                                     |
| 02:23      | that I have available to me?                                                                                                                                             |
| 02:24      | Is it possible to do X?                                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:26      | And that actually feeds right into what we're doing here too.                                                                                                            |
| 02:29      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:30      | We're not necessarily solving problems                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:32      | that are technical problems.                                                                                                                                             |
| 02:33      | We are solving life problems with technology.                                                                                                                            |
| 02:36      | Yeah, Dave's also at the Mac Observer                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:38      | and just very active in the community.                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:40      | And I know for a fact, Dave, that you are always building                                                                                                                |
| 02:44      | automations.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 02:45      | In fact, we had Kelly on the show a month or two ago,                                                                                                                    |
| 02:48      | and she was talking about a great [[Keyboard Maestro]] script                                                                                                                |
| 02:51      | that you had written.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:52      | And that was the light bulb moment for me.                                                                                                                               |
| 02:54      | It's like, how have we not have Dave Hamilton on this show yet?                                                                                                          |
| 02:58      | So we immediately got in contact,                                                                                                                                        |
| 02:59      | and you were willing to come on.                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:01      | So thank you so much.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 03:03      | Yeah, my pleasure.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 03:03      | And I noticed, because I can see the in progress agenda,                                                                                                                 |
| 03:07      | show notes document, that you aren't yet                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:09      | using the [[Keyboard Maestro]] automation,                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:11      | because I saw you actually type out the minute and second                                                                                                                |
| 03:15      | mark.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 03:16      | Yes, so there's one small reason why we're not using that.                                                                                                               |
| 03:19      | And that's because it splits the file.                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:22      | And I didn't want to dump like eight hundred files                                                                                                                       |
| 03:25      | on our on our editor, because Jim is wonderful                                                                                                                           |
| 03:28      | and we want to make it so it doesn't it doesn't                                                                                                                          |
| 03:31      | have to split the file because command T splits the file by default.                                                                                                     |
| 03:35      | Yeah, but command T is only used at the start of the show.                                                                                                               |
| 03:40      | And that resets the clock to zero.                                                                                                                                       |
| 03:42      | The because I don't want to split the file either                                                                                                                        |
| 03:44      | when I'm doing like Mac Geek Gab.                                                                                                                                          |
| 03:46      | When we get to a new chapter, the the shortcut,                                                                                                                          |
| 03:49      | the thing that I use and we can put that link back                                                                                                                       |
| 03:51      | in the in the show notes so that people can see it.                                                                                                                      |
| 03:53      | But it's command option control.                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:56      | So those three commands and then the space bar,                                                                                                                          |
| 03:58      | which I can do with one hand.                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:59      | I just roll my finger across it and that drops a timestamp                                                                                                               |
| 04:01      | without doing anything else so it doesn't split the file.                                                                                                                |
| 04:06      | That's it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 04:07      | OK, because I I must have misread it                                                                                                                                     |
| 04:09      | when I was first looking at this then.                                                                                                                                   |
| 04:10      | Sure. Well, no, you're right.                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:11      | Like the command option control command option Z,                                                                                                                        |
| 04:14      | which I do with two hands, you could do with one,                                                                                                                        |
| 04:17      | but I made it a two handed thing                                                                                                                                         |
| 04:18      | so that I don't accidentally do it mid show.                                                                                                                             |
| 04:20      | Although I have done it accidentally,                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:23      | mid show many times, but because I've intentionally                                                                                                                      |
| 04:27      | done it accidentally, but that is the one that splits                                                                                                                    |
| 04:30      | the file and and start of starts things fresh                                                                                                                            |
| 04:32      | and all that good stuff.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 04:33      | So yeah, excellent. Excellent.                                                                                                                                           |
| 04:35      | Well, we started that already nerding out.                                                                                                                               |
| 04:37      | Yeah, exactly. Having fun.                                                                                                                                               |
| 04:39      | It's funny how, you know, the podcasters all like                                                                                                                        |
| 04:43      | end up with certain tools                                                                                                                                                |
| 04:44      | and then the automation tricks get passed around.                                                                                                                        |
| 04:47      | Um, the for so long, you know,                                                                                                                                           |
| 04:50      | we were all doing Skype call recorder and Skype                                                                                                                          |
| 04:52      | and every other Mac podcast was, you know,                                                                                                                               |
| 04:56      | had at least a two minute segment                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:58      | where they complained about Skype.                                                                                                                                       |
| 05:00      | Now it seems like a lot of people are doing it on Zoom.                                                                                                                  |
| 05:03      | So now we have the two minute segment                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:04      | where we complain about Zoom.                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:06      | And either way, we're all coming up                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:08      | with ways to capture timestamps.                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:10      | That's it. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:11      | You want to capture those timestamps                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:12      | because listeners want to be able to jump around.                                                                                                                        |
| 05:14      | I think it's a good thing.                                                                                                                                               |
| 05:15      | Yeah. Do you put chapters in your show?                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:17      | Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, we do.                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:18      | Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. That's good.                                                                                                                                |
| 05:20      | That's the way.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:21      | And it's funny because I get emails from people sometimes                                                                                                                |
| 05:23      | and they're like, Hey, it would be really nice                                                                                                                           |
| 05:25      | if you would put timestamps in the the chapter                                                                                                                           |
| 05:28      | or in the show description                                                                                                                                               |
| 05:31      | so I can just jump to, you know, the the section I want                                                                                                                  |
| 05:34      | or I can skip to it.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:35      | I'm like, I got one better for you.                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:37      | Just click on the chapter.                                                                                                                                               |
| 05:38      | Tap on the chapter. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:40      | You don't need, you don't need to do it yourself.                                                                                                                        |
| 05:41      | We got it covered for you. Right.                                                                                                                                        |
| 05:43      | Though it does require a podcast player to support it.                                                                                                                   |
| 05:45      | But if it doesn't support chapters,                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:47      | then maybe you're missing out on some other amazing features, too.                                                                                                       |
| 05:50      | To be fair, though,                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:51      | Apple's Apple's player did not support it                                                                                                                                |
| 05:55      | until it became podcasts, right?                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:57      | Like for MP3s, especially on the Mac, right?                                                                                                                             |
| 06:00      | It was so it wasn't until we split iTunes on the Mac                                                                                                                     |
| 06:03      | into music podcasts, etc.                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:05      | that we had MP3 support for chapters on the Mac                                                                                                                          |
| 06:08      | because iTunes only had it for AAC files,                                                                                                                                |
| 06:10      | but we are nerding out here.                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:12      | Dave, where do you listen to podcasts?                                                                                                                                   |
| 06:14      | I use Overcast, Marco Arment's player.                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:16      | Yeah. That seems to be the one everybody uses.                                                                                                                           |
| 06:19      | You too, Rose?                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:20      | Well, he went nuts.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:21      | I mean, he created that audio playback engine                                                                                                                            |
| 06:24      | that auto normalises the sound on the fly                                                                                                                                |
| 06:29      | and it does a fantastic job.                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:31      | Yeah, it is really good.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:32      | The smart speed and then of course, on top of that,                                                                                                                      |
| 06:35      | it's got the ability to strip silence, essentially.                                                                                                                      |
| 06:39      | So if there's a long pause of dead air,                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:41      | it's just going to cut that out                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:42      | so you don't even realise it,                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:44      | which is great for some of the shows who are just starting out,                                                                                                          |
| 06:47      | who haven't figured out quite, you know,                                                                                                                                 |
| 06:49      | how much of what they need to remove yet.                                                                                                                                |
| 06:51      | It means that I get a really consistent listening experience everywhere.                                                                                                 |
| 06:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:54      | Yeah, you're right.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:55      | It makes the listening experience consistent                                                                                                                             |
| 06:57      | in a lot of different ways.                                                                                                                                              |
| 06:58      | Yeah, and you become spoiled real fast.                                                                                                                                  |
| 07:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:02      | So, yeah. No, it's good.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:03      | Yeah, and of course, Dave, also for those who don't know him,                                                                                                            |

| 07:07      | Like he's a drummer, an amazing drummer.                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:10      | He used to play with the...                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:12      | Was it the Mac World All-Star Band?                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:14      | That was fun.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 07:15      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:16      | He used to do that.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 07:17      | And you're also always doing cool stuff with audio.                                                                                                                      |
| 07:19      | Whenever I need to get a new mic or something,                                                                                                                           |
| 07:21      | I have to check in and get a blessing from Mr. Hamilton.                                                                                                                 |
| 07:25      | Well, yeah, I'm picky about audio.                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:29      | And I suppose, at times, that's a good thing.                                                                                                                            |
| 07:32      | It depends on who you are in my life,                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:34      | whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.                                                                                                                                |
| 07:36      | Yes, I'm sure some people will go,                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:38      | it's better that much, does it?                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:40      | But if you enjoy listening to a podcast,                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:42      | I've heard before.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:43      | Yeah, it can definitely improve things                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:45      | if you've got good audio.                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:47      | People don't notice good audio,                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:48      | but they are very aware of bad audio.                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:50      | Dave, how'd you get started in automation?                                                                                                                               |
| 07:53      | I have been a nerd for a very long time.                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:56      | And when I got my first computer,                                                                                                                                        |
| 08:00      | well, I guess my first computer was a Timex Sinclair.                                                                                                                    |
| 08:04      | And I did some programming on that.                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:07      | Oh, man, I am so tempted to go down that rabbit hole with you.                                                                                                           |
| 08:12      | Did you get the thermal printer?                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:14      | Did you get the thermal printer?                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:15      | I did not have the thermal printer.                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:17      | It's like $200, right?                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:19      | Something like that?                                                                                                                                                     |
| 08:20      | No, it was exorbitantly expensive at the time,                                                                                                                           |
| 08:22      | especially for our family.                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:24      | And now you can buy a cheap little Bluetooth receipt printer                                                                                                             |
| 08:26      | from Aliexpress for like $20.                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:28      | No, no, the Timex Sinclair was like $200.                                                                                                                                |
| 08:31      | And it had 4K or something.                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:33      | I wanted one so badly.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:35      | My parents would not buy it for me.                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:37      | I was sad.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:38      | Yeah, we were very fortunate.                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:40      | It was given to us by my godfather,                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:42      | my dad's old college roommate.                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:44      | And so that was, it was awesome.                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:46      | And then, you know, I programmed on like Commodore Pets                                                                                                                  |

| 08:52      | And then our first Not Timex Sinclair computer at home                                                                                                                   |
| 08:56      | was an Apple 2C.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 08:58      | And so, you know, programming,                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:00      | programming back then was one of the primary ways                                                                                                                        |
| 09:05      | that you would interact with your computer.                                                                                                                              |
| 09:08      | If you were interested in using your computer,                                                                                                                           |
| 09:11      | oftentimes it meant teaching it how to do things, right?                                                                                                                 |
| 09:17      | There were programs, we didn't call them apps,                                                                                                                           |
| 09:20      | but you know, the same thing.                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:21      | There were apps back then that you could buy                                                                                                                             |
| 09:23      | or trade with friends or whatever.                                                                                                                                       |
| 09:25      | There was no downloading.                                                                                                                                                |
| 09:26      | It's not in the beginning.                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:28      | And so to interact with the computer,                                                                                                                                    |
| 09:31      | it was making it do things, which is automation.                                                                                                                         |
| 09:34      | It, you know, sort of at its core.                                                                                                                                       |
| 09:36      | I mean, some things were more automated than others.                                                                                                                     |
| 09:38      | And now automation means a very specific thing.                                                                                                                          |
| 09:40      | But it, you know, it is all sort of thinking about                                                                                                                       |
| 09:43      | what can I, what, how do I tell my computer device                                                                                                                       |
| 09:47      | and now the cloud to do this thing for me that I want done?                                                                                                              |
| 09:52      | And so that's where that started.                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:55      | And then it, you know, it just evolves.                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:57      | We have these tools with us now in our pockets, on our wrists,                                                                                                           |
| 10:01      | et cetera, et cetera.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10:03      | And they can do all of these great things.                                                                                                                               |
| 10:06      | And like the cloud is one of the best things                                                                                                                             |
| 10:08      | that happen to automation or perhaps automation                                                                                                                          |
| 10:10      | is one of the best uses of the cloud or others.                                                                                                                          |
| 10:13      | But having an always on computer that can do things for you                                                                                                              |
| 10:19      | and watch things for you and make things happen for you                                                                                                                  |
| 10:22      | is spectacular.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:24      | And in fact, for prepping for this show,                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:26      | I realised just how many automations I have running                                                                                                                      |
| 10:30      | that I have completely forgotten about                                                                                                                                   |
| 10:32      | because they just run and do their thing                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:34      | and they don't have any problems and it's amazing.                                                                                                                       |
| 10:37      | And that, you know, that's so, I don't know,                                                                                                                             |
| 10:40      | I don't know if that got way outside the bounds                                                                                                                          |
| 10:42      | of your question, but that's how I got started                                                                                                                           |
| 10:44      | and that's where I am now, yeah.                                                                                                                                         |
| 10:45      | I remember Wozniak saying at one point                                                                                                                                   |
| 10:47      | that he thought that the original Apple II, you know,                                                                                                                    |
| 10:50      | the idea was the people who bought it                                                                                                                                    |
| 10:52      | would write their programs for it, you know.                                                                                                                             |
| 10:55      | The idea of selling pre-written software                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:59      | really wasn't on his radar.                                                                                                                                              |
| 11:01      | And I remember, I don't know.                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:04      | Did you ever, I mean, were you, I mean,                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:06      | you do have the domain Dave the nerd,                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:08      | so I have to assume you played Dungeons & Dragons                                                                                                                        |
| 11:10      | at some point in your childhood.                                                                                                                                         |
| 11:12      | Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.                                                                                                                                               |
| 11:14      | Yeah, and then played all the ultimate games                                                                                                                             |
| 11:16      | on the computer too and all that stuff.                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:18      | But yes, Dungeons and Dragons was huge.                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:20      | So you had the little bag of dice, right?                                                                                                                                |
| 11:21      | You know, you had that goofy four-sided die                                                                                                                              |
| 11:23      | that never really worked and like the 30-sided.                                                                                                                          |
| 11:26      | And for me, when I showed up for Dungeons & Dragons,                                                                                                                     |
| 11:29      | I had written my own dice application on my Atari 400.                                                                                                                   |
| 11:36      | So instead of bringing a little bag of dice                                                                                                                              |
| 11:38      | to Dungeons & Dragons, I would bring a TV                                                                                                                                |
| 11:41      | and an Atari 400 because in my mind,                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:43      | that made so much more sense.                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:45      | Yeah, no, that's more efficient, isn't it?                                                                                                                               |
| 11:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:49      | So what you two are saying is both of you                                                                                                                                |
| 11:51      | are incredibly similar to James Thompson,                                                                                                                                |
| 11:53      | except you didn't quite go to the part of embedding                                                                                                                      |
| 11:55      | like tiny little dragons inside of some of your dice.                                                                                                                    |
| 11:58      | Yeah, no, I would have, man, I would have lost my mind                                                                                                                   |
| 12:02      | if I had saw James Thompson's dice hat when I was a kid.                                                                                                                 |
| 12:05      | But either way, you're right.                                                                                                                                            |
| 12:07      | I mean, I think computers started out encouraging automation,                                                                                                            |
| 12:11      | but then we kind of, we do have a thing now                                                                                                                              |
| 12:14      | where a lot of software is written for you                                                                                                                               |
| 12:16      | and a lot of people use computers                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:19      | without considering automation.                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:21      | And that's really the reason we make this show                                                                                                                           |
| 12:23      | is I want people listening to understand                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:25      | that you do not need to program an app to automate.                                                                                                                      |
| 12:30      | Now, things work much simpler                                                                                                                                            |
| 12:32      | and a lot of people can do it.                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:34      | And I love the idea, Dave, of you discovering                                                                                                                            |
| 12:37      | forgotten automations because they're just working                                                                                                                       |
| 12:39      | because isn't that the best kind of automation?                                                                                                                          |
| 12:42      | That's how it should be.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:43      | That's exactly it.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12:44      | Yeah, it is.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12:45      | You put in the work and hopefully,                                                                                                                                       |
| 12:47      | I mean, depending on what the automation is,                                                                                                                             |
| 12:49      | you know, the complexity of it might be a lot of work.                                                                                                                   |
| 12:51      | It might just be a little bit of work,                                                                                                                                   |
| 12:53      | but you put in the work for something to happen                                                                                                                          |
| 12:55      | and then it starts happening                                                                                                                                             |
| 12:58      | and then you move on to the next thing.                                                                                                                                  |
| 13:00      | That's the point of automation is it just happens.                                                                                                                       |
| 13:03      | One of, this is going to sound ridiculous,                                                                                                                               |
| 13:06      | but I'll say it because it's true.                                                                                                                                       |
| 13:08      | One of the most profound uses of smart home technology for me                                                                                                            |
| 13:16      | was when I got smart outdoor lights                                                                                                                                      |
| 13:21      | and then was able to automate.                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:24      | We use the Amazon A lady.                                                                                                                                                |
| 13:26      | I don't know what you like to say here on that show about her                                                                                                            |
| 13:28      | so that you don't trigger everybody's devices,                                                                                                                           |
| 13:31      | but we use the Amazon A lady as our smart home                                                                                                                           |
| 13:36      | sort of foundation, if you will,                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:38      | but you could use, you know, [[HomeKit]] in Siri                                                                                                                            |
| 13:40      | and Google one and all the others.                                                                                                                                       |
| 13:42      | But the simple little automation of at sundown                                                                                                                           |
| 13:47      | turn on the outdoor lights                                                                                                                                               |
| 13:49      | and at midnight turn off my outdoor lights.                                                                                                                              |
| 13:52      | These are simple automations doable                                                                                                                                      |
| 13:54      | in any of your smart home platforms.                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:56      | You could even do it with if that was life changing for me.                                                                                                              |
| 14:00      | It's like, oh, like,                                                                                                                                                     |
| 14:02      | I never stopped to think about how much mental energy                                                                                                                    |
| 14:06      | I put in every day into,                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:08      | oh, remember to turn on the outdoor lights.                                                                                                                              |
| 14:10      | I don't know if it's dark out now or coming home                                                                                                                         |
| 14:12      | after it got dark out.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:14      | And of course your driveway is dark                                                                                                                                      |
| 14:15      | because there's no outdoor lights on yet.                                                                                                                                |
| 14:17      | And then remembering at night, oh, hey, did you turn the lights off?                                                                                                     |
| 14:19      | Yeah, okay.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 14:20      | You know, it's this thing.                                                                                                                                               |
| 14:21      | It's super simple.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:22      | It like, there are worse problems to have in life                                                                                                                        |
| 14:25      | than having to worry about when to turn on and off your lights.                                                                                                          |
| 14:28      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:29      | I'll acknowledge that.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:30      | But it is profound to offload that                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:33      | and never think about it again.                                                                                                                                          |
| 14:36      | And that was what sold me on having lights.                                                                                                                              |
| 14:38      | Yeah, and the advantage is it adjusts to when sunset is.                                                                                                                 |
| 14:42      | I mean, it allows you to avoid the home alone problem, you know.                                                                                                         |
| 14:45      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:46      | Where the guy in the van sits there and looks at his watch                                                                                                               |
| 14:49      | and watches all of the lights turn on automatically at 5 p.m.                                                                                                            |
| 14:52      | And with the sunset, you know,                                                                                                                                           |
| 14:55      | whether you run it in summer or winter,                                                                                                                                  |
| 14:57      | it just turns them on when it gets dark.                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:59      | That's it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:02      | Or like simple things like you get home                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:04      | and your lights turn on automatically.                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:06      | So you're never again walking into a dark house or a dark room.                                                                                                          |
| 15:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:10      | Like you just know that the lights are on and everything.                                                                                                                |
| 15:12      | And that is, you know, that is something that is,                                                                                                                        |
| 15:15      | it doesn't seem like a lot.                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:17      | But when you realise, you know,                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:19      | when, for example, I went on holiday this year                                                                                                                           |
| 15:21      | and I came home and electricity was out.                                                                                                                                |
| 15:23      | It turned off for some reason.                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:26      | I had to empty the contents in my freezer,                                                                                                                               |
| 15:28      | which was less than pleasant at 10 p.m.                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:30      | But I came home and everything was dark.                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:32      | And it's like, oh gosh, what do I do now?                                                                                                                                |
| 15:35      | Like, you know, it's dark.                                                                                                                                               |
| 15:36      | I don't usually have this problem.                                                                                                                                       |
| 15:38      | Like this is not usually a me problem.                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:40      | And it was very, one of those moments where it's like,                                                                                                                   |
| 15:43      | oh, wow, I really do appreciate the,                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:46      | like being able to offload that.                                                                                                                                         |
| 15:48      | And it just works because you're coming in,                                                                                                                              |
| 15:50      | your hands are filled with bags or you just, you know,                                                                                                                   |
| 15:52      | you've just driven in and it's freezing outside or something.                                                                                                            |
| 15:54      | You don't want to be, you know, fumbling around,                                                                                                                         |
| 15:56      | pulling off gloves to turn on lights before you can see anything.                                                                                                        |
| 15:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:59      | It makes a big difference.                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:01      | Now I say that that's a simple automation.                                                                                                                               |
| 16:02      | And it is for anyone, any one of us certainly doing the show,                                                                                                            |
| 16:05      | anybody listening, the tools are all in place to make that a one step thing.                                                                                             |
| 16:10      | You say, if, you know, time is sunset, then turn on my lights.                                                                                                           |
| 16:15      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:16      | And if time is midnight, then turn off my lights or, you know,                                                                                                           |
| 16:18      | however you want to set it for your house.                                                                                                                               |
| 16:19      | Super simple.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:20      | But it is fairly complex.                                                                                                                                                |
| 16:22      | What's happening behind the scenes to make that happen.                                                                                                                  |
| 16:25      | It's just, we don't have to program it from scratch anymore.                                                                                                             |
| 16:28      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:29      | Cause we have all these tools.                                                                                                                                           |
| 16:30      | And that is really where the power comes in is,                                                                                                                          |
| 16:34      | is leverageing these things that are at least somewhat common needs                                                                                                       |
| 16:39      | of everyone so that it's just there and you just sort of select                                                                                                          |
| 16:43      | and you don't even have to understand what programming is.                                                                                                               |
| 16:46      | Although what we're discussing here is, I would call this programming.                                                                                                   |
| 16:50      | I mean, it's a, it's a different type of language than say programming                                                                                                   |
| 16:53      | in basic or C or, you know, any of those others,                                                                                                                         |
| 16:56      | but you are programming a system to do a thing that you get to choose                                                                                                    |
| 17:00      | how it works.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17:01      | That's programming.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 17:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17:03      | Dave, while we're on the subject, where else have you drank from the cup                                                                                                 |
| 17:06      | of home automation?                                                                                                                                                      |
| 17:07      | I have to imagine you've gone deeper.                                                                                                                                    |
| 17:09      | Oh, for sure.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 17:12      | So I mean, we, you know, we have ring cameras and various other cameras                                                                                                  |
| 17:15      | outside.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:16      | Um, I, you know, I, because I'm a nerd and I do Mac Geek Gab, I've had,                                                                                                    |
| 17:22      | I started getting into home automation well before Apple ever even began                                                                                                 |
| 17:27      | with home kit and then certainly ever got to a point where home kit                                                                                                      |
| 17:31      | was actually feasible for most people to use with the devices that they had.                                                                                             |
| 17:36      | Apple sort of screwed up that entry, but that's fine.                                                                                                                    |
| 17:39      | So I have devices that work with all different platforms,                                                                                                                |
| 17:43      | most of which are not home kit.                                                                                                                                          |
| 17:45      | So I also run.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 17:47      | Um, it's a flavour of Homebridge called hooves just cause it has a                                                                                                       |
| 17:53      | simple interface.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 17:54      | But what it does is it, it runs on a computer in my house.                                                                                                               |
| 17:57      | For me, it happens to be a, a Synology disk station, but it could                                                                                                        |
| 18:01      | be a Mac mini or a Raspberry Pi.                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:03      | It doesn't really matter.                                                                                                                                                |
| 18:04      | But what hooves and or Homebridge do is link all of my smart home                                                                                                       |
| 18:09      | devices into home kit.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:11      | So I can see all of my cameras in one app, the home app, even if                                                                                                         |
| 18:16      | they're not home kit cameras, and I can control most of my devices                                                                                                       |
| 18:19      | from that app, which is just makes it easier for the whole family to do                                                                                                  |
| 18:22      | it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:23      | So, so that's sort of the, but like I said, art, I don't really have                                                                                                     |
| 18:28      | home kit doing automations for me simply because we had previously                                                                                                       |
| 18:32      | standardised on the Amazon a lady and that that's been fine.                                                                                                             |
| 18:36      | I don't have any reason to switch.                                                                                                                                       |
| 18:38      | You know, I'm despite being a nerd who lives, who's, who often lives by,                                                                                                 |
| 18:44      | you know, if it ain't broke, fix it till it is with my home kit stuff.                                                                                                   |
| 18:48      | I do sort of my home automation stuff.                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:50      | I do sort of follow if it ain't broke, don't fix it.                                                                                                                     |
| 18:53      | Yeah, that is one of those things.                                                                                                                                       |
| 18:55      | So frustrating when you go to turn on the light and the light doesn't turn                                                                                               |
| 18:58      | on and then you spend 45 minutes debugging your motion sensors and                                                                                                       |
| 19:01      | everything only to find out somebody flipped the switch.                                                                                                                 |
| 19:03      | That's it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 19:04      | Yeah, it sucks.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:05      | But I do things like, you know, like when watching TV in the living                                                                                                      |
| 19:08      | room, I have all smart lights in the living room now.                                                                                                                    |
| 19:10      | And so I can say, you know, a lady dim living room and it, it turns off                                                                                                  |
| 19:15      | one light, it dims two others and it sets two others to red because                                                                                                      |
| 19:19      | they're between, they're in their field of view between us and the TV.                                                                                                   |
| 19:22      | And by having them go from yellow to red, they become invisible and yet                                                                                                  |
| 19:27      | are still providing light in the room, which is really kind of a nice thing.                                                                                             |
| 19:30      | So, you know, we do that and I have the ability to pause and resume the TV                                                                                               |
| 19:34      | just by telling the a lady to do that.                                                                                                                                   |
| 19:37      | And I also have it announced when it's, when I see when it detects                                                                                                       |
| 19:41      | motion in my driveway with the way our house is set up.                                                                                                                  |
| 19:44      | If we're sitting in the living room, it's clear on the other side of the house                                                                                           |
| 19:47      | in the driveway and it's just kind of nice to know that, oh, hey, there's,                                                                                               |
| 19:49      | you know, a human in the driveway.                                                                                                                                       |
| 19:51      | It's like, oh, yeah, let's, let's go check that out or not.                                                                                                              |
| 19:53      | You know, it's like, oh, yeah, we're expecting someone.                                                                                                                  |
| 19:55      | That's fine.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:56      | So I think, I think that's the extent of my home, my smart home stuff.                                                                                                   |
| 20:00      | Have you played with Homebridge recently because I know Homebridge                                                                                                       |
| 20:03      | didn't used to have a pretty user interface, but it actually does now.                                                                                                   |
| 20:07      | And it's a lot simpler to use than it previously was with editing the [[YAML]] file                                                                                          |
| 20:10      | or the JSON file in the back end for the configuration.                                                                                                                  |
| 20:13      | I switched from Homebridge to HOOBS because of that.                                                                                                                    |
| 20:18      | And at the time that I made the switch, Homebridge did then have the new,                                                                                                |
| 20:23      | you know, graphical interface and all that.                                                                                                                              |
| 20:26      | But it, regardless of which path I chose moving to Homebridge with a GUI                                                                                                 |
| 20:31      | or HOOBS with a GUI, I was going to have to rebuild everything.                                                                                                         |
| 20:35      | And so it was like, well, I've heard more about HOOBS.                                                                                                                  |
| 20:39      | And so I'm going to take, that's the path I'm going to choose.                                                                                                           |
| 20:43      | It seemed to be a little more, quite frankly, a little more idiot-proof.                                                                                                 |
| 20:47      | And again, despite the fact that I'm a nerd, it's like, yeah,                                                                                                            |
| 20:51      | I'm going to go with the one that generally accepted to be the one that works.                                                                                           |
| 20:55      | And HOOBS does have like certified HOOBS plugins for various devices,                                                                                                  |
| 21:00      | which I've found, it works for me.                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:03      | And so that I guess is, and I get to forget about it most of the time, which is the key.                                                                                 |
| 21:08      | That's what you want.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:09      | You don't want to be managing all these things and micro managing them.                                                                                                  |
| 21:12      | That's terrible.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:13      | And it's not perfect.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:14      | Like if I remove a device from my smart home, HOOBS will not forget about it ever, ever.                                                                                |
| 21:20      | And so that's a little frustrating to have to sort of manage those                                                                                                       |
| 21:23      | and put them in like, you know, Siberia rooms so that they aren't showing up on things.                                                                                  |
| 21:29      | But it's fine.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:30      | Like I don't, they say that the next version of HOOBS will help address that.                                                                                           |
| 21:34      | I'm sure it will mean wiping the slate clean and starting from scratch again.                                                                                            |
| 21:38      | So I'm in no rush.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:40      | I know how to put things in Siberia.                                                                                                                                     |
| 21:41      | It's fine.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 21:42      | I do think though, with home automation as automators, the challenge we all face is                                                                                      |
| 21:47      | this is one where there's no room for error.                                                                                                                             |
| 21:50      | Like when you're building a shortcut or a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script, it's for you.                                                                                         |
| 21:54      | And if it breaks, you can fix it and you know what's going on.                                                                                                           |
| 21:58      | Whereas with home automation stuff, when you live with other humans,                                                                                                     |
| 22:02      | they don't know about HOOBS, right?                                                                                                                                     |
| 22:04      | They don't, they don't want to know about that stuff.                                                                                                                    |
| 22:07      | They just want to know that if they push the button, the light goes on.                                                                                                  |
| 22:10      | And it's really informed me because of my first attempts at this,                                                                                                        |
| 22:15      | we're like using some of the hue light bulbs.                                                                                                                            |
| 22:17      | And then of course they would turn the switches off and the light bulbs wouldn't work anymore.                                                                           |
| 22:21      | And, and, or I tell them, oh, to turn the light on, you need to pull your phone out and push a button.                                                                   |
| 22:26      | And they're like, that's not the way I want to turn a light on, you know.                                                                                                |
| 22:30      | And so, so I've really kind of over the years got really good about any home                                                                                             |
| 22:36      | automation stuff I bring in, making sure there's like an analog method.                                                                                                  |
| 22:40      | Like I'm really a big fan of the, the switches, you know, where you put the switches in.                                                                                 |
| 22:45      | I use the, why am I forgetting the new...                                                                                                                                |
| 22:49      | Lutron Casetaa.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 22:50      | Yes, Lutron Casetaa.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:51      | I use the Lutron Casetaa switches.                                                                                                                                      |
| 22:53      | So they can still hit the switch on the wall and lights go off and on,                                                                                                   |
| 22:56      | but I can still control them as well.                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:58      | And, you know, same thing, we did a front door lock and I got one that has a key in it                                                                                   |
| 23:03      | and they can use the key to unlock the door, but I can use automation to unlock the door.                                                                                |
| 23:08      | So that's always been...                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:09      | No, that's, that's important.                                                                                                                                            |
| 23:11      | I agree with that.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23:13      | And also a fallback when it goes wrong, because let's face it,                                                                                                           |
| 23:16      | something's going to go wrong at some point and being able to get up and just press a button,                                                                            |
| 23:19      | have the light turn on is, is a pretty decent alternative.                                                                                                               |
| 23:22      | In my house, it's a necessary alternative because the last thing I want is the phone call                                                                                |
| 23:29      | that is now the most urgent thing in the world of I can't get the lights to turn on in the living room.                                                                  |
| 23:36      | Like that's not okay.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23:38      | And, you know, and it's not the most urgent thing in the world, but it sure is in that moment.                                                                           |
| 23:43      | I've got to, I've got glaucoma, so I have to take all these eye drops every night.                                                                                       |
| 23:48      | I've been like 20 minutes with my eyes closed every night before I could have bed and Daisy was downstairs                                                               |
| 23:53      | and I have a switch in the side table.                                                                                                                                   |
| 23:56      | I have a couple of them that turn the lights off and on in the bedroom and one that's kind of like the emergency switch                                                  |
| 24:02      | that if you turn it, it turns all the lights on downstairs.                                                                                                              |
| 24:06      | Like, you know, you wake up in the light, you hear a noise, I press that button.                                                                                         |
| 24:10      | But like an idiot, I also made it so if you long press it, it turns all the lights off downstairs                                                                        |
| 24:16      | thinking, well, when I come back upstairs after checking things out, I'll want to turn them off.                                                                         |
| 24:21      | But I use the same gesture on the other button to turn off the lights in the bedroom when I'm putting these drops in.                                                    |
| 24:27      | So long story short, I pushed the wrong one the other night and my wife was downstairs wrapping presents                                                                 |
| 24:33      | and all I heard was, hey, it's really dark down here.                                                                                                                    |
| 24:39      | Okay, so I have a tip for you there, David.                                                                                                                              |
| 24:42      | Velcro sticky dots, Velcro sticky dots stick them to the side of the drawer.                                                                                             |
| 24:45      | Do you not put them in the drawer but stick them to the side of the drawer?                                                                                              |
| 24:48      | I have a cupboard next to my bed with like doors open and I have stuck buttons on the inside of those doors                                                              |
| 24:54      | because this way they're not on a shelf where I can accidentally put something on them and press them or something.                                                      |
| 24:58      | I have to like try to press them when I'm trying to do it.                                                                                                               |
| 25:02      | Velcro sticky dots, the rescue.                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:03      | I'm using those flick switches, the FLIC, they're great and they do stick to the side.                                                                                   |
| 25:09      | I just pushed the wrong one like a bozo and put my wife in complete darkness and that was great.                                                                         |
| 25:16      | That was great.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:17      | That's great.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 25:18      | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:19      | Well, and that's the problem with this is you can outsmart yourself with these things.                                                                                   |
| 25:23      | Yeah, and you will learn that and then undo it.                                                                                                                          |
| 25:28      | That's fine.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 25:29      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 25:30      | So, yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:31      | Dave, I know you are always coming up with cool automations and you were telling me when they solved a little problem that all of us have.                               |
| 25:38      | In fact, as soon as you told me about this, I immediately set it up for myself.                                                                                          |
| 25:42      | Tell me about your driveway Wi-Fi.                                                                                                                                       |
| 25:44      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:45      | Well, you know, Wi-Fi often is spotty in the driveway, especially as you get to the edge of the driveway.                                                                |
| 25:51      | And when that is most annoying is when I am in my car and it's trying to figure out how to finish setting up the map for wherever I'm going, right?                      |
| 26:04      | It starts out on Wi-Fi because it's maybe in the garage, maybe in the garage, I get a good signal.                                                                       |
| 26:09      | And then by the time I get to the end of the driveway, you know, I found myself waiting in the garage until the phone would tell me, okay, I'm good.                     |
| 26:17      | And then I would leave and this is ridiculous.                                                                                                                           |
| 26:20      | I would also have a problem where stopped at traffic lights.                                                                                                             |
| 26:23      | My phone would try to connect to the, you know, the Xfinity Wi-Fi when I was an Xfinity customer of whatever business or house was like right next to the traffic light. |
| 26:32      | So I've solved this.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:34      | I have two automations that I use in the shortcuts app.                                                                                                                  |
| 26:39      | And one of them is when CarPlay connects, set Wi-Fi off.                                                                                                                 |
| 26:46      | Yeah, it's a simple trigger, you know, connected.                                                                                                                        |
| 26:49      | It's a simple trigger.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 26:50      | So when CarPlay connects, but you could do it when you connect to Bluetooth, I think.                                                                                    |
| 26:54      | Bluetooth would require confirmation, I think.                                                                                                                           |
| 26:57      | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:58      | That's the problem with Bluetooth is it requires confirmation.                                                                                                           |
| 27:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:02      | But with CarPlay because you're, and I don't know, I don't have wireless CarPlay in my car, but I rented a car with wireless CarPlay a couple of months ago.             |
| 27:13      | And I think this automation worked with CarPlay regardless of whether it was wired or wireless.                                                                          |
| 27:19      | But yeah, the when of the automation is when CarPlay connects and the do is set Wi-Fi, turn Wi-Fi off.                                                                   |
| 27:28      | And then the flip side, the second one is when CarPlay disconnects, set Wi-Fi, turn Wi-Fi on.                                                                            |
| 27:35      | And it's fantastic because as soon as I plug into CarPlay, my Wi-Fi is off.                                                                                              |
| 27:40      | Now I am on whatever cellular network I'm on and hopefully it works and, you know, I have data.                                                                          |
| 27:47      | But that way, leaving the driveway, I choose when the transition happens as opposed to the phone trying to outsmart itself                                               |
| 27:54      | and try to hang on to that Wi-Fi that it really shouldn't be trying to hang on to.                                                                                       |
| 27:59      | So yeah, no, it's one of my favourite ones.                                                                                                                               |
| 28:02      | It's super simple.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:03      | And David, your reaction to it is the same as most people that I tell as soon as they hear about it.                                                                     |
| 28:09      | Like, they completely understand it and they have to go implement it.                                                                                                    |
| 28:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:16      | I put it on because I'm always like setting a destination in the driveway and I'm just close enough to my Wi-Fi                                                          |
| 28:23      | to have a bad signal, you know.                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:26      | But as soon as you're off the Wi-Fi, then everything works great.                                                                                                        |
| 28:30      | So I hooked it up on mine that I told Daisy about it and then she wanted it.                                                                                             |
| 28:34      | So I put a shortcut on her phone too.                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:36      | And it's just a great idea.                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:39      | And that's one of the things I love about it is it's such a simple automation.                                                                                           |
| 28:42      | It's two steps, you know.                                                                                                                                                |
| 28:44      | One is a trigger.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 28:45      | Am I connecting or disconnecting from CarPlay?                                                                                                                           |
| 28:49      | And the second one is turn Wi-Fi on or turn it off.                                                                                                                      |
| 28:53      | I mean, it's so easy.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:54      | Super easy.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:55      | The only thing I'll say is if you've got wireless CarPlay, it uses Wi-Fi to connect.                                                                                     |
| 28:59      | Good point is you couldn't do this, right?                                                                                                                               |
| 29:02      | I have a CarPlay adapter for my car.                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:05      | So it makes it into wireless CarPlay.                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:07      | And what it does for me automatically is it disables the Wi-Fi when it sorted itself out,                                                                                |
| 29:12      | but it is using the Wi-Fi to do that.                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:15      | So that is something to bear in mind.                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:18      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:19      | Of course it's using Wi-Fi to do wireless CarPlay because it has to.                                                                                                     |
| 29:22      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:24      | But I can't plug into my CarPlay unit.                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:26      | I just, a lot of the time, if I'm going on a really short journey, I really don't want to plug my phone in.                                                              |
| 29:32      | Like I'd rather just leave it in my bag.                                                                                                                                 |
| 29:34      | So yeah, I got a CarPlay adapter.                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:37      | It's the CarPlay to Air.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 29:39      | I'll put a link in the show notes for anybody who's interested.                                                                                                          |
| 29:41      | And it works pretty well for me.                                                                                                                                         |
| 29:43      | Yeah, it's one of those where you don't realise that, of course, it's using Wi-Fi until you realise, of course, it's using Wi-Fi to do this.                             |
| 29:52      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:53      | Of course, it's using Wi-Fi.                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:54      | But it's like [[AirPlay]], right?                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:55      | It's using a combination of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to set everything up and know where everything is and so on and so forth.                                                |
| 30:00      | And then it gets sorted out and it's pretty instant and stuff.                                                                                                           |
| 30:04      | But it disables the Wi-Fi because when my phone is connected to my car,                                                                                                  |
| 30:08      | if I swipe down into the control centre, obviously, while the car is parked in safe place, then the Wi-Fi logo is actually white,                                        |
| 30:15      | just like you would expect it to be if it's disabled.                                                                                                                    |
| 30:19      | You know, I know that it's inevitable that CarPlay is going to only be Wi-Fi, but I actually really like the cable.                                                      |
| 30:27      | You know, it's just kind of a nice ritual.                                                                                                                               |
| 30:29      | You plug your phone in.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:30      | And in my case, I've got one of those little things under your right arm where you can lift it up.                                                                       |
| 30:35      | Like a little cabin thing with a lid on it.                                                                                                                              |
| 30:38      | And that's where the plug is.                                                                                                                                            |
| 30:39      | So I just drop the phone in there, shut the lid.                                                                                                                         |
| 30:41      | Then there's no way I'm going to be goofing off with my phone while I'm driving.                                                                                         |
| 30:45      | And the phone gets a nice charge.                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:47      | And, you know, I really kind of like the existing system.                                                                                                                |
| 30:51      | But yeah, I guess at some point.                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:53      | How often does your CarPlay cable flake out on you?                                                                                                                      |
| 30:56      | Because I lose them about once every six months.                                                                                                                         |
| 30:59      | And so I have to keep a spare cable in the car.                                                                                                                          |
| 31:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:02      | It's interesting.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31:03      | It's relative to how much time my wife and kids spend in my car.                                                                                                         |
| 31:09      | Because they're monsters when it comes to cables.                                                                                                                        |
| 31:12      | They have no respect for them whatsoever.                                                                                                                                |
| 31:14      | But yes, I do keep an extra one.                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:15      | This is one of the reasons why I got the wireless CarPlay adapter.                                                                                                       |
| 31:19      | Because I wanted to not have to worry about a cable working.                                                                                                             |
| 31:23      | But in my car, I do have a lightning cable.                                                                                                                              |
| 31:26      | And I also have a [[MagSafe]] charger, which is permanently plugged in.                                                                                                      |
| 31:29      | And then if I'm going somewhere that is more than, like, a 15-minute drive,                                                                                              |
| 31:33      | I will get my phone out of my bag and [[MagSafe]] it to charge it.                                                                                                           |
| 31:37      | Because that is ideal.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:39      | And it means I'd have to fiddle with, like, actually plugging things in accurately.                                                                                      |
| 31:44      | And the [[MagSafe]] works.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:45      | My car, theoretically, has a wireless charger built in.                                                                                                                  |
| 31:48      | However, the wireless charger is...                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:51      | persnickety, one might say.                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:53      | Picky, flaky, dodgy.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:55      | It doesn't like charging my phone for whatever reason.                                                                                                                   |
| 31:57      | It keeps telling me that there's metal on the charging pad.                                                                                                              |
| 32:00      | And I have to remove it.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:01      | And it's like, my iPhone's got [[MagSafe]].                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:02      | I can't take the metal out of the phone.                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:04      | It doesn't work.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:05      | That's kind of funny, actually.                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:07      | It is.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 32:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:09      | I think Renault did not realise that, you know, phones contain metal.                                                                                                    |
| 32:13      | And their metal sensor is a little bit too sensitive.                                                                                                                    |
| 32:16      | And therefore it disables the wireless charging for safety purposes.                                                                                                     |
| 32:19      | So it doesn't overheat a piece of metal and set your car on fire.                                                                                                        |
| 32:21      | Which, you know, I see the benefit of not setting your car on fire.                                                                                                      |
| 32:25      | But also, my phone has metal in it and I would like to charge it.                                                                                                        |
| 32:28      | You're just making me feel better about my cable, Rose.                                                                                                                  |
| 32:31      | I like my [[MagSafe]] charger.                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:32      | I've just got a [[MagSafe]] charger.                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:34      | I use the [[MagSafe]] charger all the time.                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:36      | And it means that my phone definitely gets charged easily without me                                                                                                     |

| 35:06      | All right, Dave.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35:08      | We've talked about home automation, car automation.                                                                                                                      |
| 35:11      | Are you doing anything in the cloud?                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:13      | Well, I'm doing a lot in the cloud.                                                                                                                                      |
| 35:15      | I would say that the A-Lady stuff that I do is in the cloud                                                                                                              |
| 35:18      | because that certainly requires the cloud for that to happen.                                                                                                            |
| 35:21      | It's not like [[HomeKit]] where it's sort of happening locally.                                                                                                              |
| 35:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 35:28      | But I've been using IFTTT for a very long time,                                                                                                                          |
| 35:32      | and there are so many things that I have IFTTT do                                                                                                                        |
| 35:35      | that I simply forgot about until prepping for this show.                                                                                                                 |
| 35:39      | That was sort of the place where it was like,                                                                                                                            |
| 35:41      | ooh, I need to mine that                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:43      | because there's all kinds of things happening.                                                                                                                           |
| 35:46      | One of them, and this is sort of smart home,                                                                                                                             |
| 35:50      | you'll laugh hopefully after I explain what it does.                                                                                                                     |
| 35:55      | Our windows are not automatic.                                                                                                                                           |
| 35:58      | They are not Wi-Fi windows.                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:00      | They're standard old-school windows                                                                                                                                      |
| 36:02      | that we have to open and close.                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:04      | And I live here in New England,                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:06      | and in the spring and fall, and even in the summer, really,                                                                                                              |
| 36:09      | it is not uncommon for us to, for example,                                                                                                                               |
| 36:13      | run heat in the morning and AC in the afternoon at times.                                                                                                                |
| 36:17      | And also to have the windows open perhaps in the morning,                                                                                                                |
| 36:23      | in the summer, and in the evening in the summer,                                                                                                                         |
| 36:25      | and then run the AC in the middle of the day.                                                                                                                            |
| 36:27      | And so I have these IFTTT routines                                                                                                                                       |
| 36:30      | that check my local temperature.                                                                                                                                         |
| 36:32      | And I actually think they're checking it.                                                                                                                                |
| 36:34      | I need to dig into this now.                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:36      | I don't think it's just getting the temperature                                                                                                                          |
| 36:38      | from, like, weather source.                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:39      | I think it's actually getting it from, like,                                                                                                                             |
| 36:41      | a Netatmo device that I have at the house.                                                                                                                               |
| 36:44      | But when the temp drops below, you know, 72,                                                                                                                             |
| 36:48      | it sends me an email saying,                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:50      | okay, you can open the windows.                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:52      | And when it rises above it, then it sends me an email saying,                                                                                                            |
| 36:55      | okay, now you can close the windows                                                                                                                                      |
| 36:57      | so that you're not letting, you know,                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:59      | the heat from outside into the house in the summer                                                                                                                       |
| 37:02      | and, you know, kind of keeping it from having to run the AC                                                                                                              |
| 37:06      | as much as we might otherwise have to do.                                                                                                                                |
| 37:08      | And I do, I get these little emails and, you know,                                                                                                                       |
| 37:10      | it's like, great.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:11      | And I could do these with IFTTT,                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:13      | you can do email notifications,                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:15      | you can do push notifications,                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:16      | you can do lots of different things.                                                                                                                                     |
| 37:18      | I chose to use emails because I don't know why.                                                                                                                          |
| 37:21      | It's, you know, it's what I chose when I set it up.                                                                                                                      |
| 37:23      | And I mean, I see these almost every day,                                                                                                                                |
| 37:26      | unless it's, you know, 80 degrees or something,                                                                                                                          |
| 37:28      | and then I don't get any of these emails                                                                                                                                 |
| 37:30      | because the trigger points are never hit.                                                                                                                                |
| 37:32      | But, you know, I see them almost every day,                                                                                                                              |
| 37:34      | all summer long, certainly in the fall and the spring,                                                                                                                   |
| 37:37      | and never think about it, that it's, oh yeah,                                                                                                                            |
| 37:39      | that's this automation that I set up to do this.                                                                                                                         |
| 37:41      | It's just like this thing that exists in my life                                                                                                                         |
| 37:43      | because it's so reliable.                                                                                                                                                |
| 37:45      | And it just appears in my inbox.                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:47      | And it's like, and I can choose what to do with that information.                                                                                                        |
| 37:49      | A lot of times I just delete it.                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:51      | It's like, yeah, like I'm not going to go through the house                                                                                                              |
| 37:53      | and open or close all the windows.                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:54      | It's fine.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 37:56      | But, you know, but it's, it's the heads up, man.                                                                                                                         |
| 37:58      | Like, I know your head's down and whatever you're doing,                                                                                                                 |
| 38:00      | but here's this piece of information you thought you wanted.                                                                                                             |
| 38:02      | Have you ever considered using the new branching                                                                                                                         |
| 38:05      | and if this and that and adding maybe some window sensors to that?                                                                                                       |
| 38:08      | So it only sends you an email to close the windows                                                                                                                       |
| 38:10      | if any of the windows are open, for example.                                                                                                                             |
| 38:12      | I like this.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:13      | I have not.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:14      | No, I've been an IFTTT user for a long time, as I said,                                                                                                                    |
| 38:18      | and I have not branched out.                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:20      | I don't think I've created a new,                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:22      | I don't even think I've edited an existing applet                                                                                                                        |
| 38:25      | since all of that came to the product and to the platform.                                                                                                               |
| 38:30      | But that's a great idea, right?                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:32      | Because that way it could be a whole lot smarter about, yeah,                                                                                                            |
| 38:35      | yeah, dumb dumb.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 38:36      | Like the windows are actually closed.                                                                                                                                    |
| 38:38      | You want them open as opposed to open the windows.                                                                                                                       |
| 38:40      | Like, yeah, yeah, they're open.                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:41      | It's all good.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:42      | Yeah, I like that idea.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 38:43      | That's good.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:44      | I know, I know you mentioned earlier that you've got ring cameras                                                                                                        |
| 38:46      | and so on.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:47      | And I know ring do have a security system that you can,                                                                                                                  |
| 38:50      | that has window and door sensors, which would,                                                                                                                           |
| 38:53      | which will almost certainly integrate with if this and that,                                                                                                             |
| 38:56      | which is pretty good.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 38:57      | I'm using Aqara sensors and so on personally,                                                                                                                            |
| 39:00      | but I'm using that either with [[Home Assistant]]                                                                                                                            |
| 39:03      | or directly locally.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:04      | So that's not going to necessarily have if this and that,                                                                                                                |
| 39:07      | if this, then that integration.                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:09      | But I'm pretty sure that the ring stuff would.                                                                                                                           |
| 39:11      | Well, and I've got some, now that you say this,                                                                                                                          |
| 39:13      | see, this is the beauty of talking about these things,                                                                                                                   |
| 39:15      | is you get the opportunity not only to rethink it,                                                                                                                       |
| 39:18      | but to like have you offer input that I probably                                                                                                                         |
| 39:21      | never would have thought of.                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:22      | And it's like, I have some simply safe sensors                                                                                                                           |
| 39:24      | throughout the house.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 39:25      | And it's like, well, of course they know whether the windows                                                                                                             |
| 39:27      | are open or closed.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:28      | Well, there we go.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:29      | And there you go.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:30      | So this is information that is literally at my fingertips.                                                                                                               |
| 39:32      | And if I can maintain my composure,                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:36      | I won't go and edit my IFTTT applets while we are doing this show.                                                                                                         |
| 39:40      | Well, one thing I found with IFTTT that was quite useful,                                                                                                                  |
| 39:44      | because as you mentioned before,                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:45      | you don't necessarily want to break your own home automations                                                                                                            |
| 39:48      | when you're doing this stuff.                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:49      | And so what I've used to do with if this and that applets                                                                                                                |
| 39:52      | is I would duplicate the applet before like doing the new one                                                                                                            |
| 39:57      | and I just disable the old one.                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:58      | So if there was a problem and things weren't going right,                                                                                                                |
| 40:00      | then I could disable the new one and re-enable the old one.                                                                                                              |
| 40:03      | So like a versioning system basically for the applets.                                                                                                                   |
| 40:06      | But that worked pretty well for me                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:08      | and that might be worth looking into for you,                                                                                                                            |
| 40:10      | especially because you've had this working for so long.                                                                                                                  |
| 40:13      | Like you don't want to break that really great streak of stuff works.                                                                                                    |
| 40:16      | See, this is why you get the big bucks.                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:17      | That's a really smart thing to do is,                                                                                                                                    |
| 40:19      | because I would just go in and edit the live applet                                                                                                                      |
| 40:23      | and have no recourse if I completely screw things up.                                                                                                                    |
| 40:28      | I mean, at least this one's just sending emails to you.                                                                                                                  |
| 40:30      | It's not like it's going to make your living room dark                                                                                                                   |
| 40:33      | in the middle of the day                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:34      | when Daisy's rocking Christmas presents,                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:36      | which might get you in trouble.                                                                                                                                          |
| 40:38      | I have no doubt it would.                                                                                                                                                |
| 40:40      | I should put that on a cloud-based automation.                                                                                                                           |
| 40:42      | Just do it randomly.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:43      | That would be so good for our marriage.                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:46      | Yes, yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 40:48      | It may be something to talk about.                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:50      | That's for sure.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 40:51      | Yeah, sound sensor.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:52      | When a show could barks, then it turns off the lights.                                                                                                                   |
| 40:55      | I want you to barks again.                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:56      | It turns them back home.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:57      | There we go.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 40:58      | That would be quite an automation.                                                                                                                                       |
| 41:01      | But the nice thing about if this than that,                                                                                                                              |
| 41:03      | I think is its simplicity.                                                                                                                                               |
| 41:05      | It is very easy to get into that.                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:07      | If you're listening, you haven't tried it.                                                                                                                               |
| 41:09      | Just go IFTTTt.com, set up an account                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:12      | and just try to make a few basic ones                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:14      | because even now they've added multiple conditions,                                                                                                                      |
| 41:17      | which is great, which is what we all wanted.                                                                                                                             |
| 41:19      | But even just the single condition ones,                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:21      | I have used IFTTTt this than that extensively with my day one.                                                                                                             |
| 41:26      | Every time I put a new blog post up at MacSparky,                                                                                                                       |
| 41:30      | it grabs the post from the feed                                                                                                                                          |
| 41:32      | and it creates an entry in day one.                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:34      | I've got this running diary of blog posts.                                                                                                                               |
| 41:38      | I do the same thing with tweets that I favourite.                                                                                                                         |
| 41:41      | I don't favor it very many,                                                                                                                                              |
| 41:42      | but they show up in my...                                                                                                                                                |
| 41:43      | I've got a separate diary for those.                                                                                                                                     |
| 41:45      | And it's really fun to go back years later                                                                                                                               |
| 41:48      | and see what I was doing that day                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:50      | or what was on my mind.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 41:52      | And if this than that really excels, in my opinion,                                                                                                                      |
| 41:57      | at that simple cloud-based automation stuff.                                                                                                                             |
| 42:01      | Yeah, I'm doing similar things I have.                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:03      | We create a new document for every episode of Mac Geek Gab                                                                                                                 |
| 42:06      | and I have it save those show notes documents to Evernote                                                                                                                |
| 42:11      | so that I just have an archive of those things.                                                                                                                          |
| 42:13      | And I have another one for when any photos                                                                                                                               |
| 42:18      | that I am tagged in on Facebook,                                                                                                                                         |
| 42:20      | it grabs them and saves them to my folder on my Dropbox                                                                                                                  |
| 42:24      | so that I just have those photos.                                                                                                                                        |
| 42:26      | And you never have to open Facebook pretty smart.                                                                                                                        |
| 42:29      | And I never...                                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:30      | Yeah, that's right.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 42:31      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:32      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:35      | I don't even know if some of these work.                                                                                                                                 |
| 42:37      | I mean, I'm looking.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 42:38      | I can see that...                                                                                                                                                        |
| 42:39      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 42:40      | I think the history is like, yeah, it ran most recently,                                                                                                                 |
| 42:43      | three days ago.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:44      | It's like, oh, I guess it's still working.                                                                                                                               |
| 42:46      | Cool.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:47      | Great.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:48      | That is the ideal automation, though, isn't it?                                                                                                                          |
| 42:50      | It's something that you set up                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:51      | and you've completely forgotten about.                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:52      | And if it stopped working,                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:53      | I'm sure you would hear about it really, really quickly                                                                                                                  |
| 42:56      | from anybody else, you know, the people who are on Facebook                                                                                                              |
| 42:59      | looking at these posts and so on and so forth.                                                                                                                           |
| 43:01      | But it really does make your life easier                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:03      | because it's just a thing that you don't have to do                                                                                                                      |
| 43:05      | and it's a very simple, small task.                                                                                                                                      |
| 43:07      | Yeah, you could hand it off to an admin assistant,                                                                                                                       |
| 43:09      | kind of an admin assistant for everything.                                                                                                                               |
| 43:11      | That's the key.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:12      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 43:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 43:14      | No, it's great.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:15      | It's great.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 43:16      | Like I said with the lights,                                                                                                                                             |
| 43:17      | all these things are things I could easily do myself,                                                                                                                    |
| 43:20      | but not having to stop and think about it.                                                                                                                               |
| 43:24      | There's that whole idea of spotlighting and focus                                                                                                                        |
| 43:29      | and shifting your focus to these recurring mundane things                                                                                                                |
| 43:35      | impacts productivity.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 43:37      | I'm a freak about productivity,                                                                                                                                          |
| 43:39      | mostly because I'm like super distractible.                                                                                                                              |
| 43:41      | So I kind of have to be in order to actually, you know,                                                                                                                  |
| 43:45      | not live in a cardboard box.                                                                                                                                             |
| 43:47      | So these things really are valuable to me in that way.                                                                                                                   |
| 43:52      | It's great.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 43:53      | And honestly, I mean, this is a bigger topic,                                                                                                                            |
| 43:55      | but you know, I call it contextual computing.                                                                                                                            |
| 43:58      | But the whole idea is that computers                                                                                                                                     |
| 44:00      | aren't necessarily good or bad for you.                                                                                                                                  |
| 44:03      | It depends on how you use them for a lot of people.                                                                                                                      |
| 44:06      | They're massive distraction machines,                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:08      | which keep them from doing what they truly want to accomplish                                                                                                            |
| 44:10      | in their life.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:11      | And for others, there are tools to help you along the way,                                                                                                               |
| 44:15      | but automation is just a great way to help you stay on target                                                                                                            |
| 44:20      | and do the stuff that you really want to be doing                                                                                                                        |
| 44:23      | rather than having the, you know,                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:25      | futz around with the internet.                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:27      | And that's why I make, you know, that's why we make this show.                                                                                                           |
| 44:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:31      | Well, and for me, computers are both of those things simultaneously.                                                                                                     |
| 44:35      | It is a distraction and a tool.                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:37      | And automation lets me claw back some of that time                                                                                                                       |
| 44:40      | that computers allow me to be distracted.                                                                                                                                |
| 44:42      | So it's good.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:44      | I mean, it's like you really have to manage it.                                                                                                                          |
| 44:47      | You can't just open a computer and expect to get your work done.                                                                                                         |
| 44:51      | If anything, that's only got worse, right?                                                                                                                               |
| 44:56      | It used to be that way.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 44:58      | Like there was a period of time, like in the beginning,                                                                                                                  |
| 45:00      | for me anyway, computers were a playground, right?                                                                                                                       |
| 45:04      | Like I said, you know, I would, I would program occasionally.                                                                                                            |
| 45:07      | I would have apps that other people wrote that I would use,                                                                                                              |
| 45:09      | but it was a playground and, and, but, you know,                                                                                                                         |
| 45:12      | learning valuable skills that obviously I still employ today.                                                                                                            |
| 45:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:16      | And, and then there was a period of time where computers were that,                                                                                                      |
| 45:18      | that more of a tool than anything else.                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:21      | And now, like you said, especially with social media and like all the,                                                                                                   |
| 45:24      | the, the global connectivity, ubiquitous connectivity of these devices,                                                                                                  |
| 45:30      | that changed them forever into being these potentially super distractible devices,                                                                                       |
| 45:38      | because it's not you, you know, even when I was playing with computers as a kid,                                                                                         |
| 45:45      | I was in charge of my own interruptions, right?                                                                                                                          |
| 45:49      | Like I was choosing every path that I took,                                                                                                                              |
| 45:52      | whereas now interruptions come in from other people.                                                                                                                     |
| 45:56      | And, and that's not always a bad thing,                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:59      | but it does a lot.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46:00      | Like it's this channel, it used to be a channel where I could escape the world,                                                                                          |
| 46:03      | and now it is my channel to connect with the world.                                                                                                                      |
| 46:06      | And that, that is 180 degrees different from when I started using these things.                                                                                          |
| 46:09      | Yeah. I mean, once they monetised human attention, everything changed.                                                                                                   |
| 46:13      | And yet here we are monetising human attention.                                                                                                                          |
| 46:16      | You bet.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:17      | But we're, we're sharing information.                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:18      | It's totally different, you know?                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:20      | I know what we're doing.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:21      | I'm not making you whack a mole.                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:22      | I'm helping you get better at this stuff.                                                                                                                                |
| 46:24      | No, it's true.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:25      | Yeah, it doesn't mean it's not valuable.                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:27      | All right. So cloud stuff you're doing in IFTTT.                                                                                                                         |
| 46:31      | Now let's get back to the Mac.                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:34      | I understand you know a little bit about the Mac with 17 years of Mac Geek Gab.                                                                                              |
| 46:39      | A little bit.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:41      | I've been forced to, forced to be a Mac user,                                                                                                                            |
| 46:43      | but which is not anything anyone would have to force on me.                                                                                                              |
| 46:46      | I'm happy to, to do it.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 46:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 46:50      | So what, what are the tools you use to do automation on the Mac?                                                                                                         |
| 46:53      | I use AppleScript.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:55      | I use automator, but really for me these days, the present and I believe, well,                                                                                          |
| 47:01      | maybe not entire future of automation on the Mac has been [[Keyboard Maestro]] shortcuts,                                                                                    |
| 47:06      | changes that a little bit and which in a good way,                                                                                                                       |
| 47:08      | because it opens it up for a lot more people.                                                                                                                            |
| 47:11      | But for me, [[Keyboard Maestro]] sort of sits at the core of what I do on the Mac.                                                                                           |
| 47:17      | It is my default go to when I need to automate something on my Mac.                                                                                                      |
| 47:22      | Just because it's so flexible and so powerful and it's so well integrated with everything                                                                                |
| 47:28      | that I would need to do, including automator and AppleScript and the terminal.                                                                                          |
| 47:33      | And you know, it's, it's so flexible.                                                                                                                                    |
| 47:36      | I know we started here in the episode talking about my podcast chaptering tool,                                                                                          |
| 47:40      | which is [[Keyboard Maestro]] and [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros sync to all of my Macs if I want them to,                                                                          |
| 47:45      | which I do.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 47:46      | And you can intelligently turn groups of macros on and off on certain Macs.                                                                                              |
| 47:51      | So if, you know, I never would record a podcast in the office,                                                                                                           |
| 47:54      | I can turn those off so that those keystrokes don't start doing wonky things.                                                                                            |
| 48:00      | I, there's a lot of different things I do with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                         |
| 48:05      | One is I, like many of us, I'm sure have network drives that I connect to when I'm in my office,                                                                         |
| 48:12      | either, you know, with my desktop machines all the time or my laptop when I'm, when I'm here.                                                                            |
| 48:17      | And so I have a, a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that will, well, first I have an automator action                                                                              |
| 48:26      | that mounts my network drives when it's run as an app.                                                                                                                   |
| 48:29      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 48:30      | So I've, I've saved this.                                                                                                                                                |
| 48:31      | It's very, very straightforward.                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:32      | It just goes and, and mounts these drives that actually checks to make sure they are not mounted                                                                         |
| 48:39      | and then, and then mounts them so that I don't wind up with multiple, multiple things.                                                                                   |
| 48:45      | But, but it's, it's, you know, fairly straightforward.                                                                                                                   |
| 48:47      | It's just an application.                                                                                                                                                |
| 48:48      | It mounts my network drives.                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:49      | I use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to choose when to launch that application.                                                                                                        |
| 48:54      | I used to just put it in my login items on my Mac, but that didn't solve a lot of my problems                                                                            |
| 49:01      | because it was only doing it when I logged in as opposed to intelligently doing it                                                                                       |
| 49:06      | whenever I lost a connection to my network drives.                                                                                                                       |
| 49:10      | And with [[Keyboard Maestro]], it's been fantastic because I,                                                                                                                |
| 49:14      | I can have it and, and do have it run that at log in, but I also have it check.                                                                                          |
| 49:19      | And, you know, if, if a volume is one of my network volumes is offline and I am on the Wi-Fi network                                                                     |
| 49:27      | that is my home Wi-Fi network, then okay, great.                                                                                                                         |
| 49:31      | Go and run that script and let's get everything connected.                                                                                                               |
| 49:34      | And so it, you know, it's, it's again, it's one of those simple things that makes a huge difference                                                                      |
| 49:41      | because when I'm in the middle of trying to go save a file and I want to save it                                                                                         |
| 49:45      | or open it, you know, from a network drive, finding that I'm not connected to it                                                                                         |
| 49:50      | is a major point of distraction.                                                                                                                                         |
| 49:52      | It's like, okay, now I need to go and connect to it and figure out why and, you know,                                                                                    |
| 49:55      | but otherwise it's just, now it's just there most of the time.                                                                                                           |
| 49:58      | It's not flawless because networks are not flawless, but it, you know, it, it mitigates a lot                                                                            |
| 50:04      | of the simple problems that can happen with, you know, just losing when Mac goes to sleep.                                                                               |
| 50:09      | It doesn't always reconnect when it wakes up.                                                                                                                            |
| 50:11      | So Keyboard Micro, [[Keyboard Maestro]] is, is my, is my friend there.                                                                                                       |
| 50:16      | And there's so many ways to solve that problem with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                    |
| 50:19      | You know, like it has.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:20      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 50:21      | Commands that you can use.                                                                                                                                               |
| 50:22      | Or like in my case, I've, I've recently switched to the new MacBook Pro course                                                                                           |
| 50:27      | and I don't have a desktop machine anymore.                                                                                                                              |
| 50:30      | So I'm, I am occasionally disconnecting this computer from the disk array and the,                                                                                       |
| 50:36      | the screen and everything to take it somewhere else.                                                                                                                     |
| 50:39      | And you want to properly eject your disks like a gentleman.                                                                                                              |
| 50:43      | And I wrote like a two line AppleScript that does it, you know, it's very simple,                                                                                       |
| 50:48      | but then I just embed that into [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                        |
| 50:51      | And now it's a thing I can run as part of any automation, like I'm ready to go.                                                                                          |
| 50:56      | I don't have to go look for some dumb menu bar app or anything.                                                                                                          |
| 50:59      | I just run a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script and the disks eject.                                                                                                                |
| 51:02      | And I just love that flexibility that it brings.                                                                                                                         |
| 51:06      | No matter how you want to scratch the itch, there's a way to do it with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                |
| 51:10      | Yeah, I think of [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                       |
| 51:12      | The Maestro part of the name is, is certainly accurate.                                                                                                                  |
| 51:15      | I think of it as the conductor of, of sort of all of my max automations.                                                                                                 |
| 51:18      | Keyboard is, is not inaccurate, but it is a limiting descriptor of the app                                                                                               |
| 51:24      | because it does not have to run based on a keyboard shortcut to trigger an action.                                                                                       |
| 51:30      | Actions can be triggered in macros for lots of different circumstances                                                                                                   |
| 51:34      | as we were just talking about.                                                                                                                                           |
| 51:35      | So did you know you can trigger it with a MIDI signal?                                                                                                                   |
| 51:38      | So yeah, I do.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 51:40      | I, when there was a short period of time where we were using Memo Live to stream                                                                                         |
| 51:47      | our Mac Geek Gab recordings when, right when we started with video,                                                                                                        |
| 51:51      | turned out that Memo Live was not nearly stable enough to actually do that with.                                                                                         |
| 51:55      | So now we're using some online tools like Mellon and stuff.                                                                                                              |
| 51:58      | But Memo Live, because it was running on my Mac,                                                                                                                         |
| 52:01      | allowed me to do several different things and I could change scenes                                                                                                      |
| 52:06      | by calling a URL endpoint inside of Memo Live.                                                                                                                           |
| 52:11      | So if you don't know what a URL endpoint is,                                                                                                                             |
| 52:13      | it sounds a whole lot more complex than it, than it actually is.                                                                                                         |
| 52:16      | It's just a, a magic link.                                                                                                                                               |
| 52:20      | Thank you. Perfect.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 52:21      | You've used this term before on your show.                                                                                                                               |
| 52:23      | Great. Yeah.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 52:24      | So it's a magic link and the app will give it to you.                                                                                                                    |
| 52:26      | So it gives you the link and if you launch that magic link in Safari,                                                                                                    |
| 52:29      | it will trigger whatever the app's going to do.                                                                                                                          |
| 52:31      | And so you can have [[Keyboard Maestro]] launch that magic link instead.                                                                                                     |
| 52:35      | And I had those magic links wired up via [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                               |
| 52:39      | Anytime I hit a certain MIDI key, which was on this mixer I was using,                                                                                                   |
| 52:44      | it would then trigger and call the magic link.                                                                                                                           |
| 52:47      | I moved away from that mixer.                                                                                                                                            |
| 52:49      | So I changed it from MIDI to function keys on my Mac,                                                                                                                    |
| 52:52      | specifically the seven function keys on the keyboard that are not assigned to anything                                                                                   |
| 52:57      | over on the right side of the extended keyboard on the Mac.                                                                                                              |
| 53:00      | And, and those worked for a while.                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:02      | But now, like I said, we, we moved on from Memo Live.                                                                                                                    |
| 53:04      | So I'm not using them.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:05      | I'm so pleased you said that because I was thinking of everyone I know,                                                                                                  |
| 53:09      | you know, who has the right mix of a Venn diagram of automation and music                                                                                                |
| 53:17      | to ever use a MIDI trigger.                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:19      | And I thought if there was anybody I know that would do it, it'd be Dave Hamilton.                                                                                       |
| 53:22      | And now you have affirmed that.                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:23      | So thank you.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 53:24      | Yeah, of course.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:25      | Yeah, no, MIDI triggers are great.                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:27      | And, and, you know, there's, go ahead.                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:29      | Can you send a MIDI signal with a digital drum?                                                                                                                          |
| 53:31      | I don't even know if you can.                                                                                                                                            |
| 53:32      | I guess you would be able to, right?                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:34      | Digital drums are all MIDI.                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:35      | That's how it works.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:36      | Yeah, of course.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:37      | Of course it is.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 53:38      | So like, so you could hit a symbol to start off your podcast.                                                                                                            |
| 53:40      | That'd be amazing.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:41      | I could.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:42      | I could.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:43      | Yeah, I don't, but I could.                                                                                                                                              |
| 53:45      | But, but like for my podcast and, and this, you know, as you, as you're listening to this,                                                                               |
| 53:51      | take podcast out of it and insert your, you know, work environments here, your work flows                                                                                |
| 53:57      | here as it were, you know, when I, when I'm getting ready to record a podcast, I need                                                                                    |
| 54:04      | to launch a bunch of apps.                                                                                                                                               |
| 54:05      | I actually use Logic Pro as my mixer now.                                                                                                                                |
| 54:08      | I have an app separate from Logic called [[Audio Hijack]] that I used to record.                                                                                             |
| 54:11      | I know it sounds crazy, but like this is, it works better this way.                                                                                                      |
| 54:14      | I get files easier.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:15      | And I have, you know, various other things like our chapters document that I launched                                                                                    |
| 54:19      | and ever note that we use for different things in the chat room that we use when we live                                                                                 |
| 54:23      | stream and all of these things that have to, to, to launch when I'm getting ready to do                                                                                  |
| 54:28      | the show.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:29      | And so I use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to launch all of those apps and, and put them in the right                                                                                 |
| 54:33      | places on my screen and, and set up my environment so that I can click one button, have it launch                                                                        |
| 54:40      | all that.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:41      | And then I'm just ready to go.                                                                                                                                           |
| 54:42      | And I don't have to stop and think about, Oh, is that open?                                                                                                              |
| 54:45      | Am I going to run into a problem with that?                                                                                                                              |
| 54:47      | And I know we all have these things for in our, in our work and even personal lives where                                                                                |
| 54:52      | it's like, I'm about to do a thing that I do regularly.                                                                                                                  |
| 54:56      | I want all of this stuff open.                                                                                                                                           |
| 54:58      | And perhaps I want all of this stuff open, but that stuff closed.                                                                                                        |
| 55:01      | Okay, great.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:02      | Close it all out, you know, and, and just get your computer set up.                                                                                                      |
| 55:05      | And I know, again, it's, you know, can I open and close apps without an automation?                                                                                      |
| 55:10      | Of course.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 55:11      | All the time, but it makes life a whole lot simpler.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:14      | If I can just sit down and boom, I hit it, wait, I need patients to let the computer                                                                                     |
| 55:18      | finish doing what it's doing, you know, but it does it for me.                                                                                                           |
| 55:21      | And it's fantastic.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 55:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:24      | And I guarantee you it's faster than you're doing it manually.                                                                                                           |
| 55:26      | And it's one less thing you have to worry about.                                                                                                                         |
| 55:29      | You don't have to worry once you start recording or doing your work, whatever their work is,                                                                             |
| 55:34      | is that app open or is that doc available?                                                                                                                               |
| 55:37      | It just, it's handled every time.                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:39      | I mean,                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:40      | I can tell you, it limits the opportunities for human error is really what it is.                                                                                        |
| 55:43      | I do like setups.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:44      | So I call these setups, you know, like a setup to write a setup to do client work, a setup                                                                               |
| 55:49      | to record whatever it is.                                                                                                                                                |
| 55:51      | I mean, that is some of the best automation time you can spend putting those together.                                                                                   |
| 55:55      | And it is so satisfying.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55:57      | I even think it helps your brain because like you sit down and you push a button, whether                                                                                |
| 56:03      | it be through [[Keyboard Maestro]] or a Stream Deck or an F sharp on your keyboard.                                                                                          |
| 56:08      | And suddenly your computer just transforms itself into a machine to do that thing, that                                                                                  |
| 56:13      | one thing.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:14      | You know, and we were talking earlier about how they're distraction machines.                                                                                            |
| 56:17      | Well, if it suddenly just gives you only the tools you need to do that one thing, guess                                                                                  |
| 56:21      | what?                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 56:22      | Your brain is going to be ready to do that one thing.                                                                                                                    |
| 56:24      | That's it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:25      | That exactly.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 56:27      | I, um, I have, there's one more app I use on the Mac that, that certainly falls into                                                                                     |
| 56:32      | the category of automation and is super valuable and it's free.                                                                                                          |
| 56:36      | It's quitter from Marco Arment, same person who makes overcast that we were talking about                                                                                 |
| 56:40      | earlier here.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:41      | And it does one thing.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:43      | Well, it really does two things.                                                                                                                                         |
| 56:45      | It will monitor when you have last used an app, not how long your Mac's awake, not any                                                                                   |
| 56:51      | of that, but how long it's been since you've last used any given app.                                                                                                    |
| 56:55      | And then you can tell it to either quit that app or sleep that app or not sleep that up,                                                                                 |
| 57:00      | hide that app.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:01      | Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 57:02      | Uh, I do this for a variety of reasons.                                                                                                                                  |
| 57:06      | Uh, my favourite one is Safari because, and really this is true of any web browser.                                                                                       |
| 57:12      | If I leave Safari running for multiple days, it will blow it up and my Mac starts acting                                                                                 |
| 57:18      | all weird.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 57:19      | So I know that I want to quit Safari once a day.                                                                                                                         |
| 57:21      | So I set it after I have not used Safari for 180 minutes to quit Safari.                                                                                                 |
| 57:26      | It almost never quits in the middle of my day because I'm using Safari for a variety                                                                                     |
| 57:31      | of things and it's rare that I could go three hours without at least making Safari my active                                                                             |
| 57:36      | app.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 57:37      | But overnight it quits it and I get to wake up every day and hit my computer and launch                                                                                  |
| 57:42      | Safari and I'm back in business.                                                                                                                                         |
| 57:44      | And I could even have a, as you like, I like your term set up, I could even have a keyboard                                                                              |
| 57:48      | maestro set up that launches all the apps that have been quit overnight if I wanted                                                                                      |
| 57:51      | to, you know, when I, when I first wake up my computer in the morning, like there's an                                                                                   |
| 57:54      | automation to be built there, but quitter is fantastic for these kinds of things.                                                                                        |
| 58:00      | And I have it, you know, I have a variety of other ones.                                                                                                                 |
| 58:03      | My wife, we use QuickBooks for the various businesses here and we share the files.                                                                                       |
| 58:08      | And so I don't want to accidentally leave QuickBooks open and then leave.                                                                                                |
| 58:13      | And now she goes to launch QuickBooks because she works for the businesses too.                                                                                          |
| 58:18      | And now we've got the file open in two places.                                                                                                                           |
| 58:20      | That's bad.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 58:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:22      | So I have it quit QuickBooks after 30 minutes of an activity, you know, these sorts of things.                                                                           |
| 58:26      | Once you start doing it with quitter, it becomes one of those tools that I can't live without                                                                            |
| 58:31      | because it's just like, oh yeah, it's just taking care of not letting these things stay                                                                                  |
| 58:35      | open that I definitely don't want to stay open.                                                                                                                          |
| 58:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:39      | And another piece of your setup that I think is interesting is the idea of quitting apps                                                                                 |
| 58:44      | when you're starting a set up, like let's say that you're going to go into spreadsheet                                                                                   |
| 58:49      | mode at work.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:50      | Well, why not close out your word processor and, you know, get those distractions off                                                                                    |
| 58:55      | your desk.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 58:57      | Definitely close Facebook if that's a thing for you, you know, and [[Keyboard Maestro]] just                                                                                 |
| 59:02      | makes that all available to you.                                                                                                                                         |
| 59:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 59:05      | I actually use [[Bunch]] for this by [[Brett Terpstra]] because it just gives me like a list of the                                                                              |
| 59:10      | different like setups that I might need from my menu bar and it's great because I've got                                                                                 |
| 59:15      | like podcasting preparation and I've got preparing for automators and nested folders                                                                                     |
| 59:19      | and stuff there and that opens one series of apps.                                                                                                                       |
| 59:21      | And I've got a recording section with record automators, which is currently active and that                                                                              |
| 59:26      | does things like it opens [[Audio Hijack]] and it even presses, I think it's command one.                                                                                    |
| 59:31      | I don't even remember anymore to get you to the session view so that every time I launch                                                                                 |
| 59:36      | [[Audio Hijack]], that's what it does.                                                                                                                                       |
| 59:38      | It calls this tiny micro snippet that just does that for me, but it means that I always                                                                                  |
| 59:42      | get exactly what I need when I'm looking to do things and it makes sure to quit certain                                                                                  |
| 59:47      | pesky applications that I might have open that I don't want to open for that sort of                                                                                     |
| 59:52      | thing.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 59:53      | Dave, I want to tell you something, Dave, I don't want you to try Bunch until you have                                                                                   |
| 59:57      | at least four hours available because I know you and that is going to be at least a four                                                                                 |
| 01:00:04   | hour investigation for you because Bunch is amazing.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:00:08   | Is this the point where I say that I have a bunch for editing Bunch?                                                                                                     |
| 01:00:11   | Yeah, there you go.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:00:13   | Okay, so I have like a bunch which just opens, let me see what it does, I've got it over                                                                                 |
| 01:00:19   | here somewhere, there it is, edit Bunch files.                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:22   | So it just opens Visual Code Studio and it opens the folder where I have my Bunch files                                                                                  |
| 01:00:28   | in Visual Code Studio and then it opens the Bunch application docs for me in Safari.                                                                                     |
| 01:00:33   | That's all it does, it's really simple, but it just gets me the few things that I need                                                                                   |
| 01:00:37   | whenever I'm doing this because yeah, why not?                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:40   | Are you two still talking because I'm working on this Bunch thing that you told me about?                                                                                |
| 01:00:44   | Yeah, I knew that was going to happen Rose, what did you do?                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:47   | We lost our guest now, I go find somebody else.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:49   | I mean, I tried to do it earlier with the IFTTT stuff, I mean it's not that I'm not loving                                                                                 |
| 01:00:53   | Dave, but you know, we're going to have to have him back on anyway, let's just give him                                                                                  |
| 01:00:57   | more fuel.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:00:58   | Okay, so Dave, I want you to put that in a browser tab and I want you to come back within                                                                                |
| 01:01:02   | 180 minutes, but before we leave, give us another cool [[Keyboard Maestro]] script you're                                                                                    |
| 01:01:10   | running.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:11   | You know, there are those times when you need to paste something and there are two scenarios,                                                                            |
| 01:01:18   | the [[Keyboard Maestro]] solves both of them, but they are different, where you cannot                                                                                       |
| 01:01:24   | paste like into a browser window or into an application where they have somehow magically                                                                                |
| 01:01:30   | disabled your ability to invoke the contents of your clipboard drives me crazy number makes                                                                              |

| 01:01:37   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:38   | Why?                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:39   | Like that's the safest thing to do is paste it in, but you want me to type it.                                                                                           |

| 01:01:50   | I have auto fill for this, but no, you've disabled auto fill and paste.                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:53   | So now I have to try and remember.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:01:55   | All right, solve our problem, Dave.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:57   | Solve the force.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:58   | I have a macro that types the contents of my clipboard and I invoke it with, you know,                                                                                   |
| 01:02:05   | it's like all the keys.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:06   | I mashed down the shift control option command and hit V because that's paced.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:11   | And then it painstaking.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:13   | If you have a long clipboard, sit because this is going to take a little while.                                                                                          |
| 01:02:18   | It's not fast like a paste is where it just pops it in.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:21   | It literally types it with some delays and things like that.                                                                                                             |
| 01:02:25   | Like, you know, for something short, like a banking account number, whatever it goes                                                                                     |
| 01:02:28   | very fast, but that whole type clipboard thing is great.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:31   | And then I also, so that's one thing and I don't want to gloss over that because it's                                                                                    |
| 01:02:36   | super important, but then I also use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to be the thing that pastes without                                                                                |
| 01:02:43   | any style.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:02:44   | I know some apps offer that in the edit menu, but they are inconsistent with it.                                                                                         |
| 01:02:49   | So I have taken over that, that shortcut or that, that keyboard keystroke and I use command                                                                              |
| 01:02:55   | option shift V. And when I do that, it takes the contents of my clipboard, assuming it's                                                                                 |
| 01:03:01   | text and if it's not, it doesn't paste anything, but it takes that text and pastes it as an                                                                              |
| 01:03:06   | actual paste, not a type without any styling whatsoever.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:11   | And so, you know, for when I copy something from Safari and it's inheriting all the, you                                                                                 |
| 01:03:15   | know, styling of the text on the website and I want to paste it into an email or something                                                                               |
| 01:03:19   | whether I don't want style, I just do that and then boom, it, you know, it comes in as                                                                                   |
| 01:03:24   | plain text.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:03:26   | I am someone who values the simplicity of plain text probably more than most, but that's                                                                                 |
| 01:03:33   | how I live with it.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:34   | And that's, again, these are super simple things, but it makes such a difference.                                                                                        |
| 01:03:38   | I have a question going back to your inserting text by typing.                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:42   | You said with some delays and pauses, and I know that [[Keyboard Maestro]] just has an option                                                                                |
| 01:03:46   | for insert text by typing, and then you could just insert the system clipboard, so that                                                                                  |
| 01:03:51   | would be percent system clipboard with the S and C capitalised, no space, percent sign.                                                                                  |
| 01:03:55   | But you said with delays and pauses, if you added something to that artificially to do                                                                                   |
| 01:03:59   | that, or is it just how it works?                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:04:02   | No, it's just how it works.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:04:03   | I am using the action insert text, percent current clipboard percent by typing, and that's                                                                               |
| 01:04:09   | it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:04:10   | But it, yeah, it is insert text by typing, it's the [[Keyboard Maestro]] thing, but it's                                                                                     |
| 01:04:13   | just slow about it.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:04:14   | I don't know why it's slow, but it's slow.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:18   | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:19   | It's just like so much you can do, like when you hack paste, you know, that's like a keyboard                                                                            |
| 01:04:24   | maestro thing.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:04:25   | I have a problem with OmniFocus when I copy a link in OmniFocus, like I have projects                                                                                    |
| 01:04:31   | and tasks that I link in other applications.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:04:34   | I'm a big fan of those magic links, so, but the problem with OmniFocus is when it paste                                                                                  |
| 01:04:39   | the link, it adds a carriage return to the end.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:04:42   | And when I'm like putting the link inside us at a parentheses or something like with                                                                                     |
| 01:04:46   | markdown, that creates a problem.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:04:49   | And I know they're fixing it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:50   | I submitted a bug and they said, yeah, we're getting that handled.                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:53   | But in the meantime, and a guy in the OmniFocus forum turned me on to this idea, I put a conditional                                                                     |
| 01:04:59   | paste in, in a [[Keyboard Maestro]] that says, if the link contains the three slashes in                                                                                     |
| 01:05:06   | the word OmniFocus, which is the OmniFocus link, then pause point one second and do a                                                                                    |
| 01:05:12   | backspace.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:05:13   | I have a better one for you there, David.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:05:16   | All right.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:05:17   | Because OmniFocus, not OmniFocus, [[Keyboard Maestro]] has an option, and I'm struggling                                                                                     |
| 01:05:21   | to remember what it's called at this precise moment in time.                                                                                                             |
| 01:05:24   | But it's something to do with, like, so there's an option somewhere for formatting or similar,                                                                           |
| 01:05:31   | and it can remove blank space from the start and the end of your text, which will do exactly                                                                             |
| 01:05:36   | what you want, because it will get rid of any spaces at the beginning and the end.                                                                                       |
| 01:05:39   | I use this all the time, because it's just really useful to get rid of stuff like an                                                                                     |
| 01:05:46   | extra line break at the end or something like that.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:49   | And so I will find what that action is and put a link to that action in the show notes.                                                                                  |
| 01:05:53   | I'm just generally a fan of the idea that you can perform actions on text in the clipboard                                                                               |
| 01:05:58   | with the [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:06:00   | I think that's a, so if you're not aware of that, that gives you a bunch of, like, Swiss                                                                                 |
| 01:06:05   | Army tools that you might find useful.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:06:09   | We haven't even touched on that [[Keyboard Maestro]] has a clipboard switcher in it.                                                                                         |
| 01:06:13   | If you are running [[Keyboard Maestro]] for other things, my advice is use its clipboard switcher.                                                                           |
| 01:06:18   | But if you're not, use a clipboard switcher.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:06:23   | Talking about life-changing additions to your Mac, having a clipboard history is, I mean,                                                                                |
| 01:06:32   | when I watch people work without it, it's like watching somebody try to type with mittens                                                                                |
| 01:06:37   | on.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:06:38   | You understand that we have a lot of things to talk about here, you know, but it's just                                                                                  |
| 01:06:44   | one of those things.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:45   | But, but it's, it's like anything, if you haven't used it, you don't know that you're                                                                                    |
| 01:06:50   | missing it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:06:51   | It's like talking to someone that's using dial-up and saying, you should get, you know, I mean,                                                                          |
| 01:06:54   | definitely get broadband.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:06:55   | Like, whoa, everything that I do works with, with my dial-up.                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:58   | It's like, right, because you don't have broadband to do the other things that you could do,                                                                             |
| 01:07:04   | right?                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:05   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:06   | You know, it's, it's, it's one of those scenarios.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:07   | It's like, you got to help people find their killer app for it.                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:11   | Because once you do, then it's, it's everywhere.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:07:13   | So they, just quick live follow-up.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07:16   | The action is the filter action.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:07:19   | And so what you can do is you could filter system clipboard with trim white space.                                                                                       |
| 01:07:23   | So that's removing spaces and line breaks and stuff from the start and the end only.                                                                                     |
| 01:07:27   | It will leave everything in the middle intact to source.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:29   | And that means that your clipboard will just be updated to, you know, the correct thing.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:35   | And then you can go ahead and actually do the paste.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:36   | The only problem with that is sometimes I copy text that intentionally has spaces in                                                                                     |
| 01:07:41   | it.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07:42   | No, no, no.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:07:43   | You would still do it the same way that you're doing things with the OmniFocus action.                                                                                   |
| 01:07:45   | Right now, you just replace what you're currently doing with the backspacing to just remove                                                                              |
| 01:07:50   | the white space.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:07:51   | Because when OmniFocus fix that bug, I know, I'm sure Omni Group will, you're going to be                                                                                 |
| 01:07:56   | accidentally backspacing and removing a character from the end of the URL and that is going                                                                              |
| 01:07:59   | to break stuff.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:00   | That is bad.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:01   | So I would recommend trim white space.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:08:04   | That's what it's usually called in programming languages.                                                                                                                |
| 01:08:06   | So I was able to find it thanks to keep up my streaks, excellent wiki.                                                                                                   |
| 01:08:09   | That's awesome.                                                                                                                                                          |

| 01:08:21   | name.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:22   | Hover is one of Relay FM's longest running sponsors and my preferred company when purchasing                                                                             |
| 01:08:28   | domains.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:08:29   | When you have that one big idea, where do you go?                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:32   | Well, your business starts with a domain name.                                                                                                                           |
| 01:08:34   | So for many enterprises, Hover is that big leap.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:38   | Both for MacSparky and my law practice, I went to Hover when I needed to set up a domain.                                                                               |
| 01:08:43   | Hover has over 300 domain name extensions to choose from.                                                                                                                |
| 01:08:47   | No matter what you want to build, there's a domain name waiting for it and they have                                                                                     |
| 01:08:50   | excellent technical support to answer any questions you may have and they're dedicated                                                                                   |
| 01:08:55   | to getting you online, not upselling you.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:08:58   | So many of these domain companies make it a game where they're trying to get you to                                                                                      |
| 01:09:01   | buy stuff you don't need.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:09:03   | Hover doesn't do that.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:04   | Hover has free who is privacy so the bad guys don't get your information, a clean user                                                                                   |
| 01:09:10   | interface, monthly sales on popular top level domains, and it's easy to see why Hover is                                                                                 |
| 01:09:15   | the popular choice for people starting a business.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:09:19   | When it comes to purchasing domains, I am a whale and Hover has got all of my business                                                                                   |
| 01:09:24   | MacSparky's there, the legal stuff.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:27   | Also several related domains related to some of the podcasts that we get over the years.                                                                                 |
| 01:09:31   | So I've got all of that in Hover and it's just super easy to log in and manage that stuff.                                                                               |
| 01:09:36   | If I want to point a domain at a different address, I can do it right in their easy to                                                                                   |
| 01:09:41   | use control panel.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:09:43   | I remember when I was working at the law firm and I went on Hover and I bought sparksesq.com                                                                              |
| 01:09:47   | and that was really the first step I took towards going out on my own and setting up my own                                                                              |
| 01:09:51   | practice and that was all accomplished through Hover.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:09:55   | Another thing I did through Hover was when my children were born, I bought their names                                                                                   |
| 01:09:58   | as domain names and I've handed them off to them as they've got older so they can set                                                                                    |
| 01:10:02   | up their own online presence and they've got great domains that are their names.                                                                                         |
| 01:10:08   | We know you like intuitive user experiences and things that just work straight out of                                                                                    |
| 01:10:12   | the box and you get that with Hover.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:13   | So go to their website at hover.com, the UI is really simple, clean and easy to navigate                                                                                 |
| 01:10:20   | and you can buy your domain and start using it today.                                                                                                                    |

| 01:10:32   | That URL once again is hover.com/automators.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:10:36   | Make a name for yourself with Hover.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:38   | Our thanks to Hover for their support of the automators and all of Relay FM.                                                                                             |
| 01:10:44   | Dave, so you were an automator and pro.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:46   | You've been doing this a long time.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:10:47   | I know you do AppleScript, we've just kind of proven your [[Keyboard Maestro]] chops.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:52   | Let's talk about shortcuts, you know, the democratised automation that Apple's been                                                                                      |
| 01:10:56   | pushing now for a few years.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:58   | What do you think about it and where are you using it?                                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:01   | Oh, I love shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:11:02   | I loved it when it was workflow before Apple picked it up and I still think the way those                                                                                |
| 01:11:07   | guys figured out how to leverage the things that were publicly available in iOS to do the                                                                                |
| 01:11:13   | magic that they do is like they deserve all the success and credit that they've had.                                                                                     |
| 01:11:18   | Oh, yeah, totally.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:20   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:11:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:11:22   | And I do.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:11:23   | I use shortcuts for a variety of things.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:27   | We already talked about my car play thing that I use shortcuts for.                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:32   | I have another really simple one when I travel, I am always more concerned about my phone's                                                                              |
| 01:11:40   | battery life than I am when I'm at home.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:44   | And to preserve my phone's battery life, I like to just leave my phone in low power                                                                                      |
| 01:11:48   | mode the entire time I'm traveling.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:51   | And what I do to ensure that is I set up an automation in in shortcuts that is a two step                                                                                |
| 01:12:01   | automation.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:02   | When low power mode is turned off, like when your phone is charging and hits 80%, do set                                                                                 |
| 01:12:08   | low power mode to on and that way it will turn off for a split second while it's charging                                                                                |
| 01:12:14   | and hits that 80% magic number.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:12:16   | And then it turns low power mode right back on and it stays on 100% of the time while                                                                                    |
| 01:12:21   | I'm traveling and then I can just turn off that automation when I get home.                                                                                              |
| 01:12:24   | If I so choose, of course, you may be somebody who likes to leave your phone in low power                                                                                |
| 01:12:27   | mode all the time.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:12:28   | In that case, you're welcome, you can use it for that too, just leave it on.                                                                                             |
| 01:12:32   | So yeah, yeah, that is really useful for travel.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12:35   | Of course, it's not so ideal at home because you'll do things like not have push notifications                                                                           |
| 01:12:39   | on email and anymore and things like that, which are all the bonuses that low power mode                                                                                 |
| 01:12:43   | can offer, which could be a feature or bug depending on your point of view.                                                                                              |
| 01:12:47   | But that is really useful for travel.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:12:49   | My kids leave their phones in low power mode 100% of the time, but it's because they're                                                                                  |
| 01:12:52   | on them all the time and want to eke out every bit of battery life they possibly can.                                                                                    |
| 01:12:58   | So they have this shortcut running and it never turns off whether they're home traveling                                                                                 |
| 01:13:02   | or what.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:03   | So.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:04   | And it's been my impression in general that kids think a 20% charge is a full charge.                                                                                    |
| 01:13:08   | So there's that.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:10   | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:11   | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:13   | I really like that idea actually.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:14   | I think I might expand that and add something in Data Jar to say I am traveling or I'm not                                                                               |
| 01:13:19   | traveling, something that can be set and then when my phone turns off low power mode,                                                                                    |
| 01:13:24   | it can check to see whether or not it should turn it back on.                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:27   | And then that flag is something that I can just easily enable and disable.                                                                                               |
| 01:13:31   | I can even put a shortcut on my travel home screen because I have a travel focus mode now                                                                                |
| 01:13:36   | thanks to our recent episode.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:37   | So.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:38   | Oh, that's true.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:40   | I like this.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:13:41   | See, this is great.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:42   | This is what I love about this.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:43   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:44   | You got to try Data Jar if you haven't.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:45   | It's really fun.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:46   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:47   | It's a set of global variables that you can store in Data Jar and then that just makes                                                                                   |
| 01:13:54   | shortcuts so much more useful because you don't lose your variable data.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:00   | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:01   | It's great for things that you want to pull in again and again and again.                                                                                                |
| 01:14:04   | I use it for API keys, all sorts of things like counts of how many, you know, vitamins                                                                                   |
| 01:14:10   | I've got left and so on because I log my vitamins by tapping on NFC tag.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:14   | So it just goes ahead and decrements the right number for me every time I do that,                                                                                       |
| 01:14:18   | which means that I can then get warnings after I've done it to say, hey, you're running                                                                                  |
| 01:14:22   | out of these things, you should stock up again, which is quite handy.                                                                                                    |
| 01:14:26   | I didn't know what you said after vitamins because I thought that was so great the way                                                                                   |
| 01:14:29   | you said that word.                                                                                                                                                      |

| 01:14:31   | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:14:32   | Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:33   | Vitamins for the Americans.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:14:34   | There you go.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:35   | Are they the same thing?                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:38   | Almost.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:39   | Ours have got a bonus inside of them in that they just have a British accent.                                                                                            |
| 01:14:44   | Oh, that's, I know that makes them more valuable.                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:47   | Vitamins are classier.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:48   | Let's just leave it at that.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:14:50   | It's classier.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:52   | Another shortcut that I use in shortcuts on my phone all the time really kind of ties                                                                                    |
| 01:14:59   | together a couple of things we've talked about and it is my nap time shortcut.                                                                                           |
| 01:15:03   | I am a big, big fan of the power nap.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:07   | And so, right, but I, the value in the power nap is not being interrupted for the period                                                                                 |
| 01:15:14   | of time that I am, have set to nap because even if I don't fall asleep and avoiding                                                                                      |
| 01:15:19   | rim and you got to avoid rim too.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:15:22   | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:15:23   | Of course.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:15:24   | That's right.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:25   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:26   | So I have a nap time shortcut that start, it does a couple of things.                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:30   | It starts my nap timer, which for me these days is 29 minutes.                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:33   | It used to be 22.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:15:34   | I've extended it to 29.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:36   | I'm still tweaking that.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:37   | That might, 29 might be too long.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:15:39   | But that's just for me.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:40   | You can, you can choose yours.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:42   | It turns on do not disturb on my phone.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:45   | It then gets my, my wifi network name and if it, if I am on my home network, it then                                                                                     |
| 01:15:53   | launches via a magic link, a [[Keyboard Maestro]] workflow on my Mac that turns off, it mutes                                                                                |
| 01:16:06   | my sound and turns off my screen.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:09   | So if I'm in my office, I tell it nap time, it sets the timer, it sets do not disturb                                                                                    |
| 01:16:14   | on my thing and then it turns off the screen on my Mac, it mutes the sound and then the                                                                                  |
| 01:16:19   | final step is it launches my white noise app that I listened to, uh, white noise while                                                                                   |
| 01:16:25   | I'm napping.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:26   | And all I have to do is say Siri nap time, uh, proceeded by the word hay and lay down                                                                                    |
| 01:16:31   | a nap and it's that it's, it's super simple and everything, it just works.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:36   | The only thing it doesn't do, and I suppose I could automate this now that I'm talking                                                                                   |
| 01:16:42   | about it is it does not unmute the sound on my Mac.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:46   | So there will be times where I will join a zoom call 10 minutes after I woke up from                                                                                     |
| 01:16:49   | a nap.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:50   | It's like, oh yeah, right.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:16:51   | I can't hear what those people are saying.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:16:52   | The problem with that is going to be, I mean, actually, no, it will be a problem because                                                                                 |
| 01:16:55   | you'll know 29 minutes after you've run, um, the, uh, the thing.                                                                                                         |
| 01:17:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:02   | No, I was, um, I'm, I'm just having a little play with it.                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:05   | Cause you'll know 29 minutes after.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:06   | So you can just use [[Keyboard Maestro]], um, have that same macro just keep running, like                                                                                   |
| 01:17:11   | how to have a pause and 29 minutes later on mute and I'm done.                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:14   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:16   | Do you have the, do not disturb automatically turn off at the end of your nap on your phone?                                                                             |
| 01:17:19   | I do not.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:17:20   | Um, I, I, I could, but I, I don't, that's, that's yet another tweak to make to this thing.                                                                               |
| 01:17:26   | So well, I, I was just, I was just recreating this, um, for, so I could put a link in the                                                                                |
| 01:17:30   | show notes, um, for people and I've just done that, um, uh, in, in the recreated one.                                                                                    |
| 01:17:35   | So I'll make sure that you get a copy of that.                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:37   | Perfect.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:38   | You can steal from it if you like.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:39   | I built this before we had sinkable focus modes between our, our various devices.                                                                                        |
| 01:17:44   | So there's, there's also some, some things that could be done, although muting the sound                                                                                 |
| 01:17:50   | on my Mac, like putting it, putting my Mac into do not disturb was not enough because                                                                                    |
| 01:17:56   | there are things on the Mac that will run, that will make noise, that don't necessarily                                                                                  |
| 01:18:01   | honour whatever do not disturb or focus mode my Mac happens to be in.                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:05   | So the, the muting of the, of the, the thing, even the dimming of the screen.                                                                                            |
| 01:18:09   | It really was a bonus I threw in.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:18:11   | If I didn't have to mute the Mac, I wouldn't have bothered with the magic link to keyboard                                                                               |
| 01:18:15   | maestro.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:16   | But, but yeah, those magic links, not only can [[Keyboard Maestro]] trigger them, but keyboard                                                                               |
| 01:18:20   | maestro has its own little web server in it so that it can be the recipient of them                                                                                      |
| 01:18:23   | so that it can then trigger things exactly like this.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:26   | So yeah, I love my nap time shortcut.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:28   | I might use it after we record this.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:30   | So, you know, why not, right?                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18:33   | I really think that you need to make a second one for the wakeup routine.                                                                                                |
| 01:18:37   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:38   | You create a custom nap time focus.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:42   | Then you could have an automation trigger when nap time focus ends and that could do even                                                                                |
| 01:18:47   | more magic for you.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:48   | Like it would start playing buddy rich drum fills and like, you know, just like celebrate                                                                                |
| 01:18:52   | it man.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:18:53   | You just had a nap.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:56   | You win.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:57   | That's right.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18:58   | Oh, I like it.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:18:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:19:00   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:19:01   | Cool.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:19:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:19:03   | The last time I tried that, that automation, I have now installed the beta courtesy of                                                                                   |
| 01:19:06   | Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:19:08   | It's still not working consistently for me when you turn a focus mode offer on triggering                                                                                |
| 01:19:13   | a shortcut.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:19:14   | That is an advertised feature that has not been working very well.                                                                                                       |
| 01:19:17   | Are you getting any luck with that, Rose?                                                                                                                                |
| 01:19:21   | It seems to be working pretty well for me.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:19:23   | I've not had it not play music because the, so what I do when I connect my phone to CarPlay,                                                                             |
| 01:19:32   | it waits 30 seconds because CarPlay sometimes will magically resume what I was recently listening                                                                        |
| 01:19:36   | to and sometimes it doesn't.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:19:38   | So it waits 30 seconds, checks if audio is playing and if it's still connected to the                                                                                    |
| 01:19:42   | car because I had a couple of instances recently of I went out to the car to grab something                                                                              |
| 01:19:47   | and came back in within that 30 second window and my phone then starts playing music in                                                                                  |
| 01:19:50   | my pocket.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:19:51   | So checks if the audio output is CarPlay.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:19:54   | And then if it is, then it grabs whatever the playlist is that it's supposed to be grabbing                                                                              |
| 01:19:58   | right now and plays it and I have a secondary shortcut for figuring out what playlist I should                                                                           |
| 01:20:04   | want based on what week of the year it is for things like Christmas music and stuff                                                                                      |
| 01:20:07   | like that.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:20:08   | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:20:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:10   | I've got a whole bunch of them set on me triggering podcast mode, like if I go into, if I'm making                                                                       |
| 01:20:15   | a podcast, I limit who can interrupt me and all that and it's supposed to trigger a shortcut                                                                             |
| 01:20:20   | that allows me to choose what show I'm recording, set timers and do a bunch of other stuff.                                                                              |
| 01:20:25   | And that is still not working for me, but I'll need to maybe, I'll need to take a look                                                                                   |
| 01:20:29   | at it.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:30   | Maybe I'm, maybe there's some user error involved.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:20:33   | There's definitely some finnicky-ness with you need to make sure that your phone is unlocked                                                                              |
| 01:20:37   | and that you're not in control centre if it's going to pop up and ask you to do things,                                                                                  |
| 01:20:42   | which is a bit tricky.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:20:43   | Like I found the best successes with things that can run entirely without your, your interaction                                                                         |
| 01:20:47   | with it, because if it's without your interaction, then it does just do the thing, which is great.                                                                       |
| 01:20:53   | What do you think about those focus modes, Dave?                                                                                                                         |
| 01:20:55   | We did recently a show on it, but are you using them?                                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:57   | I am, you know, when iOS 15 was in beta, John asked me on Mac Geek Hub, so what about focus                                                                              |
| 01:21:05   | modes?                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:06   | Cause I was using iOS 15's beta.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:21:07   | I'm like, I don't, like, I don't think they're, I don't think they're all they're cracked                                                                                |
| 01:21:10   | up to be.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:21:11   | I, I was definitely wrong about that.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:21:12   | I love focus modes.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:15   | In fact, as you were talking about this, I created a podcast focus mode that is, does                                                                                    |
| 01:21:19   | exactly what, what you both described so that it limits the number of people and which people                                                                            |
| 01:21:24   | can interrupt me and, you know, those various things.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:21:27   | But I am not yet running Monterey on my podcast machine.                                                                                                                 |
| 01:21:31   | This I have a personas audio interface up here and all of the things are up to date                                                                                      |
| 01:21:36   | and would theoretically work with Monterey, but I always, I just wait on, on this particular                                                                             |
| 01:21:42   | machine.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:21:43   | However, focus mode will be the catalyst to me upgrading to Monterey here much faster                                                                                    |
| 01:21:48   | than I usually would.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:21:50   | Basically it's about a week before WWDC is when this machine gets the current upgrade                                                                                    |
| 01:21:57   | and I think it's going to be January.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:21:59   | So, so we'll be about six months ahead of schedule.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:22:02   | In addition to focus mode though, I created a, or in addition to podcast mode, I created                                                                                 |
| 01:22:07   | a bunch of different focus modes and I'm finding the one that I'm using more often than not                                                                              |
| 01:22:12   | is the one that I call nuclear.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:22:15   | It's not about the nuclear option.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:22:17   | Good, good.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:22:18   | I was nervous.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:22:19   | It's about my, yes, it's about my nuclear family and it's, you know, those times where                                                                                   |
| 01:22:23   | I want to be, you know, I want my family to be able to, to contact me, but, but probably                                                                                 |
| 01:22:28   | not so much anybody else and, you know, my, yeah, my daughter was flying to Italy recently                                                                               |
| 01:22:34   | and doing a red eye and it was like, okay, like I definitely need sleep tonight and so                                                                                   |
| 01:22:40   | I don't want to, you know, leave my phone just not on do not disturb or sleep mode all                                                                                   |
| 01:22:46   | night, but I, I do want her to be able to interrupt us if, you know, if, if something                                                                                    |
| 01:22:52   | goes wrong with her connections or whatever.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:22:55   | And so I put it on nuclear mode and it was like, okay, I can sleep easy.                                                                                                 |
| 01:22:58   | My phone, you know, I even put the speaker on on my phone so that I would, you know,                                                                                     |
| 01:23:02   | have a great chance of waking me up and I felt totally confident going to sleep and                                                                                      |
| 01:23:07   | it was like, yeah, no problem.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:23:08   | I, my phone will interrupt me, but only for the people that I've chosen.                                                                                                 |
| 01:23:12   | And that's where it really obviously gets valuable.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:23:15   | I'm, I'm eager to listen to your focus mode episode.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:23:18   | I have not.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:23:19   | And so I'm sure there are things like I have learned in this episode from you that I am                                                                                  |
| 01:23:23   | not doing with the tools that I have available.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:25   | I have no doubt.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:23:27   | I will learn things from that prior episode or from whatever episode that was in relation                                                                                |
| 01:23:31   | to when this one comes out.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:23:32   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:23:33   | Well, you can also hack the do not disturb the built in do not disturb because that's                                                                                    |
| 01:23:37   | kind of what might do not disturb is your version of nuclear.                                                                                                            |
| 01:23:40   | I made exceptions and do not disturb for the nuclear family as well.                                                                                                     |
| 01:23:45   | I know, you know, when you're, when you're a dad, like you will always take that call,                                                                                   |
| 01:23:51   | you know, you will, you always want it to come through.                                                                                                                  |
| 01:23:53   | And usually it's like, I need the car keys and $20, but sometimes it's not that.                                                                                         |
| 01:23:59   | And you want to make sure that that time you are available, you know.                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:02   | It's true.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:24:03   | Although when I'm podcasting, like right now, two members of my family are out doing a thing                                                                             |
| 01:24:07   | that is, is important to them.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:24:09   | And they are telling the other two members of us about it.                                                                                                               |
| 01:24:12   | And if my phone, my phone was not in do not disturb when we started this.                                                                                                |
| 01:24:17   | And they started this right about when we started talking about shortcuts, which requires                                                                                |
| 01:24:22   | me to have my phone open.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:24:23   | And so I happily put do not disturb on, which keeps all people from interrupting me.                                                                                     |
| 01:24:29   | And I am okay with that decision.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:24:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:31   | So what I've done with do not disturb, because do not disturb as well as the, the sleep focus                                                                            |
| 01:24:36   | mode.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:37   | I believe you can do this there.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:24:38   | Say allowed notifications, people none, but you can then say also allow calls from.                                                                                      |
| 01:24:44   | And that by default, I set to my family for both sleep and my regular do not disturb.                                                                                    |
| 01:24:49   | Because honestly, if my mom calls me at two o'clock in the morning, I want to know and                                                                                   |
| 01:24:52   | be answering the phone, whatever it is, because either something's weird because she's usually                                                                           |
| 01:24:58   | fast asleep by then.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:25:00   | And you know, she's somehow managing to dial my phone, whatever, or something's actually                                                                                 |
| 01:25:06   | wrong.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:25:07   | And so I'd much rather just be available for those situations.                                                                                                           |
| 01:25:09   | And so I specifically say allow calls from, I don't put the people in the favourites,                                                                                     |
| 01:25:15   | because this means that if they call me, it'll come through.                                                                                                             |
| 01:25:17   | If they don't call me, then I presume it's not that urgent.                                                                                                              |
| 01:25:21   | I've done exactly the same thing.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:25:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:25:24   | Calls, calls will, from my favourites, will get through no matter what.                                                                                                   |
| 01:25:27   | And then that's it.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:25:28   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:25:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:25:30   | I changed the group in some of these because favourites includes friends and other people                                                                                 |
| 01:25:33   | in certain cases.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:25:35   | So I do just have favourite family as a, as a group.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:25:38   | That's actually a really smart, yeah, smart tweak to that.                                                                                                               |
| 01:25:41   | I might, I might spend a little time and then make those two changes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:25:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:25:46   | That's good.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:25:47   | I'll say the problem for me is in addition to thinking their phones are charged at 20%,                                                                                  |
| 01:25:50   | my children also do not believe in making telephone calls.                                                                                                               |
| 01:25:53   | That's against some sort of child religion that they are a part of.                                                                                                      |
| 01:25:57   | So I'm only going to hear from them by text.                                                                                                                             |
| 01:26:01   | Even if it's a super emergency.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:03   | I guess they would call me with a super emergency, but it's very, we've had calls in super emergencies                                                                   |
| 01:26:08   | for sure.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:26:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:11   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:12   | Dave, I want to thank you for coming on.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:13   | We got a lot more to cover, so we're going to have to have you back at some point.                                                                                       |
| 01:26:16   | In fact, next time you come, you can tell us how you've mastered Bunch because I can                                                                                     |
| 01:26:20   | totally see you going down that rabbit hole and it's totally our fault.                                                                                                  |
| 01:26:24   | So that's cool.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:25   | This was, yeah, this was, this was not something I needed in my life, except I need it in my                                                                             |
| 01:26:30   | life.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:31   | Yeah, I get it.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:32   | It's incredibly good for the, you know, like you've had, like you're starting recording                                                                                  |
| 01:26:36   | a podcast, right?                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:26:37   | I'm going to clear the decks.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:26:38   | I'm going to start recording the podcast.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:26:40   | It clears the decks.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:26:41   | I use Safari, sorry, AppleScript to open a new Safari window.                                                                                                           |
| 01:26:45   | So I clear the decks.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:26:46   | I hide all the applications that I do want to keep.                                                                                                                      |
| 01:26:48   | And then I hide all of the other Safari.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:50   | I hide everything and then tell application Safari to make new document.                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:55   | And I get a brand new empty Safari window, which has got spaced for all the links and                                                                                    |
| 01:26:59   | everything that need to be opened and maintained during the show, which is really, really,                                                                               |
| 01:27:02   | really useful.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:27:03   | So that certainly makes my life easier.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:05   | As someone who does this stuff in [[Keyboard Maestro]], I'd be really curious to hear what                                                                                   |
| 01:27:08   | you think about it, like in comparison, because it's really another way to do that set up                                                                                |
| 01:27:12   | stuff you're doing in [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:14   | Right.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:27:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:27:16   | I know I did take a look at it and I see it like from a 10,000 foot view, how you're                                                                                     |
| 01:27:21   | editing this text file that sort of scripts all these things together and ties it all                                                                                    |
| 01:27:25   | in.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:27:26   | Like, yeah, because there are things in [[Keyboard Maestro]] where they're either not doable                                                                                 |
| 01:27:30   | because the path doesn't exist or more likely they're doable, but you have to jump through                                                                               |
| 01:27:36   | three different hoops to just get to the one that you wanted, which is similar, which                                                                                    |
| 01:27:41   | is sort of how my chapters and timestamps thing works, like calculating the time, took                                                                                   |
| 01:27:47   | a little bit of, oh, I see, that's how I have to do it here, okay.                                                                                                       |
| 01:27:52   | And so things like, not necessarily that, but I can see we're a bunch with its simplicity                                                                                |
| 01:27:59   | allows more flexibility, but takes a little bit more of a learning curve.                                                                                                |
| 01:28:04   | Do you do window management with your setups in [[Keyboard Maestro]], like you put it on the                                                                                 |
| 01:28:07   | left side or the right side or whatever?                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:28:10   | You know, I don't, because I use Stay from Cordless Dog, every app that I have has its                                                                                   |
| 01:28:18   | place on my screen and it doesn't matter what my workflow is.                                                                                                            |
| 01:28:22   | Like I always know that, you know, [[Audio Hijack]] is going to be over there, Mail is going to                                                                              |
| 01:28:26   | be over here if it's running, Safari is going to be here, those sorts of things.                                                                                         |
| 01:28:29   | So I use Stay from Cordless Dog to put things in their place when it launches, whether I                                                                                 |
| 01:28:36   | launch it manually or [[Keyboard Maestro]] does it as part of its setup.                                                                                                     |
| 01:28:41   | So that's how I manage that.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:28:42   | I did not know about this app.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:28:44   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:28:45   | Oh my gosh.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:28:46   | This is perfect for certain, oh my gosh.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:28:49   | Thank you, Dave.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:28:50   | You're welcome.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:28:51   | I did not know about this app.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:28:52   | So I use [[Moom]] for all of my window management, just because I can say like, hey, like here                                                                               |
| 01:28:58   | is a set of windows that I would use for doing, for example, recording automators, I've got                                                                              |
| 01:29:03   | a set for that and it puts certain windows in certain places, but there are other applications                                                                           |
| 01:29:07   | that I just always want to be in the exact same place all the darn time, and I never                                                                                     |
| 01:29:11   | want them to not be there.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:29:13   | And so I'm going to be grabbing this one.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:29:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:16   | No, Stay is key.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:29:17   | I love it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:29:19   | It's simple, single-purpose app, and if it's not running on my Mac, I know it right away.                                                                                |
| 01:29:25   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:26   | Super helpful, especially if you've got multiple screens, because Mac OS isn't always the best                                                                           |
| 01:29:31   | at remembering to put something over there.                                                                                                                              |
| 01:29:34   | If it's supposed to always live on the secondary screen, a lot of times it just comes back                                                                               |
| 01:29:38   | to the middle and it's like, no, no, no, no, over there, please.                                                                                                         |
| 01:29:42   | So Dave, where do people find you?                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:29:44   | We're going to put links in the show for Mac Geek Gab and Mac Observer.                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:48   | Who are you on Twitter?                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:29:49   | I'm Dave at Dave Hamilton on Twitter.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:29:52   | I am at Hamilton.Dave on Facebook.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:29:54   | If anybody wants to find me there, of course, without the at sign, but at the slash and                                                                                  |
| 01:29:57   | the things before it, you'll figure it out.                                                                                                                              |
| 01:30:00   | And yeah, MacGeek Gab.com is a good, that will get you to wherever that resolves to and that's                                                                             |
| 01:30:07   | the right place.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:30:08   | All right.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:30:09   | Well, thanks so much for sharing all this automation stuff.                                                                                                              |
| 01:30:12   | I know that you love doing this and I was really eager to hear some of the tricks you've                                                                                 |
| 01:30:16   | got up your sleeve.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:30:17   | And I like that there's a good mix here.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:30:19   | There's some very complex and some very simple, but you're using them for everything.                                                                                    |
| 01:30:23   | Well, that's the idea is just using it.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:30:25   | So yeah, thanks for having me and thanks for having the conversation.                                                                                                    |
| 01:30:27   | I've learned a ton being here.                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:30:29   | So this has been great.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:30:30   | I love it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:30:31   | Thanks for having me.                                                                                                                                                    |

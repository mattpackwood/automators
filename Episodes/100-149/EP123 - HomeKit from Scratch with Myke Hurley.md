| 01:45      | Oh, I also like to say just to lay also like a ground rule here with you two, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 01:55      | I'm not doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:56      | All right, it's home kit only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:58      | We're going to get to why on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:00      | Yeah, we're going to get to why on that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:02      | because I have home assistant and everything is still in the home app,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 02:05      | but yeah, there are good reasons for both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:07      | So we'll definitely get around to talking about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02:10      | And the good news is there have been so many new home kit products coming out all the time                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:14      | that there are going to be versions of something for you,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:18      | even if it's not exactly the same as the things that maybe David talks about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 02:22      | with the Lutron Caseta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:24      | That's one that springs to mind is definitely not available over here in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 02:27      | But there's plenty that we can talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:30      | I feel like on that spectrum of home assistant to home kit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 02:34      | we're like the three bears and I'm in the direct centre of the two of you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:38      | So we can talk about that if you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 02:42      | You're the Goldilocks of home automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:44      | Yeah, there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 02:46      | But what is your experience with it, Mike?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 02:49      | I mean, when we first talked, I got the impression you really don't have a lot of history                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:53      | with doing home automation stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:55      | No, I have been in the most basic kind of home automation really over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 03:03      | You know, like everybody, I got an Amazon Echo at one point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:07      | That is still an important part of our home system because my wife just used to doing that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 03:13      | and wants to continue using the Amazon Echo that we have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:18      | But really, for her, that's just to control the lights in the house,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:22      | which is fine because we've been very much on the Philips Hue train.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 03:25      | And that's kind of really been the maximum for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:28      | I've had Philips Hue lights and some lamps and also down the road,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:33      | I picked up a couple of those Meross power strips,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 03:37      | which are just like one of the best smart home products I've ever come across.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 03:41      | So simple, works so well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:43      | And it's just you've got like four power adapters and some USB on a strip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 03:48      | and you can turn them all on or off or you can break them up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 03:51      | and put them on individual time like automations and stuff like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 03:55      | And so really, that's kind of been it for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 03:58      | It's just lights and some basic power stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 04:01      | This stuff is harder and more time consuming to implement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:05      | than we give credit for on the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 04:07      | Like even me, I've got now a room that I control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:11      | You know, I've got this little studio I built out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 04:13      | So I no longer have the excuse that I have to make something that will work for my wife                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 04:17      | and I could like go nuts in here and it's taken me a while to kind of get it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:22      | And it's still not exactly the way I want it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:25      | I do think home automation is kind of an evolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 04:28      | And the other thing I would ask is how do you like keep up with it, Mike?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:32      | I mean, are you like somebody who follows the, you know, the latest updates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 04:36      | with like all the changes in the underlying architecture that Apple has or is this something?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:41      | Are you more kind of like at the consumer level of this stuff at this point?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 04:45      | I would say it's probably somewhere in the middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 04:47      | I mean, I keep up with it a little bit more than I quite a bit more than I used to actually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 04:52      | Like I follow a couple of like home kit YouTubers now,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 04:56      | which is the thing that I wasn't doing until we moved because I wanted to kind of like build up my knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 05:02      | Like Shane Whatley, who I think you had a Mac Power users before, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:06      | Yeah, Shane's my favourite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 05:08      | Like I think he does a really good job of like breaking it down nice and simply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:13      | And is also basically all home kit focused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:19      | And then I also follow automate your life, which is another YouTuber.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05:24      | And then there is I think home kit authority, which I believe is UK based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 05:29      | Yeah, home kit authority. They're like the three, the three YouTube channels that I follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:33      | Home kit authority is UK based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:35      | So I can get a kind of like a broad spectrum of what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:40      | And, you know, I don't watch all of their videos, but if they've got a video on something like a particular type of home automation that I'm interested in, I'll watch them.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 05:47      | Oh, and also, oh, who was it that Eric Welander?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:51      | Yeah, that's a good one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:53      | He'd stopped posting for a while and then returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:56      | And so Eric Eric, I really like his talks too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 05:59      | So yeah, those are those are all good folks who got a lot of and I kind of like that you're going into this with limitations on what you're willing to do because that kind of gives you a framework to work in and like when you're buying hardware and things like that.                                                                                                           |
| 06:13      | Now, have you kept up with all the stuff with matter?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:15      | Is that a thing that's on your radar?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:18      | Yeah, I actually got really excited about matter and I still it still clearly has a ways to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:24      | Right. I think that I don't think I've read about any matter rollout that didn't have some kind of problem so far or some kind of delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:34      | And to be honest, I think that's fine for me with I think what matter is ultimately going to do because, you know, as I'm sure this is the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 06:43      | No, it being kind of built realistically on on Apple's home spec means that there will just continue to be more products that are available in the home app than there ever were before.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:53      | Just just because they support matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 06:55      | So I am pleased about that kind of going into the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 06:59      | I haven't had to and have no intention to like change or upgrade any of my existing devices to do matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 07:06      | Like I have some Aqara devices will get into that later on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:09      | I'm not planning on doing the matter migration because I just used them in home, but I do feel like going into the not too distant future more and more products will start to come on the market.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:20      | That will be great for me because I want to be all home focused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:25      | And I think now actually might be a good time to dig into that a little bit because, you know, you have your grand rules of it has to be in in home kit, which is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:36      | But why are why are you not interested in Homebridge and home assistant, especially when they could allow something to be in both home kit and available on the echo ecosystem, which, you know, would be useful for a Dina.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 07:53      | Well, does it the echo thing is only ever really going to be able to control the lights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:57      | That's kind of like the the limit that we're putting on it because plus as well, I'm hoping to try and continue moving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:03      | I want to continue down the path of let's get rid of this so I don't want to make the echo to attractive as a prospect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:11      | Don't give it more superpowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:13      | Yeah, I don't want to do that, especially because my hope is that Apple will bring some kind of device to the market that will have a screen like we use the echo show.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:22      | And I would like to be able to replace the Amazon echo show that we have with some kind of home kit product like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:30      | But for me, I've had some experience with Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:35      | I ran Homebridge here at my studio and just all of a sudden one day, the server clock reset itself and hose the entire thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 08:42      | Yeah, I don't know why that happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:44      | But this is kind of the thing that I do not want to deal with, right, especially because this is my home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:50      | I want to be able to set up lots of home automation stuff and hot smart home products around the home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:56      | I don't want to have to give myself debugging and I don't want to have to get myself into a situation where a firmware updated and now it's not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:10      | And now, you know, I just don't I want to be able to stay as kind of like vanilla as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 09:15      | And I think that home will allow me to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:17      | That's fair enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:18      | I found for me, like the reason why I have home assistant in my life now is because when home kit doesn't do something that you expect,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:26      | you're just sitting in the dark, possibly quite literally or in my case, three o'clock in the morning in the light because it turned all lights on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:35      | I turn them off and it turned them on again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09:37      | I turn them off and it turned them on again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09:38      | It turned out it was a bug with the location stuff and it kept assuming that I was coming home because and this happened again recently, actually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 09:45      | My iPhone GPS just went haywire and it just bounced me in and out and in and out and in and out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:52      | And because it's home kit, I just couldn't see anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 09:55      | But in home assistant, I have the logs, which is one of the reasons why I've ended up using it and sharing the things into home that I want to be able to control either using Siri or the control centre.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10:05      | And I can empathise a little bit because like at the moment I have a scene set up like a good night scene and I press the button and everything works as I expect,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10:13      | but it says failed every time and I don't know what's failing because it all seems to be working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10:18      | And so, but there's no way for me to get that information from the home apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10:23      | Like I see that part for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10:25      | I do think home assistant has a certain degree of fiddliness to it, but it definitely gives you more information and more power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10:32      | You know, like the one I talked about on a recent show is like I have a hearing problem where the alarm on the refrigerator door matches the frequency of my my tinnitus so I can't hear it go off.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10:44      | And now like I can turn lights on in the house red and do things when that alarm goes off with with home assistant where I was unable to do that reliably with with home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10:55      | But as you're getting started in this stuff, I still think you're doing it right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 10:58      | I think mastering home kit and just making that work for you well and just waiting until you start to see where you're hitting a ceiling, you know, just use home kit and see how far it gets you.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11:11      | And I think for a lot of people, home kit is going to be far enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11:15      | The answer will be far enough that Rosemary is, you know, you're an Uber automator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:20      | I mean, you make a podcast about it and and of course you're going to want to take it to the next level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:25      | I want to take it next level to not as far as you do probably, but I'm always interested in in the limits of my technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11:32      | So, you know, I'm I'm a home assistant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11:34      | I have one I play with it, but I think getting started in this stuff, you probably shouldn't go to that level immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11:40      | I think getting some switches and some lights and some things that work with home kit and seeing how those work for you is a great way to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:50      | And then when you start to be frustrated either by inherent problems with home kit or limitations, then you can start exploring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:58      | And the one point I would make is home assistant is not Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:02      | Home assistant is way more user friendly than home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12:06      | In my in my experience, but I think we are going to the hard bed immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:13      | So let's start with soft one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:15      | Well, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:16      | And I think I think one of the first things that we should talk about actually, Mike, is that feeling scene that you've got because, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12:22      | figuring out what's wrong in home kit is really an awkward puzzle to solve at any time to be clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 12:30      | But there is a great app called Home Lock by Aaron Pierce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:35      | And I don't know if you've run into any of his other apps before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12:38      | I'm using all of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 12:39      | This is the one I'm not using.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12:41      | Well, this is the one that you need because this can try to log home kit stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12:47      | Now, there are some limitations like on iOS, the app has to actively be open and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12:53      | So like you'll have to trigger it from another iOS device and then like watch the one that you're running the log on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12:58      | But if you're on the Mac, then you can just, you know, run home log on the Mac and then go and check afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:04      | And that fingers crossed will tell you what the problem is with this scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:09      | And it might be that you just need to delete it and recreate it, which is frustrating and weird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:14      | And sometimes home kit needs that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 13:16      | But Home Lock is definitely going to be, you know, a great tool in your arsenal to help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13:21      | Why is this thing not happening or failing or doing something when it's when I didn't think it should be great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 13:28      | That's a fantastic tip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 13:29      | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:30      | I have downloaded it already because I use one of the things I set myself as like a goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13:35      | When I set, started setting up the new home products, because I do have now more products than I had in our old apartment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:43      | I was like, all right, everything's going in Home Pass, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 13:46      | Which is the app that lets you store all of the codes in case you need to like re-add something to home kit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:53      | but it's stuck behind a wardrobe or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 13:56      | So everything's going in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 13:58      | So that, you know, that's been good so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 14:00      | But yeah, I hadn't, I saw Home Lock and like couldn't work out what I would need it for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 14:06      | And I didn't put two and two together with the issue that I'm having.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:09      | So yeah, I'm going to give this one a go today actually and see if I can work it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:13      | Well, I'll cross my fingers for you because it would be really good to nail down the problem because I think that's the thing where,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 14:20      | you know, home automation doesn't work for a lot of people because part of the problem is they're not necessarily automating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 14:26      | They're giving themselves the ability to talk to a speaker instead of press a button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:30      | But what you're used to doing is pressing the button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 14:32      | So it's more frustrating to talk to a speaker to do the thing instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 14:36      | And the other thing is it doesn't work and you don't know why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:40      | And so solving those problems is definitely the key to good home automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:45      | And a shocking amount of time in home kit, the solution is just to delete it and recreate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 14:50      | And it is a little disturbing how often that fixes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 14:55      | That's just computers though, you know what I mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:00      | I was joking, [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]], about he has to watch the IT crowd, you know, on MP impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:05      | Now I have a thing with him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15:07      | The next time it comes up on the show, if he hasn't watched it, he has to pay $100 to St. Jude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15:12      | He's not going to watch it just to give them the money to be clear because this is Stephen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:15      | The whole theme of the show is like, have you tried turning it off and on again?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:20      | Yep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:22      | So there is one other thing that I wanted to note before, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:27      | we dive too much into home kit and all the cool things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:31      | And that is backing up home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 15:33      | And so that when you have to like delete stuff and then make it again, you can do that more easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:38      | And that is, there's a couple of apps that do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 15:40      | The one that I use for this is controller for home kit because it allows you to create advanced home automations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:46      | But it can also back up your home kit and then restore it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 15:50      | And this can be really useful if, for example, you have, I don't know, say you have a white light bulb in your hallway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 15:58      | and you decide that actually you want a white ambient light bulb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:01      | So you replace the light bulb, but then you need to hook it into all the automations that you already had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16:07      | Well, you can actually like, you know, restore a backup and actually say,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:11      | no, like this bulb is now this thing over here, like swap those in place and it will do that for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 16:17      | And so it's a very useful little tool for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16:20      | So I'll make sure link for that one is in the show notes as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:24      | Because yeah, like there's a lot that you can do with home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16:28      | So I think I think folks will really enjoy those links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16:59      | The team over at Electric knows small businesses maybe like yours face these challenges and that's why they've solved this problem for you by operating as your IT department.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 17:25      | you can build that empire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 17:32      | Plus you get a really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:36      | Look, you're listening to this show, you know about automation, you know about IT, you can do a lot of this stuff for your team,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17:42      | but you shouldn't be doing it for your team because if you want to make the business go to the next level, you need to be working on the business, not the IT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 18:17      | And our thanks to Electric for their support of the automators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:23      | Okay, Mike, so you've already bought some gear. What have you got on your desk now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18:28      | All right, so one of the main things for me was an alarm system of some type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18:38      | We had previously been using a product that I don't think many people will remember.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 18:44      | It was called the Canary. Do you remember this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:46      | Yep, yep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 18:47      | We'd used that thing forever, loved it, but I was like, there were two things that happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18:53      | I think it's time to upgrade to something new, because I also wanted to have more than just the one camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:58      | It was like an all-in-one camera alarm solution thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 19:02      | But also, because we moved, we needed to change, we needed to get it back on the new Wi-Fi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:09      | And it wasn't working, so I had to reset it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 19:13      | And the way that you do it in the app is by plugging in, they had like a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack cable,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19:19      | which you plug into your phone and then a mini USB into the back of the phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 19:25      | And that was how it did like firmware updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 19:27      | And well, I was like, I need like four dongles to make this work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:32      | So there was like, this little guy is going to be retired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 19:35      | Plus, I'd been doing some research anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 19:37      | And I went with the alarm system made by Abode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:42      | Are you familiar with them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:45      | Because what I was looking for was a couple of things that they offered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:49      | We have their kind of, they have a couple of products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 19:52      | They have like an all-in-one camera and then they have like an alarm system product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 19:57      | And we got the alarm system product, which has the ability to tie in a bunch of sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 20:05      | Not all, but a lot of their sensor products can then just be seen in HomeKit, which I liked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:10      | But the main thing was I wanted something which was visible in HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:14      | So it could have some automations attached to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:16      | If that's something I want to do in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 20:18      | But also I wanted a home monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:21      | So I wanted to have both because I know I could have gone down the route with kind of building my own system, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:27      | Like there are, you know, you could go, I guess, like a car, I have a bunch of stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:31      | But I also wanted a, okay, if we don't answer this notification, someone's going to call us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:39      | And if we don't answer someone's calling the police, like I wanted that part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:43      | Like we had that with Canary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:45      | And so that was what after doing a bunch of research, I settled on a bode for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 20:51      | And I've been, I would say pretty happy with my experience with them so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:55      | I had a couple of issues at the beginning that they resolved for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:59      | The support team was very helpful because it also has battery and cell backup,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:04      | which is also something that I wanted because I have a ring system at my studio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 21:08      | And I really like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:09      | Like I've lost internet multiple times in the studio and it just connects to a LTE backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:14      | And it's like, oh, this is really good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:16      | So like I wanted to have that home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:17      | That wasn't working for me initially, but they got it fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:20      | And I've been, yeah, I've been rid, their door and window sensors are pretty simple and nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21:26      | And they speak to HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:28      | Their cameras only work in the app, the abode app, but I'm kind of fine with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:34      | I like that we would have maybe one or two abode cameras so that the abode people could see them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:40      | And then we would also, we're also, I'm also thinking of having some other cameras in the home that would just be in HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21:46      | So I kind of would have this two-tiered system of like, this is for break-ins and this is just to check everything's okay in the house kind of thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21:54      | As my tears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:55      | So I do actually want some recommendations from you both on cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:59      | I know that that question today is more loaded than it was in the past because I think everyone's previous recommendation is like, we don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:08      | So I mean, I think it really depends because I'm personally still fairly happy to recommend you fee as long as you're using a HomeKit secure video one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:17      | Because those notifications that get sent to you with a snapshot and so on, that's being done them by Apple and the Apple HomeKit secure video system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:26      | Rather than the you fee app and you fees stuff, which I like this is one of the things where to me as a developer, it was fairly obvious that that image, the still was being sent from like a server because it's really difficult to point to an image that's stored on a home network from, you know, elsewhere in the world when IP addresses are constantly changing and stuff. |
| 22:47      | But with that not really being, you know, the point, you know, if you're using HomeKit secure video, anything, as long as you trust Apple is going to be fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:57      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:58      | The trick is to stick with the HomeKit secure video stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:01      | And I have to say, like the you fee stuff, because it goes on sale so often, you can pick it up quite cheaply and like give it a try.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23:07      | And especially if you buy it from Amazon with the 30 day return policy, if you turn, if it turns out that you do hate it, then you can return it and try and get something else.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:15      | But I mean, I don't really have any experience with any other indoor cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:20      | Yeah, I was really impressed by the you fee stuff when I visited end or studios late last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23:26      | And Dave had the cameras that like move the pan and tilt ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:30      | I bought one, but I never set it up because I bought it and then everything exploded and then I wasn't sure if I should be using them anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:37      | Yeah, the trick is just set it up in in HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:40      | Like you don't need the you fee app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:41      | Don't bother.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:42      | I don't want the you fee app like I always just wanted it to just be in HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 23:46      | That was kind of all I was looking for because they're more for like just a quick snapshot of how's the home is kind of what I'm thinking of there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 23:53      | All right, so that's that's what I'll go with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:55      | And just to, I guess, update my you fee situation is I have my you fee cameras connected to HomeKit that are indoor facing that are not with a place called indoor studios.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 24:07      | That's confusing that they're inside the house in the home facing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:11      | Those are all in Apple HomeKit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 24:13      | So you you fee never sees those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 24:15      | And theoretically, they don't see the other ones too, but I have several outdoor ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 24:19      | I have some of their floodlight cams and the doorbell cam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:22      | And that is on a going to local storage using that you fee system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:28      | Yeah, it's an update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 24:30      | I mean, I feel like, you know, the old saying never tribute to malice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 24:34      | What can be attributed to incompetence?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24:37      | I feel like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 24:39      | I mean, I'm not on the inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 24:40      | So I don't know for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:41      | But that really seems to be the story of what happened with you fee that they made some mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 24:47      | And then they aggravated the problem by reacting and denying it when they shouldn't have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:53      | But they have publicly stated that they're having third parties audit their systems now and blah, blah, blah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:00      | But I don't like the idea of my camera is going to anybody's cloud except apples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:05      | So I don't use any system like even like the abode system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:10      | I'm tempted because I don't have an alarm system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:12      | But again, it's like, do I really want other people to be able to see footage inside my house?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 25:17      | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 25:18      | You know, I mean, you don't have to have cameras with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:21      | Like you can have the security monitoring with door sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:26      | So if the door sensor got tripped that I believe that would be enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 25:30      | I don't I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:31      | Maybe they do require you to have a camera so they can check, but I haven't seen that anywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25:35      | But the finish the story with you fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 25:38      | So I haven't changed them out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 25:40      | But you know, the ones inside are all connected to home kit and the ones outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:44      | In fact, my home kit cameras and Mike, you may want to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 25:47      | Home kits got a great setting that says only turn the cameras on when you leave the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:53      | So I don't my cameras don't record except when I leave the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:57      | So and they're, they're actually not, they're not even looking except when I leave the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 26:02      | Oh, I do also have, I have that completely forgot about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 26:05      | I have an Aqara camera hub, the G2H because I wanted to get a hub and camera and I have it set that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 26:12      | So it's just pointing at the back door right now because I don't know where to put it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 26:15      | Like eventually we'll find it's on home, but it is set to like this only comes on when we leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:21      | And I found that that Apple's geofence is more reliable than not reliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:28      | It's like smaller than the above geofence because I have that to set and unset on a geofence too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:34      | But that, that radius is a little wider, but it doesn't really make a difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:38      | They're not massively different, but I've been pretty happy with the Aqara hub camera because I needed a hub anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:44      | And so I figured, well, why not also make it a camera?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 26:47      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 26:48      | And that's definitely a good option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:50      | Did you look at any other vendors when you decided on a boat or I mean, what led you to them to begin with?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 26:56      | I mean, really it was about the home kit support and I didn't find any home kit kind of focused product that had the monitoring other than them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:10      | There were like other home kit products that didn't have the monitoring or there were other products that had even greater features and better monitoring, but they weren't in home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27:19      | And so it was kind of really was like, this one will do for what I'm looking for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:24      | I watched a bunch of reviews online and they were good to okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 27:28      | And to be honest, that's all I would ever really expect from a product like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:32      | Like I'm never expecting it to like blow my mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:35      | And honestly, neither do I want it to like I want it to be pretty simple in its feature set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:41      | And that works out great for me, you know, and they had all of the things I was looking for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:46      | They have, they also do their own flood sense, like leak sensors, or do I have the Aqara one, which I prefer, but I tried one of the ones that are both does, but they also, you know, they have their own door and window sensors.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 27:59      | They have vibration sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 28:01      | They have keypads and thought that they felt like they had a very wide range of products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 28:07      | And they've actually added a wireless doorbell, which I bought, but haven't been able to get to work great yet because I want to put the, we have like a front garden with like a high gate and I want to put the doorbell on the gate.                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:22      | And I've yet to find something to give me a strong enough internet connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:26      | So like, that's like a long term project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 28:28      | Because what I really want is a home kit doorbell, which I think there are some products coming to the market soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:35      | And I think Aqara has one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 28:37      | And I'm kind of like, so the, the abode when I have it, but I'm not going to do any big work until I can maybe also try and get this Aqara one as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:44      | Because I want, I want, I want that to be in home kit, ideally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:47      | Yeah, I'm equally annoyed with UV on the doorbell because they, when I bought it, they, I think they had even said they were bringing home kit to it and they never did.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:56      | But the same time I've now had a doorbell cam for three years that I use all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:00      | So it's, it's kind of nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 29:02      | But it is interesting because I feel like that's something Rose and I haven't really explored too much on the show is the security system, automation angles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:12      | I mean, like you can with the Aqara stuff, they have speakers in some of their hubs where you can turn that effectively into an alarm system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:22      | But I haven't explored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:24      | And I don't know if you have Rose, like the, the monitoring connected systems like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:30      | So I haven't looked into this just because I live in a flat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 29:35      | And should any of this stuff go wrong?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:39      | I have five neighbours in my building.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 29:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:43      | And then like there are 40 flats here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:45      | So there'll probably be like 39 other flats that would really not be happy with it plus neighbouring houses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 29:50      | 100% accidentally saw the alarm on day two of having the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 29:53      | So like, and it's super loud is very, very loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 30:00      | And I will say, you know, I feel like especially for, for our audience, there is, you know, an inherent security part to this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 30:11      | Like someone is going to be able to see into your home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:14      | Like that is, and you live yourself open to that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30:17      | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30:18      | Like I'm aware of this and I'm okay enough with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:21      | You know, because I personally want that trade off for the worst kind of situation for me, which is that we are on vacation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:29      | Someone breaks into my home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:30      | Like, so I'm willing to take that, that potential risk, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 30:37      | For the security that it could provide me in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:43      | So yeah, which makes a lot of sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 30:45      | And like, I do have a bunch of security stuff and, you know, should somebody break in there will be photos which are emailed to me and my parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30:53      | And, you know, they get stored in Dropbox and a bunch of other places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30:57      | So, you know, there, there is stuff that happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:00      | But also like the only thing that happens should somebody break in is the lights won't turn on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:07      | Like, and that's, that's basically it because I do have, I have a doorbell chime, which is also a siren and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:14      | It can do things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:15      | But I realised that, you know, quite frankly, my, my better investment in, in time and my money was actually smart locks that will lock and definitely be locked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:25      | Because most people are, you know, if somebody is going to break in and steal something, it's because there's an opportunity to do it and it's easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31:31      | Not because they've been staking my place out and planning it for months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:36      | You know, like it's just statistically unlikely, especially where I live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:41      | So, yeah, I went, I went with the, the different approach of the lock will automatically lock when I close the door so that I don't have to worry about, you know, did I accidentally leave the door unlocked again?                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 31:53      | And these upload systems aren't super expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:56      | I'm looking now, you can, like, if you go, you get a 50% off if you go and buy the first day and then you're looking at around $250 or so for an average system and the monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:08      | Yeah, and I got some of this stuff on a Good Black Friday deal too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:11      | But I think even just generally, you know, I would say I've used this for a few months, like I wouldn't give it like a full-throated recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:18      | But so far, I've been very happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:21      | I found it to be reliable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:23      | It's doing all of the things that I would expect it to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 32:26      | And I've yet to hit something unexpected, you know, as you tend to these kinds of things, like it has been not any problem for me, which is kind of what I'm looking for in a product like this.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 32:37      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:38      | And the monitoring's $220 a year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:42      | If you're in the U.S., I don't know what it costs elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:45      | And that's with the 24-7 professional monitoring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:48      | So, I mean, that, I mean, we used to have a home security system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:51      | We paid a lot more than that for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:53      | So, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:54      | Yeah, over here in the UK, they've got two plans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:56      | It's $799 for the standard plan or $1399 for the pro plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 33:01      | And, yeah, the standard plan doesn't actually have a, actually neither of them have got contracts required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:08      | But the pro plan is the one that comes with the 4G set of the backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:11      | So, that's, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:13      | I think they are US, UK only right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33:16      | I think that's where they own the places that they operate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:18      | Well, that's one of the things that always concerns me about my home security is that our junction box is on the outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:24      | So, all my cool stuff here is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33:27      | But if somebody just went through all the fuses before they came in, none of it would work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:33      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:34      | So, that was like a big thing for me with getting the backup that it provides, both battery and cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:41      | So, what literal worst comes to worst, which is like someone who knows what they're doing, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:47      | Who would do that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 33:48      | It means I still am protected because it's still connected to all of the door sensors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 33:53      | Like, yes, the camera wouldn't work in that scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 33:56      | But if all the power is gone and one of the door sensors trigger, I feel pretty confident that I know what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 34:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:03      | That's a good combination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34:05      | If somebody really knows what they're doing and breaks into your place, you know, like you probably have bigger concerns and will have like a home security team as well as a home security system.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:15      | And outside that for me, it's currently just a bunch of headlights, some sensors I bought like listening to you too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:24      | And all in on the car for sensor stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 34:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:43      | Just nicer looking, more responsive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:45      | And the Eve one, I think I had to reset it three times, like just to get it to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:50      | I didn't even know what was going on with that thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:53      | Plus the price difference, like huge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:56      | So I went with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34:58      | And then I also have a selection of the Meross plug things kind of like all over the home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 35:05      | And also, I don't really count this in the home automation, but it is my home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 35:10      | We're all in on Sonos in our household for music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 35:14      | Is that just directly Sonos or do you have any of the symphonic speakers from IKEA dotted in there as well?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:20      | Just Sonos right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 35:22      | But I'm looking at some of this in finished stuff because we're looking to get some lamps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 35:27      | I was like, well, maybe I'll just in the guest room, I'll put one of those lamps in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:31      | But yeah, I haven't looked too deeply at those yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35:34      | But I know that I know that's very popular for good reason because it's a good way to bring more affordable Sonos products into the home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 35:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 35:43      | Yeah, like I have the, I don't have anywhere in my hallway really where I can put a speaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35:47      | So I have the picture frame in my hallway, which works out really well because it can also play like doorbell chimes and stuff like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 35:54      | And it's a nice central place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 36:14      | LinkedIn Jobs helps find the right people for your team faster and for free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 36:18      | Whenever I've been looking for a new job or being part of a team searching someone, I've known that it's really difficult to find out what it is you need to know about the candidate.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:27      | And even something as simple as a CV isn't simple because if a recruit is involved, they've probably rewritten it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 36:34      | So it's great to actually see what the person's written about themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:38      | It's so quick to create a free job post to LinkedIn, it literally just takes minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 36:43      | Then add your job and the purple hashtag hiring frame to your LinkedIn profile to spread the word that you're hiring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 36:48      | And simple tools like screening questions make it easy to focus on candidates with just the right skills and experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:53      | So you can quickly prioritise who you'd like to interview and hire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:56      | Meaning you can be sure to finish the year strong with the right team member on board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 37:01      | It's why small business rate LinkedIn Jobs number one in delivering quality hires versus leading competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 38:03      | but it's incredibly expensive and can only be installed by professionals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 38:36      | and I just put hue remotes in there because my lights, I don't press buttons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:42      | I walk into a room and it lights up automatically depending on time of day,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 38:47      | light levels, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:49      | And so for me, a lot of the time, just a standard hue button in there,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:54      | just in case I need different lighting is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:57      | And I did actually buy a light wave light switch,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 39:00      | and I have to say I really liked it,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 39:02      | apart from one fairly significant flaw for my kitchen light,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:06      | which was my kitchen light is not dimmable and the light wave light switches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 39:11      | need dimmable lights because otherwise they flicker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 39:15      | So if I hadn't literally just like a week before replaced my kitchen light,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:23      | then I would have stuck with the light wave and just upgraded the kitchen light                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:27      | because it would be quite useful to be able to dim that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:29      | But as it is, what I ended up doing in the kitchen was I actually went to Aqara,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:34      | who we've already talked about today, because Aqara have light switches as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:38      | And because, so my kitchen light is just a standard on off light,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 39:44      | and it doesn't have a neutral, unless your place is very new, it probably won't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 39:50      | I got the Aqara H1 no neutral light switch, which is a bounce switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:55      | So you press it and it turns it on or turns it off depending on what it currently is statewide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:02      | But that is what worked really well for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 40:06      | And I really like that as a light switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 40:11      | Now, my parents have been looking at getting some smart light switches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 40:15      | because they are finally coming onto the app,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40:18      | but we can do both press buttons and have smart controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 40:22      | And then when we get home, lights will turn on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:25      | and we won't have to come in through the front door in the dark.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:29      | And so they are looking at a combination of the Aqara stuff and the light wave stuff,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 40:33      | Aqara, because we've already got Aqara stuff set up for them,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40:37      | and light wave because they are also thinking,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:39      | well, maybe now's the time to get dimmable lights that we can't just turn on and off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 40:45      | So yeah, I mean, it really depends on what kind of light switches you want,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 40:50      | both Aqara and light wave, of course, are home kit compatible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 40:53      | So whichever you get, you'll be able to turn lights on and off with home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 40:58      | I think light wave is going to be where we end up going,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41:00      | because we're going to continue having hue in lamps,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 41:04      | but we have, you know, like many homes in the UK,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:08      | because like homes all over, we have just have like tons of spotlight bulbs,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:11      | and it's like, I'm not going to put a few bulbs in all of those,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 41:16      | because I like to be able to feed my family as well as light switches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 41:41      | So yeah, this is what I guess I will do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41:46      | For me, I am, they do office, I will have somebody come and install them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 41:50      | Yeah, they have that as an option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:52      | I would be happier with that, just because as well,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 41:54      | like I would, I want to do all of the light switches in the house with these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 41:59      | And so I figure I can have someone come in one day and change like, I don't know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:04      | like 20, 10, I don't know how many there are in my house to be honest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 42:08      | I feel like this is the thing that I know I will do the counting and be sad about how many I have to buy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 42:14      | But it's just something I figure I just want to get someone to come in and do it all,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 42:18      | because I want to be able to have control of the standard lights by voice,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 42:26      | but also with automations as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 42:29      | Like for example, we have like a little entryway,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 42:31      | and I want to be able to have a little motion detector in that little entryway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 42:38      | to just turn on the light whenever we're coming in and out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 42:41      | But I don't want to put a lamp or a hue bulb or something in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 42:44      | I want to just be able to have it be accessible to the standard light in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 42:49      | So yeah, all right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 42:51      | So light wave, this will be where I will go eventually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 42:55      | And I will say, I think for me, I think light waves, lights are good looking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 43:02      | Yeah, they sell them in the Apple Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 43:05      | So there you go then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 43:06      | That's what you need to know, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:08      | Yeah, it's one of those things where like the fact that it's sold in the Apple Store gives you that extra degree of confidence, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 43:13      | And you know, they have both white face plates and they've got like a stainless steel metal one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:18      | So depending on, you know, what your decorations like in various rooms, you can get them to match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:22      | And the other thing I'm going to mention is that they also do smart sockets like in wall smart sockets,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 43:28      | which I think is just a really nice idea for, you know, certain rooms where, you know, you like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:34      | for example, a guest room where maybe you want, you know, like a lamp, just a not that smart lamp to come on and off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:40      | and maybe a dehumidifier or a fan or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 43:43      | And then you can also just have them be regular switches for guests when there are people there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:48      | So I love that idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:50      | To be honest, I don't think I have a, ultimately, I don't believe I will have a socket in my house                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 43:58      | that will not have an extender on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 44:00      | Like a, because we don't really have a lot of power sockets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 44:03      | So like the idea of me having just one thing plugged in seems unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:08      | So I think I just noticed by going to Lightwave's website,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:11      | is they're bringing wire free switches to their product offering, which is pretty cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:15      | Yeah, so you'll be able to stick light switches in places where there are new wires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 44:20      | Yeah, I like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:21      | You're getting that anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 44:22      | I mean, once you get set up with this, first I was going to say, I would just get one or two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:28      | I wouldn't do 20 as your first go at this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:32      | Make sure that you're happy with technology, get a couple and then go crazy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 44:36      | But once you get that working, I can tell you as someone in the promised land here,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 44:42      | it is amazing having control over all the lights on your house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 44:46      | And like, if you want to switch, you already understand a car, you get in a car switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:51      | I just bought a set of three.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 44:52      | It was 40 bucks because my wife keeps now, now that she realises what we can do,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 44:57      | she's like, oh, I'd like to switch right here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:00      | So when I go to the bathroom at night, it turns on these two lights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:03      | I'm like, okay, you know, I mean, she could do it in home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:07      | But if I glue a switch to the back of her nightstand that makes her happy, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:13      | that's cool because these things are so cheap once you get that infrastructure built in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 45:18      | The only thing I'll say against doing one or two to start with is, for example,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:23      | if you look on the Aqara website, there's energy saving on the Aqara website,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:27      | on the lightweight website, they do have energy saving bundles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:30      | But I know that tradespeople can buy switches in bulk at a discount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 45:36      | And they do have registered installers on their website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 45:40      | And so it may be that if you contact an installer and you say like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 45:43      | I want to do my whole house, give me a quote that you could get a significant discount on these.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:50      | Because at 80 pounds for a single smart dimmer, it's not cheap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:56      | But if you can get that down by buying in bulk and getting all of them,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 46:01      | that would probably be worth doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 48:52      | as far as I know, there is exactly one lock or rather there's two versions of the same lock,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 49:08      | I hate the way this lock looks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 49:19      | So I don't love it as like a look, but I love the fact that I lift the handle and it locks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 49:28      | It works really well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 49:29      | It notifies me one advance when the batteries are running low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 49:33      | So yeah, I'm pretty pleased with it, but if you can change your doors,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 49:37      | then it'll be good to see what else you can get because home key support over here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 49:48      | I've only got a couple of products that actually support anywhere in the world at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 49:53      | Yeah, but there are options in other countries for other kinds of locks,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49:58      | but not that kind of lock and very few things in this country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 50:01      | I think some of the Aqara locks are going to get home key support                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:05      | or have home key support already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:08      | Even without home key support, automatic locks are amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 50:12      | They're so awesome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 50:14      | You can get home kit supported without home key supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:18      | Like I have home kit locks so I can push a button on my Stream Deck                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:23      | or talk to my Apple watch and my doors lock and unlock,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 50:27      | but it's not home key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 50:29      | But I don't think it's, I think that's a little overrated honestly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 50:32      | because what I do is I pull up in the driveway,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 50:35      | I lift up my wrist and say unlock the front door                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 50:38      | and by the time I get to the front door, it's unlocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 50:41      | Oh, I have a slight upgrade for you there, David, by the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 50:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 50:45      | If you put the lock in home kit and then you make a template lock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:48      | or template cover so you tell, you make it basically into a garage door                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 53:48      | A, you can double check it if you want to,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:50      | but you know that it's nothing's unlocked and you're good to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:54      | Yeah, and the advantage of doing that in [[Home Assistant]] would be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:57      | you could set a timer on it because if the back door is constantly getting unlocked,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 54:01      | you're going to get a lot of false positives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:04      | I mean, I just have it light up red when I'm going to bed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 54:13      | Yeah, a couple other ways you could solve this problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 54:15      | is you could probably just put it on a timed automation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 54:18      | at a certain time.

| 54:22      | It just locks the door whether, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:24      | Yeah, with a multi-point lock, you can't do that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:02:43   | I am interested because this is something that will make Adina very happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 01:02:49   | what I want in our house is multiple layers of lighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:02:52   | And I'm like, all right, we'll walk it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:55   | She's like, what I like in hotels is they have like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:58   | she says they have light on the ceiling,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:00   | but then there's light on the wall and then light on the deck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:03   | So we're working on that, but that's a good one, mood lighting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:06   | Okay, so right now the fish is nibbling on the hook rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:10   | Now we've got to reel them in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:11   | All right, let's give them some ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:13   | So my specific recommendation based on something that David said there, Mike,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:18   | is because David said, you know, like reflecting the colours that are on TV,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:03:23   | is Phillips have the hue gradient strips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:27   | And if you like these, they also do gradient strips for the computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:03:30   | So you can set this up in your studio as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:32   | And the idea is it's a light strip that you can stick on the back of your TV,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:35   | but they also do light bars that you can put on little stands by the side of your TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:03:40   | And the idea is they just point at the wall and they reflect the light that's on the TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:45   | And those lights are really good for ambient lighting as well as the TV integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:52   | Just it works exceptionally well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:03:55   | So I had the gradient strip for a while and then my TV died,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:03:58   | which was very inconsiderate and inconvenient of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:00   | So I upgraded to Phillips ambient light TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:04:03   | Now the ambient light TV itself does not integrate with HomeKit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:06   | but it does integrate with their ambient lighting stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:04:09   | And oh my gosh, it's really good. I love it. I love it so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:04:13   | So yeah, that's my very specific recommendation on that front.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:18   | Now, doesn't that require a box too?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:21   | Yeah. So if you go with the gradient strip and you're connecting it to a TV,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:04:26   | then you or the Play bars, you'll need the Play sync box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:04:32   | And other than that, if you've got like the right kind of Phillips TV,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:37   | then you can just connect stuff directly to it by the hub that you likely already have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:04:42   | But yeah, honestly, I didn't notice any visual lag or anything with the play sync box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:51   | So it's definitely worth looking into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:54   | So yeah, just one of those things where the Phillips stuff works really well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:04:59   | and especially because this is tying into a hub that you've already got, Mike,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:03   | I feel like that might be a good option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:05:05   | OK. Some others that I would recommend from Phillips is the light strips they have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:12   | They're called smart light two pack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:16   | It's like a little like 12 inch bar and you can land on the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:21   | I'm trying to get the exact product name madly as we talk here,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:24   | but it is a it's a bar that also plugs in through the hue system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:28   | and you can put them behind artwork, you know, like you've been in my place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:32   | I've got some of these little Star Wars statues and I put these bars behind them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:37   | And when you walk in the room at night and they're lit from behind, they look amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:05:42   | And these things are not that expensive compared to a lot of the hue products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:47   | And if you get some of those and place them around your house,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:50   | you can really do something fun with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:05:53   | Some other ones I would recommend are any of the home kit strips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:56   | Like if you have a kitchen now, if you just lined one of those strips under the kitchen cabinet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:01   | in fact, that's on my list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:03   | I just haven't done it yet for my house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:06:05   | You can put those colour strips under there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:07   | And then as you get more adapt with your home kit set up,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:10   | you can actually have the colour strip signal things like maybe if the door is unlocked,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:06:15   | maybe the strip turns red under the, you know, the kitchen cabinet or something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:21   | So you can do a lot of fun stuff with that when you get into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:25   | It's interesting though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:06:26   | Both Rose and I, I think, are in favor of hue for these Philips Hue products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:31   | I'm not sure if there's any others I would recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:06:34   | We're big fans of hue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:06:36   | Like, and I've already got all the hub and all that stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:39   | So like, we have a bunch of hue stuff now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:42   | So I like to just keep adding into that system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:06:44   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:06:45   | That light strip I was talking about is called the Philips Hue Play PLAY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:49   | And they have white ones, but they also have coloured ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:53   | So you can pick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:06:56   | And I've put a link to one of the bundles of the play stuff in the show notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:06:59   | But folks should note that obviously you need to pick like the gradient strip,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:03   | depending on the size of your TV and things like that,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:05   | if that's what you're looking for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:07   | But it gives you a link to find all of the different parts for the bundle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:11   | So hopefully that will be useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:13   | But yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:14   | Meross is another light strip that I would recommend if you need like long light strips                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:18   | because they do 20 meter ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:20   | But honestly, the reason, one of the reasons why I recommend Hue for lighting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:07:23   | is because the colour and the brightness options are something that,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:28   | you know, the colour will always match and you can get really bright smart bulbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:34   | And I'm not sure about your home mic, but some homes in the UK,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:07:40   | I'm not quite sure what they were thinking and how many, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:44   | forests they were planning on burning to have one light bulb in the middle of the room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:07:48   | Or if they were fine living in a spider infested, you know, haven for, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:53   | creepy crawlies or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:07:54   | But it feels like if you just put one light in the middle of the room,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:57   | then everything's going to be really dark everywhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:59   | So being able to get a decently bright bulb is well worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:03   | Though obviously you're going to be going with the smart light switches for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:07   | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:08   | Meross light strip is a follow up recommendation if you need longer ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:08:12   | That's the one that I have stuck underneath the bed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:08:14   | because it can go all the way around the bed with leftovers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:17   | So I can see when, you know, it's the middle of the night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:08:21   | The one thing Phillips isn't doing very well right now that I'd like to see them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:25   | is make a product to light like artwork on the wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:08:28   | You know, like gallery lighting kind of stuff that you could connect to home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:33   | And I've been kind of looking because we're putting more artwork up at our house                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:37   | and I haven't really found any acceptable products for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:40   | I feel like that's something that that he would be good at if they did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:08:44   | Yeah, you can definitely get lights from IKEA, which of course with the IKEA hub                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:08:52   | I have some, I actually stuck them on my bed, but they're designed to like put on a shelf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:57   | like above something and then like shine light down onto what is underneath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:09:02   | But you could also use it to light up artwork or similar in that sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:09:07   | So there's definitely options out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:10   | But I think it's one of those things that when it gets to stuff like that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:09:13   | people tend to buy the dumb one a smart plug rather than the smart light                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:18   | which costs 20 times the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:09:20   | Yeah, well, either way, Mike, I think some mood lighting would be fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:09:24   | And it's kind of a, you don't have to do it all at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:27   | You know, you can just start start small and then see where it goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:09:31   | I like to look for places in the house that have like, like where a strip light would fit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:09:36   | Like I'm getting ready to put up a shelf in my studio and I was thinking,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:09:40   | well, I'll put a strip light at the back of the shelf facing up the wall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:09:44   | so I can light the stuff I put on it from behind because that looks cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:09:48   | But why not put one at the front of the shelf too?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:50   | And then I could independently light them and do all kinds of fun effects with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:55   | You know, but just start being explore with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:09:59   | So that's my recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:10:01   | Rose, what do you think Mike should do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:03   | What's your request?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:05   | Well, my suggestion is going to be to look into heating and air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:11   | Because, I mean, over here in the UK, we tend not to have air conditioning in homes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:16   | because we're British, we will keep calm and carry on regardless,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:10:20   | even when perhaps we shouldn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:10:22   | But, you know, smart heating in particular,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:27   | being able to individually control like radiated thermostats in a room                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:10:32   | or control a whole home's heating system is definitely something worth looking at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:39   | And to tie this back into what we were talking about earlier with the smart light switches,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:43   | lightwave actually integrates with some of the smart heating systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:10:48   | So you may find that a slightly dumber already integrated heating system in your home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:10:54   | could integrate with lightwave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:10:56   | And if not, then there's options with like Aqara radiator controllers,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:00   | various different options and things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:03   | And then tying that into, you know, some air purifiers and smart fans for the summer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:07   | so that you can, you know, cool things down and circulate air as needed is definitely,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:11:12   | it's not something where you're just going to do this overnight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:11:14   | But it's really nice to be like, oh, I'm on my way home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11:18   | I'm going to turn up the bedroom thermostat now because it's cold out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:22   | Yeah, we have from the previous owners are upstairs radiators are controlled by a nest,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:11:28   | which is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:11:31   | But we, and we have under floor heat and downstairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:34   | No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:11:35   | But I think we might be able to change out some stuff to actually get it to be Wi-Fi controlled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:41   | or hopefully home controllable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:11:43   | But when this is just like one of those strange things of buying somebody else's home is that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:11:49   | I don't actually have all the answers to what system they put on the floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:53   | So we're still working that one out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:55   | And then we'll see what we can put in its place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:11:58   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:59   | I think it helps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:12:00   | I believe, and this is going purely from memory, that Meross came out with a thermostat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:06   | for under floor heating that's home kit compatible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:09   | Now, obviously it depends on the under floor heating system, et cetera, caveats apply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:15   | But it's certainly worth investigating as an option because I do, I know that there are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:21   | under floor heating thermostats for home kit available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:25   | Other than that, I also know a friend with an under floor heating system that it turns out is Honeywell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:30   | and that integrates with Lightwave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:33   | So hopefully, fingers crossed, you may actually be able to tie some of this stuff in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:12:40   | And yeah, I've heard of the nest stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:44   | Obviously, when people say nest, it brings up the image of the Google thermostat in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:54   | But yeah, fingers crossed, there'll be a way to upgrade to something that is a little bit more home kit friendly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:00   | in the not too distant future and hopefully at a not too exorbitant cost as well,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:05   | because that's the problem with buying a house, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:07   | It's not quite the same as a boat in that it's a whole to pour money into,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:11   | but it certainly feels like it eats a lot of money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:13   | Well, it can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:14   | I mean, we're planning to be here for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:16   | So a lot of this stuff, like the nest, the nest is working great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:19   | Like we don't really need to change it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:13:21   | Like eventually it's like, well, I would like to have it into home kit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:13:24   | just I have a product in home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:28   | And you know, really, we're using one of, it's one of the older nests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:32   | So like eventually that we would want to change that too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:13:35   | So who knows, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:36   | But it's one of those things we'll just have to check as time goes on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:39   | And that's the promise of matter, right? That in a year or two,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:13:43   | the stuff should be easier and cheaper because there'll be competition and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:47   | you don't have to like look for all the magic logos when you go to buy something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:51   | And I really hope that all comes true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:54   | Yeah, same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:55   | The good news is, is I went on the Merrill's website and I have just found                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:59   | the smart thermostat for electric underfloor heating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:14:03   | So there will be a link to that in the show notes for folks if anybody is interested                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:08   | because it feels like there's going to be more than one person                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:14:11   | who's got this request or problem that they may be wanting to solve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:16   | I've also found that they actually have a smart light switch,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:20   | which I may have to investigate as an option for my parents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:23   | because I didn't realise that Merrill should come out with a UK EU light switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:26   | So certainly an option worth considering there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:31   | Well, either way, what we didn't tell everybody is this is a two part episode                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:36   | that this is part one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:38   | And then in a year or two, Mike's coming back for part two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:41   | And I'm going to tell you how I'm how I'm ready for Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:14:44   | Yeah, at least the master of his domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:14:47   | One thing I will actually just say if folks are looking and they're going,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:51   | I'm not sure like maybe I should try Homebridge or [[Home Assistant]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:14:54   | I would suggest [[Home Assistant]] over Homebridge just because they are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:00   | like it's designed as a whole system by itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:15:04   | You can pull everything into [[Home Assistant]] and then just send the bits back                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 01:15:09   | So for example, I have smart plugs on my my washing machine, my tumble dryer,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 01:15:31   | And yeah, there's monthly releases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:34   | They're working on, they've already got matches support,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:15:36   | thread support, things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:38   | So yeah, I definitely go [[Home Assistant]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:15:40   | I've also never had like the default rooms where everything shuffles around                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:15:43   | in HomeKit and it's all suddenly in a default room happen with [[Home Assistant]],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:48   | but it happened fairly frequently with Homebridge for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:51   | So yeah, certainly worth considering as an option if you do look for upgrades,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:56   | but I don't think you need to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:58   | At least not yet, Mike.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:00   | I do think that people make the mistake of grouping those two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:16:03   | They're like, oh, Homebridge, [[Home Assistant]], I don't want any of that stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:06   | To me, there's like on difficulty level, you know, one of 10,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:12   | let's say HomeKit is like a two, [[Home Assistant]] is like a four or five,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:16   | and Homebridge is like a seven to nine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:19   | And Homebridge, in my experience, working with it was unstable,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:23   | which is no fun because you don't want to have to redo it or have it break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:27   | Whereas [[Home Assistant]], I've been using it not as much as Rose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:30   | I've only been using it now three months, but it's stable and it works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:35   | But you don't need to start there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:37   | I feel like if you just get this stuff set up, you're talking about your way ahead of the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:41   | And then like if you want to start putting complex rules in,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:16:45   | then you start talking about apps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:47   | We didn't even get into that today, but we'll get to that next time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:50   | But there are some great HomeKit apps that don't require you to install [[Home Assistant]],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:16:54   | but still give you a lot of the control you get from [[Home Assistant]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:57   | And then even if that's not enough, then I think you go to [[Home Assistant]],                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:01   | which is kind of awesome too, but not necessary for everybody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:05   | No, definitely not, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:17:06   | I have to say, so in the Zoom conversation that we are using for this recording,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:17:12   | I have just pasted like the picture of what the trace is,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:17:16   | so I can see exactly what happened when one of my automations fired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:19   | And I can see exactly when it fired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:17:22   | And the fact that I can look at this and be like,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:24   | hey, what went wrong somewhere or what happened somewhere?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:28   | Why did it do this thing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:17:29   | That's what I love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:31   | But you can work around that with something like Home Log for HomeKit,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:34   | at least to start with until you come back and I can go,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:37   | okay, I'm ready for the next level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

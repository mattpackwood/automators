| 00:00      | Hello and welcome to Automators, the automation podcast about making everything be productive           |
| 00:07      | on your behalf so you can just sit back and relax the entire time.                                      |
| 00:11      | I am Rosemary Orchard and joined, as always, by my pal, David Sparks.                                   |
| 00:15      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                |
| 00:16      | I am great, Rose.                                                                                       |
| 00:17      | Good talking to you.                                                                                    |
| 00:18      | We have a guest today, too.                                                                             |
| 00:20      | We do.                                                                                                  |
| 00:21      | Welcome back to the show, Scotty Jackson.                                                               |
| 00:23      | Hi, folks.                                                                                              |
| 00:24      | Thanks for having me back.                                                                              |
| 00:26      | It is lovely to be here.                                                                                |
| 00:27      | The room is just exactly as I left it.                                                                  |
| 00:29      | I feel like I didn't miss a beat.                                                                       |
| 00:31      | Well, we replaced the couch, but we got an exact copy, so you can't tell.                               |
| 00:37      | But you know.                                                                                           |
| 00:38      | Mm-hmm.                                                                                                 |
| 00:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 00:40      | After that incident with the extra dogs in here, Ashoka had a little accident, but you                    |
| 00:44      | know, it's all good.                                                                                    |
| 00:45      | Wait a second.                                                                                          |
| 00:46      | Do not besmirch my dog.                                                                                 |
| 00:47      | You can't do that.                                                                                      |
| 00:48      | Ashoka doesn't have that.                                                                               |
| 00:50      | I think she just got very excited when chasing an invisible squirrel.                                   |
| 00:53      | We did yesterday find a box of tissue, which is her Kryptonite tissues, or she does like                |
| 00:59      | to destroy this.                                                                                        |
| 01:00      | But either way, we do like to talk about automation here, too.                                          |
| 01:04      | And Scotty, it's great having you back on the show.                                                     |
| 01:07      | We had you earlier, but you know, you've been really busy lately with some of your                      |
| 01:11      | audio stuff, with some of your focus stuff, and we just got a whole list here to talk                   |
| 01:16      | to you about.                                                                                           |
| 01:17      | So, man, thanks for coming on.                                                                          |
| 01:19      | Before we get into it, I just want to thank everybody who got in on that early discount.                |
| 01:23      | On the Shortcuts for Mac field guide, I really appreciate it.                                           |
| 01:26      | Sales went great.                                                                                       |
| 01:27      | I really appreciate the support, and I'm hearing from a bunch of folks that are automating              |
| 01:31      | shortcuts now on the Mac, and I appreciate that you guys got it, and that I'm able to                   |
| 01:35      | help you out a little bit.                                                                              |
| 01:37      | And I guess I would add to that, Rose, have you noticed in the Ventura Beta how much better             |
| 01:42      | shortcuts this, it feels to me a lot more stable with the new Ventura, so that's good.                  |
| 01:48      | It definitely does.                                                                                     |
| 01:49      | And I hear from Scotty that he's been having some fun with the Betas as well, and hopefully             |
| 01:54      | of the good kind.                                                                                       |
| 01:55      | Recently, Scotty, I've not spoken to you in a few days about that.                                      |
| 01:57      | Well, I mean, you always put fun and air quotes when you talk about Betas, but as Dev1 Betas            |
| 02:03      | go, see, I don't want to jinx it.                                                                       |
| 02:06      | See, if I say that as Dev1 Betas go, it's pretty solid, I'm going to need to run Kill                   |
| 02:12      | All Notification Centre again on my mind.                                                               |
| 02:15      | It's like a three times daily event.                                                                    |
| 02:18      | Well, don't worry about it, man, by the time this releases, it'll be on Dev development                 |
| 02:22      | two or three.                                                                                           |
| 02:24      | It's going to be a while.                                                                               |
| 02:25      | Almost certainly, yeah.                                                                                 |
| 02:26      | Oh, perfect.                                                                                            |
| 02:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 02:28      | So now, as everyone listens to this, they can enjoy probably a public beta too.                         |
| 02:32      | We're all having a great time on all the new Betas.                                                     |
| 02:36      | I am loving the emphasis on focus and focus being like sort of a first class citizen now                |
| 02:43      | and focused saying, okay, when I'm in this focus, not only do I have like these apps                    |
| 02:48      | and these notifications, but I have this watch face and I have these home screens and it                |
| 02:54      | feels like a really sort of total way of working now.                                                   |
| 02:59      | And I've not set all of this up the way it will be even for the foreseeable future, but                 |
| 03:05      | I see so much potential in my ability to make a lot of use out of that.                                 |
| 03:10      | Let's actually go down that rabbit hole for just a minute because focus is a topic that                 |
| 03:15      | comes up pretty frequently here because it is very automation adjacent, I guess I would                 |
| 03:20      | say.                                                                                                    |
| 03:21      | They have this focus mode and there are new benefits in the beta as we talked about them                |
| 03:27      | in our last episode, but even on the currently shipping version, there is a bunch of automation         |
| 03:33      | stuff there.                                                                                            |
| 03:34      | What are you doing with focus and are you incorporating automation into it?                             |
| 03:39      | Well, yes, focus being a trigger for shortcuts is huge for me and it took me a while to wrap            |
| 03:46      | my head around A, the fact that that exists and B, okay, so what do I do with that?                     |
| 03:52      | And so I found myself being able to set up particular focus sessions for myself and have                |
| 03:58      | that do things because when the focus goes on, it triggers a shortcut.                                  |
| 04:03      | When the focus goes off, it triggers another shortcut, which is great.                                  |
| 04:06      | So that means that for me, not only can I put myself in a situation where I'm in basically              |
| 04:13      | do not disturb except for my super favourite people during a certain period of time, but                 |
| 04:19      | I can also tie that into controlling home accessories with shortcuts.                                   |
| 04:24      | So I've got a Phillips hue go light on my desk, which is like sort of like a half a                     |
| 04:31      | sphere that sits up and lights up like a hue light.                                                     |
| 04:35      | So I can have it illuminate in particular colours as a visible sign to me of, okay, Scotty,              |
| 04:45      | now is the time in which you're meant to be planning.                                                   |
| 04:47      | So see the light, that means plan or see this light at the end of the day, that means reflect.          |
| 04:54      | And through the magic of the [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]] app, which Rose, you turn me on to, there are shortcuts            |
| 05:01      | actions that allow you to do like some different stuff with your light.                                 |
| 05:06      | So I have it as part of the shortcut flash the light five times and then turn red so                    |
| 05:13      | that I know, okay, here's the warning, here it comes, and now it's red.                                 |
| 05:17      | So I get like this sort of psychological sense of just like in a car driving up to the intersection,    |
| 05:24      | you know, it goes doesn't go from green to red.                                                         |
| 05:27      | Just an amber moment so that we know, okay, either slow down and stop or get myself safely              |
| 05:34      | through this intersection.                                                                              |
| 05:35      | And that's what I have my light doing for me.                                                           |
| 05:37      | And I found that to be enormously helpful because you know, Rose, you and I have discussed              |
| 05:42      | you know, the effectiveness or not of notifications because they like, yeah, I get notified of          |
| 05:47      | something and then I swipe to dismiss now it's gone.                                                    |
| 05:49      | Whoops.                                                                                                 |
| 05:50      | So now I'm not actually going to be really notified or remembering that.                                |
| 05:55      | And at the same time, it's also like annoying to set up invasive alarms for everything.                 |
| 05:59      | So I found that like a light as an ambient signal of, hey, Scotty, here's stuff you're                  |
| 06:04      | meant to do right now has been really, really effective.                                                |
| 06:08      | So Scotty, not everybody's familiar with [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]] out there.                                         |
| 06:11      | Tell us about it more.                                                                                  |
| 06:12      | I'm not going to proclaim to be an expert in the [[Signals for HomeKit\|Signals]] app, but essentially it allows                 |
| 06:16      | you to create shortcuts actions that tell your light to do stuff.                                       |
| 06:22      | And I think it basically means flashing mostly or and you can you can set here's what colour,            |
| 06:31      | here's the interval at which to flash and here's how long to flash for and so on.                       |
| 06:36      | I also have a shortcut that I use for my son when he's away in his room playing video games             |
| 06:44      | and it's time for him to come down.                                                                     |
| 06:46      | I have like lights flashing red and blue like like police, it's great.                                  |
| 06:52      | And you can, of course, couple that with other shortcuts actions like play music.                       |
| 06:56      | So we can have some sort of classic by Rick Astley accompanying that flashing lights situation          |
| 07:02      | perhaps, which means, you know, you have crossed the threshold and need to come down for dinner.        |
| 07:07      | We've told you for the last time, this is your this is your final warning, sir.                         |
| 07:11      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 07:12      | So the red and the blue lights are in his room.                                                         |
| 07:14      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 07:15      | So he's got Phillips Hue lights that we've put into a lamp and and a swag lamp like one                 |
| 07:25      | on his desk and one hanging.                                                                            |
| 07:27      | And he's also got strip lights that are plugged into a smart plug.                                      |
| 07:31      | So I have the smart plug go off and on in tandem with the with the lights flashing.                     |
| 07:36      | It really is quite a magnificent and unsettling effect.                                                 |
| 07:42      | I'm guessing it grabs his attention, though, so, you know, I mean, the only thing that                  |
| 07:47      | I would add to that is maybe a smart plug on on the video game console so that, you                     |
| 07:51      | know, if he really is over the threshold, you just kill the power, but that that's                      |
| 07:55      | possibly going a bit far.                                                                               |
| 07:57      | That's a good way to get yourself pushed off a cliff in a wheelchair one day.                           |
| 08:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 08:01      | Well, I mean, you know, that that that will be for the the after the Rick Astley version.               |
| 08:07      | So he knows, you know, like, this is your final warning.                                                |
| 08:09      | I'm here.                                                                                               |
| 08:10      | I'm here.                                                                                               |
| 08:11      | I'm here to get this or whatever it is, you know, but yeah, I like [[Signals for HomeKit]]              |
| 08:16      | [[Mikah Sargent]] is actually the one that turned me onto this because I think the idea is like              |
| 08:19      | parents telling their kids it's time for dinner or something, but you can use it with any               |
| 08:24      | of your personal shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 08:26      | It doesn't have home kit.                                                                               |
| 08:28      | It's not in the home automation side of things.                                                         |
| 08:31      | When you convert to shortcut in home automations and scenes, that's unfortunately not something         |
| 08:36      | that can show up there because it's a personal app on your device, but it will, you know,               |
| 08:41      | lights and it restores the original colour and brightness afterwards as well, which is something         |
| 08:46      | that is very difficult slash impossible to do natively with [[HomeKit]]. You would have to take             |
| 08:53      | an educated guess as to what the light was supposed to be like before and flashing lights and or        |
| 08:59      | pulsing them or you can also just have it turn like a certain colour for 15 seconds and then turn        |
| 09:04      | back or whatever it is if you if you don't want you know the extra motion effects. But it is a          |
| 09:12      | really useful app to just sort of have in your in your pocket ready to go and it works on               |
| 09:17      | Mac as well as iPhone and iPad, which is a really nice bonus for those of us who want our shortcuts     |
| 09:21      | to be everywhere. And it's just so awesome to see this rich ecosystem around [[HomeKit]] and [[HomeKit]]        |
| 09:28      | adjacent apps. There's so much to do there like if you're just if you're interested in home             |
| 09:33      | automation and you're just using the home app even though it gets better with the next release,         |
| 09:39      | you're missing out. I mean, and we've talked about on the show we've done episodes before with all      |
| 09:43      | these apps, but it is a truly remarkable number one that [[Apple]] left the door open for third party       |
| 09:50      | developers to get in and you know, fiddle around with [[HomeKit]] and number two, the way the developers    |
| 09:57      | have delivered the goods on this stuff. But we skipped over Scotty. So we started this conversation     |
| 10:04      | around focus. What are the kinds of focus modes that you're using? So like I say, I think there's       |
| 10:11      | a lot of work that I still have to do here, but I do a focus in the morning on weekdays for planning.   |
| 10:17      | So when I am in planning, my light turns purple to let me know. And I'm basically in do not             |
| 10:24      | disturb. I don't think anybody can get a hold of me for this 10 minute window of time. And that         |
| 10:31      | allows me the time and space to sit down and write out my calendar and my plan for the day.             |
| 10:37      | Which I mean, and I'll be honest, like this is this is also the thing that I will like come down        |
| 10:43      | the stairs late to my basement office and see the purple light and go oh my god, yeah, yeah, I know     |
| 10:48      | and skip over it. But the days when I do that, boy, do I ever feel the pain. So the purple light        |
| 10:54      | helps remind me no seriously, Scotty, this is important. Can I just end it up for a second?             |
| 10:59      | I love that. Please, please. I think that's such a great idea because this stuff is really hard.        |
| 11:05      | But you know, as people as people who have done the planning type things,                               |
| 11:10      | my experience is every time I do it, I get the time back. You know, it's not like it's lost time.       |
| 11:15      | You think it's lost time when you're like, oh, I got to spend 20 minutes playing my day.                |
| 11:20      | But then at the end of the day, you get way more done. It almost feels like you doubled                 |
| 11:25      | your time in the day because you planned it. And so it's a net positive, but it's so hard to do.        |
| 11:30      | So any kind of little hack, whether it's a purple light or a song going off or                          |
| 11:35      | changing your home screen, I mean, I feel like that element of focus mode                               |
| 11:39      | is there for a reason. And it's a really good way to kind of hack the computer between your ears        |
| 11:45      | to actually do the work. And I love that that you put that light on. And maybe,                         |
| 11:51      | you know, you groan at it, but how often does it actually trigger you to do the work?                   |
| 11:56      | Oh, I mean, if it doesn't trigger me to do the work, it triggers me to groan and know that I'm          |
| 12:01      | not doing the work and feel bad about it. So either way, the outcome is good. The light has             |
| 12:05      | served its purpose. It has served its purpose to remind me that this is how my attention is meant       |
| 12:10      | to be used right now. And so either I'm honouring it or I'm not, but either way, I am aware of what      |
| 12:16      | I am supposed to be doing. And I think that's great. And I love what you said, David, about             |
| 12:21      | the computer between your ears, because, you know, we can talk about automations in [[HomeKit]]             |
| 12:25      | till we're blue in the face because I love this stuff. But to me, the most potent automations           |
| 12:31      | are the ones that I make for myself, by myself, to say like my process is to do this. I write out       |
| 12:40      | my plan in this particular way at the beginning of the day, and that works. And so that automation      |
| 12:45      | is really around decision automation, I guess, to say, here's how I approach things. So not just        |
| 12:51      | have I used like technical automations to turn the light purple. I have used my human brain             |
| 12:57      | automations to say, here is what I do when my light is purple. Here is how I think, here is what I      |
| 13:05      | write. So now I don't have to worry about deciding, how do I use this time? How do I go about planning? |
| 13:11      | I have decided how planning is and what I do. So I think that is probably the most powerful             |
| 13:17      | automation I've got. Yeah, it isn't, you know, we've never really talked about it. This is kind         |
| 13:22      | of a crossover to the Focus podcast. But automation definitely works on the human, like the idea of     |
| 13:30      | picking your clothes the night before. So in the morning, you don't have to have that decision          |
| 13:33      | fatigue of deciding what you're going to wear. And there is a place in computer based automation to     |
| 13:41      | help kind of train yourself to do that. And I know that sounds kind of manipulative, the word           |
| 13:46      | train yourself, but I don't really know a better way to state it. And, you know, you get automation     |
| 13:51      | triggers like turning lights on or sending you a reminder. And maybe that's all you need to like        |
| 13:57      | make a little progress and just a little progress every day can make a lot of difference.               |
| 14:01      | That is very true. Yeah, I really like, you know, the inclusion of lights                               |
| 14:08      | into that, though, because, you know, you've got your focus modes, which can turn on and off            |
| 14:12      | automatically. And so then I guess you're using shortcuts, automations to then tie the home kit         |
| 14:18      | things into that. So if, you know, if you manually turn on your planning focus mode,                    |
| 14:23      | does that also make the light go purple? Yes, it does. So yeah, the focus,                              |
| 14:28      | the focus becomes the trigger, and then the focus is scheduled. So I that combination is                |
| 14:35      | really powerful. And now I'll be able to simplify my shortcut as well, because the other thing that     |
| 14:39      | the shortcut does is it changes the wallpaper on my phone to purple, and it changes my watch            |
| 14:48      | to a watch face that is all purple with just hands. And so if I if I look at my watch, if I             |
| 14:56      | look at my phone, I am getting visually reminded all over the place. No, no, it's purple time.          |
| 15:02      | So that's purple time is planning time. I figured I figured you would I kind of chuckle                 |
| 15:09      | to myself when I when I settled on like purple being a planning colour, I thought Rose would             |
| 15:13      | probably approve of this. But knowing that there's some additional focus things coming with iOS 16      |
| 15:20      | and iPad OS 16 and watch OS nine, I could maybe simplify that a little bit. But having that shortcut    |
| 15:28      | trigger those different states and appearances of my devices. Also, you know, settings in the           |
| 15:34      | focus of, okay, no badges, badges are all turned off. So even if I've got, you know, 18 unread emails   |
| 15:42      | and a couple of unread Twitter DMs, those are not going to appear visibly to me. And I've               |
| 15:48      | limited my home screen to a screen that has no icons on it. So all I have is the dock all I have        |
| 15:53      | is the dock and big purple. And that is what again, what reminds me, don't start, you know,             |
| 16:00      | getting distracted now, you know, open up calendar, sure, as needed, like a, like a good boy, and       |
| 16:06      | checking your OmniFocus and look at an agenda. Those are the three places that I spend my time.         |
| 16:10      | Those are the three apps that I spend my time in. I would love to see if I could                        |
| 16:13      | have focus do like a screen time thing where I, where any, any other app is locked with a               |
| 16:21      | little hourglass thing. I don't know if I can do that or not. I use screen time with my children.       |
| 16:26      | I hadn't thought of using the screen time on myself until just this very moment. So now I've            |
| 16:30      | assigned myself homework while thinking aloud. I'm not sure you can do that, but that'll                |
| 16:36      | certainly be interesting to hear back later on. One thing. So you said it's all timer based. So         |
| 16:42      | are you just using a personal automation that say at a certain time trigger focus mode? Is that the     |
| 16:47      | way you're, you're doing it? No, in focus, you can actually schedule them. So there's actually          |
| 16:52      | scheduled focus. So you can go into schedule focus. And so my focus, planning focus, for example,       |
| 16:58      | is scheduled to run from 9am to 914am every day. And so when that, when that, or every weekday,         |
| 17:08      | excuse me. And so when that focus activates, that triggers the shortcut. And it also, you know,         |
| 17:14      | dictates all of the things that are set within that focus, like here are the home screens and           |
| 17:19      | here are the people who are allowed to contact me. And I think there are different app allowances       |
| 17:25      | as well for notifications. But I've been trying to turn almost every app notification off.              |
| 17:32      | Yeah. And I've also been toying with the notion of maybe, maybe my watch is the only place where        |
| 17:39      | notifications happen. But in any case, focus certainly further constrains what I am allowing            |
| 17:47      | into my universe in that period of time. Because I feel like, you know what, even if something          |
| 17:52      | thermonuclear happened at work, at the very moment that I triggered do not disturb,                     |
| 17:57      | a 14 minute response time is still not too shabby. So it'll be okay. Whatever it is,                    |
| 18:03      | it'll be okay for 14 minutes. Yeah. And I think by default, focus modes will do the                     |
| 18:09      | repeated calls are allowed through type thing. So something was literally on fire and exploding         |
| 18:14      | and somebody called you two or three times. I think it would be three times and they get                |
| 18:18      | through on the third try. But they'd have to call you three times within like a couple of minutes       |
| 18:23      | inside of that 14 minute window, which seems pretty unlikely unless, I don't know,                      |
| 18:28      | I don't think you work in a fire department. I've not heard that change happen in your life. So         |
| 18:32      | I'm guessing it's possibly something slightly less critical than that that could wait less              |
| 18:38      | than 15 minutes for you to be available again, which is quite nice.                                     |
| 18:42      | Do people call each other? I hope that no one ever calls me ever. Pretty much never.                    |
| 18:48      | If the phone rings, it's probably either telemarketing or my mom.                                       |
| 18:51      | Like, so a phone ringing in general is kind of off putting now in this year 2022.                       |
| 19:00      | I mean, at work, we use huddles on [[Slack]] with each other. And so you can just click on somebody         |
| 19:06      | and then hop into a huddle. But it doesn't do a ring sound. When you phone somebody and it goes         |
| 19:11      | ring, ring, that sort of thing, it just goes and notifies somebody that somebody wants to huddle        |
| 19:16      | with you. And they pop up in the bottom left. But it's also really easy to ignore if you're             |
| 19:22      | focused on something or if you're busy dealing with other things. It's also very easy to miss if        |
| 19:27      | you're totally absorbed into something else. But I've apologised for the few times that's happened      |
| 19:31      | and everyone was fine with it. They know that if it was urgent, then team still has the function        |
| 19:36      | where if you call somebody, it rings like a telephone. It scares everybody back to the Dark Ages.       |
| 19:41      | I was wondering if the [[Slack]] one is by design so that you can kind of ignore it. And that way,          |
| 19:46      | if you really need someone, you can be like, hey, can you join the huddle? Please, we need you.         |
| 19:52      | Yeah, because [[Slack]] has calls and huddles. And they're two separate concepts that                       |
| 19:58      | they're very similar, but a call can have video. A huddle can't have video. It can have                 |
| 20:02      | screen sharing, but no video. And a call, however, will ring like a regular sort of phone type thing    |
| 20:11      | like [[FaceTime]] or whatever. They're adding it. By the time you listen to this, there may be video        |
| 20:15      | in huddles and [[Slack]]. I saw some announcements. I mean, I'm fine with them adding video, but            |
| 20:20      | honestly, it just works as a really easy way to talk to people at work and be able to share             |
| 20:26      | information quickly so that we can solve whatever the problem is, which often involves a little         |
| 20:30      | bit of automation. But yeah, back to your automations with the focus modes. So this is something I've   |
| 20:39      | found to be a little bit of a minor flaw with focus modes, because if you go into settings              |
| 20:45      | and focus modes and you use the scheduling there, which you said you do, then you don't get the         |
| 20:49      | option of saying, but not on a bank holiday or a holiday for Americans, you know, days where            |
| 20:54      | you're not supposed to be working or when I've actually got holiday booked or vacation.                 |
| 20:58      | Do you have anything in place to handle that? Or do you just manually disable the focus modes           |
| 21:04      | when they pop up on those days? So the good news is, as I've thought about this because                 |
| 21:13      | obviously, I don't want to be invasive to myself in such cases. And so the good news is that the        |
| 21:21      | light is at my desk. So if I'm not at my desk, I don't see the light, that's cool. It's also a          |
| 21:29      | do not disturb period that lasts 14 minutes at 9am. At 9am on a holiday, I truly hope I'm doing         |
| 21:36      | something where I never even notice the fact that this has happened. And if I do notice,                |
| 21:42      | I also hope that it's not a big deal. I think that that's important. The one slightly invasive          |
| 21:50      | thing that I do is I have a 10am alarm every day called, did you take your meds question?               |
| 21:56      | Which labeling alarms, by the way, is required with every alarm. Every alarm should be labeled          |
| 22:02      | why it's an alarm. And the reason I set it for 10am is because on a weekend,                            |
| 22:09      | like even if I'm sleeping in, it's 10am, get up. It's okay. And on a holiday. So 10am is kind of        |
| 22:19      | like my desired time to take my meds. This is, of course, like 7am. But in order to be gentle to        |
| 22:25      | myself, the 10am is kind of like the safety net, but also a time that isn't going to be too early       |
| 22:31      | on a not working day. So I've thought about how I've scheduled my things and what those things do       |
| 22:37      | so that if they are inappropriate, they're inappropriate in a way that is not problematic.              |
| 22:43      | Right. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Because I have just a standard work focus mode that              |
| 22:48      | goes nine to five, Monday to Friday, just like Dolly Parton says. And so what I have is I have          |
| 22:54      | a part of the automation that's triggered when my work focus mode starts is it runs a shortcut,         |
| 23:02      | and that shortcut will return one or zero, depending on whether or not it is a day that I               |
| 23:08      | am not working. One is a day that I'm not working and zero is a day that I am working.                  |
| 23:13      | And this is just done by checking the calendar. So it looks for all day events on                       |
| 23:21      | the bank holiday calendar over here that don't include Scotland or Ireland in brackets after            |
| 23:26      | the name, because there are Scottish specific bank holidays in Ireland, specific bank holidays.         |
| 23:30      | I think Welsh specific bank holidays as well, but no English specific ones. Great.                      |
| 23:35      | And it also looks, I have a specific holiday calendar that I put all of my travel and not               |
| 23:42      | working days into. So I then check, and if there's any results in that, then I just return a one.       |
| 23:51      | And that means that, hey, you should turn off the work focus mode now and exit the shortcut.            |
| 23:55      | And then that's what that's what that does. And then otherwise it just continues with the rest          |
| 24:01      | of my shortcut, which goes through the previously setting home screens and watch faces, which is        |
| 24:06      | now part of the automation and the focus mode settings itself in iOS 16, which I love. But              |
| 24:13      | then everything else, you know, just happens, which is what I need for work. Yes, I love it.            |
| 24:19      | I was just looking, you know, I was thinking another way to do this would be to set a calendar          |
| 24:27      | alarm that triggers an [[AppleScript]] with I think you can still do. I haven't done it for a couple       |
| 24:33      | years now, but you can have it open a file when you trigger an alarm in the [[Apple Calendar]] app.         |
| 24:39      | I need to investigate this. Rose, have you ever played with this? But basically, you've got...          |
| 24:43      | Yeah, I have. And it's one of those things that a lot of the time, depending on what kind of calendar   |
| 24:49      | it is, so your calendar has to be a local calendar on your Mac. This is something that is really,       |
| 24:55      | really important for that to work. It can't be like an iCloud Calendar or something even or             |
| 25:02      | Google Calendar that doesn't work. And then once you've added the event and you go back in and you      |
| 25:07      | try to edit it, then there is probably but not guaranteed to be the option to add the [[AppleScript]].       |
| 25:14      | So I don't do that. I just have anything that's scheduled for things like that I have in        |
| 25:20      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] with a trigger for the right time. And that just deals with it for me.                 |
| 25:26      | Well, the advantage of putting it on a calendar event and the way it does is you open a file,           |
| 25:30      | they got rid of the run [[AppleScript]] command that they used to have years ago, which I wish they had.     |
| 25:34      | But I believe you can save a script file or an actual, an app out of automator. But how long            |
| 25:41      | is automator going to be around? Well, you can save a shortcut to your doc and then it gets             |
| 25:45      | put in your users applications folder. And then that shortcut is just like a mini application           |
| 25:49      | that can be opened. Yeah, you could run that. And then that would trigger the focus. But the            |
| 25:53      | advantage of getting back to the point that the advantage of putting it on a calendar event is          |
| 25:57      | if you move the calendar event or cancel it, let's say, you know, Scotty has a get focused              |
| 26:02      | calendar event, and he ties a script to it that triggers the focus mode. And then so today is           |
| 26:09      | like, well, I can't do it at nine o'clock today, I'm going to do it 10 o'clock. And he just adjusts     |
| 26:12      | his calendar when he's setting his blocks. Then at 10 o'clock, the purple light comes on. Or he         |
| 26:18      | says, today, I'm going to spend the day, you know, you know, I don't know, watering the garden,         |
| 26:23      | I'm not going to do the focus stuff today. And you just delete it for that day. And then                |
| 26:28      | the light doesn't turn purple that day. So I feel like there's something to this. I need to dig         |
| 26:32      | into it. But [[Apple]] has definitely made triggering events, triggering scripts with calendar events       |
| 26:38      | harder over the last few years. I don't think many people were using it.                                |
| 26:43      | No, no. So just for anybody who's listening, who wants to know, you have to add the event to            |
| 26:49      | your calendar, then you add an alert, go all the way to the bottom of the list, custom. And then        |
| 26:55      | you can change it. And so it gives you an option for it defaults to message with sound. And then        |
| 27:02      | you can change that from message with sound to email and email yourself or somebody else. And           |
| 27:06      | then there's open file. And my favourite part of this is the UI where you have much older Mac OS UI      |
| 27:12      | in the middle of some brand new Mac OS UI. And yeah, what so once you've changed it to open file,       |
| 27:19      | by the way, it defaults to opening your calendar at that time. So you'll need to then click on the      |
| 27:23      | calendar and click other. And then that's where you would choose. For example, if you add a shortcut    |
| 27:27      | to your dock on Mac OS, then you can go into your user folder. And then there's an applications         |
| 27:33      | folder inside of that. It has to be the applications folder in your user folder. And any shortcuts      |
| 27:37      | you've added to your dock will appear in that folder. Then you could have that file open, which         |
| 27:43      | should, but it's not guaranteed to depending on permissions, run it. And then you can change the        |
| 27:47      | time to be time of event minutes, hours, days before or after or on a specific date. But this           |
| 27:54      | does require your Mac to be always on. And so I've just delegated this to keyboard my show because      |
| 28:00      | it ends up working working out a bit easier for me to manage things there. And then the way I would     |
| 28:05      | do this, if I was doing it with a calendar event is I would just duplicate the event once I created     |
| 28:09      | it. So like if you're going to do the morning planning, just duplicate it a bunch of times.             |
| 28:13      | And as you're doing your weekly planning, you can copy a version from last week. So you don't           |
| 28:17      | have to go through all that every time. I'm going to test it out. I'll report back on that. But         |
| 28:21      | I want to see how that works. Now go switching to keyboard my show as a basis for this. How does        |
| 28:26      | keyboard my show allow you to do it when it adjusts to your changing calendar? I guess that             |
| 28:31      | because that's the problem. Well, I don't, I don't do calendar based ones. I do time based ones.        |
| 28:36      | And so it'll be a time like it'll have a trigger for the specific time. And now I'm trying to           |
| 28:43      | remember, yeah, because it's got a time of day trigger, and you can filter it to specific days.         |
| 28:49      | And if it's something that I only want to run once, and then I don't want to run it again,              |
| 28:54      | then I will have a macro action at the end that will disable that macro. And so then it                 |
| 29:00      | won't get automatically triggered the next time that rolls around. So if I have it set for, I           |
| 29:05      | don't know, Friday at 6pm. And then I don't want it to run the next Friday at 6pm, then the last        |
| 29:11      | action in the macro will disable it. So if I forget to do it manually, you know, I don't actually       |
| 29:15      | need to even think about doing it manually. And next time I go to use it, I'll just change the          |
| 29:20      | time of the day that it's supposed to run on. The only disadvantage with this setup is it only          |
| 29:24      | allows me to trigger it. Like I can only set it up just under a week in advance. So, you know,          |
| 29:30      | I can't set it for in 10 days time or similar. But I'm sure there will be a way around that if I        |
| 29:36      | wanted to. But I just haven't looked into that yet, because scheduling things about a week in           |
| 29:42      | advance is about as far as my breaking handle at the moment. There's another tactic that I'll do        |
| 29:46      | here that isn't super dissimilar. But because you can run a shortcut from a URL, I have either a        |
| 29:54      | TextExpander or Mac text replacement snippet that is like focused, but with three Ss, so that when     |
| 29:59      | I type that, it replaces it with the URL to a shortcut that basically turns on a focus mode for         |
| 30:05      | me. And then I can drop that URL in any place where it might be kind of handy to have it.               |
| 30:11      | So, whether that's in a calendar event for myself or whether it's in a note or what have you,           |
| 30:18      | I can just quickly leave that for myself so that when I open that and I need to get down to work,       |
| 30:22      | all I have to do is click that link and the things will happen.                                         |
| 30:25      | That makes a lot of sense. I like that. I have something similar in Bunch, which just I use             |
| 30:31      | the command line options to run shortcuts at various times to start and stop focus mode.                |
| 30:38      | So the bunch that I use to start recording automators, same as the one that I use for                   |
| 30:42      | starting nested folders, started my podcasting focus mode. And so that worked really nicely             |
| 30:49      | for me and it's certainly a good solution for a lot of people, I think.                                 |

| 32:44      | putting words in your mouth, you also do a lot of recording and audio work and you've                   |
| 32:50      | brought automation to bear. In fact, that's one of the main reasons we want to have you in today,       |
| 32:53      | is talking about automation and audio. Let's work through the process. Can you give us an overview      |
| 33:00      | of what you're doing and then how automation fits in, then we can start digging into the details?       |
| 33:05      | Absolutely. The beginning is the best place to start. As you both know, I don't know if your            |
| 33:13      | listeners are aware, I do another podcast called Nested Folders with Rose. We talk about the            |
| 33:21      | philosophies around personal productivity and information management and self-care and how to           |
| 33:28      | use some of those principles to do our best work. I love doing that. I think that in a                  |
| 33:36      | world where things can change really fast and so can schedules, it's gotten to a point where I've       |
| 33:43      | needed to figure out some automation in order to make the post-production process a lot easier on       |
| 33:49      | myself because I handle all of our posts. I do the cuts, the cleanups, the publication and all          |
| 33:57      | of that sort of stuff. Particularly in the audio editing part, I needed to figure out                   |
| 34:05      | a way to make that easier for myself so that we could go from recording to ready to publish             |
| 34:12      | faster because we've ended up in a couple of spaces where because of our conflicting schedules or       |
| 34:19      | weird life health changes, we not necessarily had the amount of lead time that I would love.            |
| 34:27      | There have been a couple of cases where because of that, some episodes went out a little bit later      |
| 34:34      | than normal. I thought, okay, well, we're going to need to figure out some automation here in order     |
| 34:39      | to make this less work. That's been, I guess, the impetus for this conversation is how I started        |
| 34:49      | going through that process and what that ended up looking like.                                         |
| 34:52      | All right. Let's start breaking it down. We'll let you all start with prep.                             |
| 34:55      | Sure. I think a lot of the ability to do automation later comes from automation at the                  |
| 35:03      | beginning. We talked a little bit earlier about the importance of automating decisions.                 |
| 35:07      | I think that that is key. The fact that Rose, you and I both sit and record from the same               |
| 35:16      | place in our relative homes with the same devices that are set in the same ways,                        |
| 35:22      | that are angled in the same manners, and we're sitting in the same kinds of chairs,                     |
| 35:27      | that makes it really, really easy later because I know predictably, give or take,                       |
| 35:36      | what the baseline of our sound is going to be because we always use these same manners for              |
| 35:41      | recording. That, I think, is first and foremost. When it comes to us having a conversation then         |
| 35:50      | and clicking the big red button, we are producing give or take a very similar recorded experience       |
| 35:58      | each time we do it. Content aside, obviously. I think that that kind of automation                      |
| 36:06      | is paramount because it means that I know how to predict what I'm going to be working with              |
| 36:14      | because we keep working the same way each time we record. I don't think we necessarily need to          |
| 36:20      | be prescriptive about use this app or this mic or whatever. I think the key here is                     |
| 36:27      | pick that up, pick that mic, pick that chair, keep using the same damn one because that is going to     |
| 36:33      | be everything later. I think that is really key because it is one of those things. You talked           |
| 36:39      | about earlier, there was 10 minutes of planning, really pay off throughout the day. People find         |
| 36:45      | this a lot of the time with work. If they have the time to sit down and plan it out beforehand,         |
| 36:50      | then often they can avoid repeating, doing things and having to go back and redo something because      |
| 36:56      | it wasn't done right. This plays into a lot of things the same way that you know because we've          |
| 37:03      | set everything up to be the same every time, you can reuse your presets, which makes it a lot easier.   |
| 37:10      | If there is a small environmental change, then it's a minor tweak rather than starting over from        |
| 37:17      | scratch every time because you've got a template essentially that you can use as your basis to          |
| 37:23      | get running. You've nailed it right there. If you don't automate anything else, an EQ preset            |
| 37:28      | is everything. This is where I have to pay homage to my good pal, JF, who made this like at all         |
| 37:35      | possible and who helped me understand the various different settings that we should use in terms of     |
| 37:43      | tuning our voices and loudnesses and so on. He showed me so much and got me all set up in just          |
| 37:49      | the best ways. JF, you're a star. Thank you. If you want to really automate audio, everybody            |
| 37:55      | should just get a JF. If you have that kind of EQ preset, then you have a wonderful baseline to         |
| 38:02      | work from. That will do wonders in terms of making sure that you're getting just the best sound.        |
| 38:11      | Like I said, if you're recording in predictably the same way, then yeah, like you said, Rose,           |
| 38:17      | I'm just tweaking just the tiniest bit. Yes, I could have this in a template,                           |
| 38:22      | but I've actually found that what I do, because I do some sound editing in audacity                     |
| 38:32      | before I bring the audio into Ferrite and I do all the editing on my iPad because I find that           |
| 38:37      | joyful, I am actually duplicating the previous one because I found that using its most recent           |
| 38:47      | tweaks from the template are probably the most valid tweaks to make for this one. I'll probably         |
| 38:56      | tweak it again and then I'll probably tweak it again. Who knows? Maybe I'm going back and forth         |
| 39:00      | and I'll end up exactly where I started at the preset, but I found that starting from the last          |
| 39:06      | time I tweaked it is slightly more optimal than starting from the preset and tweaking it.               |
| 39:12      | So you do have a template. It's just the last episode is the template, which,                           |
| 39:19      | okay, so copy and paste is automation. Congratulations, you've discovered the                           |
| 39:23      | secret. Thank you. That it truly is. Duplicating something that you already have to take things         |
| 39:30      | out and modify it or turn it into a template if there is something that you can reuse again and         |
| 39:35      | again is a really great automation trick. I find with all of these things,                              |
| 39:41      | like starting completely from scratch is really difficult. Like, what should I set my presets to        |
| 39:45      | and so on and so forth? So going through that entire process, well, you've succeeded, you've            |
| 39:50      | done the process, the episode in this case is ready for release. So now that is a template              |
| 39:55      | ready for the next time round, even if it's not a specific template file or you haven't                 |
| 40:01      | named it template, it essentially is, which I think is a really great idea.                             |
| 40:05      | That's very true. And then, I mean, it's slightly more advanced in a more                               |
| 40:11      | templaty kind of way is the fact that you can set up audacity calls the macros,                         |
| 40:16      | which is essentially like a sequence of executed events. And I have found this to be                    |
| 40:23      | incredibly useful. So what I will do having all of the presets the way I like them is I pull my         |
| 40:32      | local recording for me into audacity as an example. I select a little bit of text where it is air       |
| 40:40      | quote silent. It's not silent. Probably my space heater is running or there's ambient sound.            |
| 40:47      | But I select that and then I run a macro. So based on that selection, audacity grabs a noise print      |
| 40:54      | and then it selects all and does noise reduction based on that noise print on everything.               |
| 40:59      | And then it converts to mono. And so now I've got this ready to export wave file                        |
| 41:07      | that I can pull into Ferrite and work with because it's already denoised and converted to mono.         |
| 41:15      | So I'm reducing the amount of file size data that I'm moving around. And then Ferrite takes care of     |
| 41:22      | the EQing and has wonderful functions for strip silence and what it calls tightening where it           |
| 41:32      | advances and pulls together reactions and so on. So that if there's a likely pause between              |
| 41:40      | you saying something and me saying something or vice versa, that all gets tightened up.                 |
| 41:45      | And so with the audacity, like near automated, fully automated post-processing and then pull it         |
| 41:55      | into Ferrite in this, as you say, template with the silence stripped now and the reactions tightened,   |
| 42:06      | it's almost done. So all that remains at that point is for me to listen through because I do            |
| 42:12      | listen through every episode before it goes out. And I use my pencil to just quickly erase any...       |
| 42:22      | I missed one time and the audience was very quick to remind me. If you're taking show notes             |
| 42:28      | on your clacky keyboard, it makes it sound like you're not listening.                                   |
| 42:31      | So got to make sure that the taking of show notes sounds are removed from the background.               |
| 42:38      | Or if we do a retake on something because I biffed a line or started stuttering too much,               |
| 42:47      | the ripple delete function is great because all I have to do is swipe with my pencil on                 |
| 42:52      | both lines, hit ripple, delete on all tracks, and it pulls everything back to the point where           |
| 42:59      | I started deleting from. And so I get to sit back with a pencil on an iPad and edit a podcast.          |
| 43:06      | Feels great. And then from there, I've got... Because I'm using the last episode as a template,         |
| 43:14      | all the show art is already there. I just have to update the episode file title that I want.            |
| 43:21      | And then it exports from Ferrite right into MP3 files that are ready to distribute. And it's            |
| 43:29      | pretty lovely. That is pretty awesome. I feel like I just spewed out a whole bunch of stuff there.      |
| 43:35      | So I am very carefully trying to get some links for the show notes for people because                   |
| 43:40      | I think Ferrite is one of those that people haven't heard of all that much. And also,                   |
| 43:44      | I think a lot of people don't think that it contains all that much automation                           |
| 43:49      | because it is just containing the right tools to allow you to do things incredibly quickly,             |
| 43:55      | as well as some sneaky little bits of automation, which are disguised as functions like ripple          |
| 44:00      | delete. But I think one of the keys there really is the duplication. I'm being able to                  |
| 44:09      | copy and paste and reuse things because you've done it before. So you've got that set up,               |
| 44:14      | ready to go. And also, great automation tip, steal from other people if somebody's sharing              |
| 44:21      | something with you. That's always a nice one to be able to just take that and reuse it.                 |
| 44:26      | I say all this stuff like it's easy and it's not. I would say that it seems easy now because            |
| 44:33      | we're in what you're three of this podcast. I wouldn't say all these things suggesting like,            |
| 44:41      | oh, here's how you go make a podcast tomorrow. It's so easy, no big deal. I mean, you can,              |
| 44:48      | but I think with that production quality that listeners expect, that's harder.                          |
| 44:55      | And so I hope none of this sounds like, geez gang, it's so simple. Why doesn't everyone do it?          |
| 45:04      | Because it isn't. This is all born out of a couple of years of experience of setting all of these       |
| 45:10      | things up, making all of these kinds of decisions about how we're going to work and collaborate         |
| 45:15      | and how I will do all of my things locally and then how all the editing things will happen.             |
| 45:20      | And now it's easy because all of those decisions have been made and the                                 |
| 45:25      | pieces put in place for it. But before that, it was not easy.                                           |
| 45:28      | Well, I do think it's interesting to think of automation beyond the normal tools. We talk               |
| 45:34      | about things like [[AppleScript]] and [[Keyboard Maestro]], yada, yada, yada. But there are a lot              |
| 45:40      | of pro level tools that do have their own automation built in. I'm not real familiar with               |
| 45:46      | Farad. I do most of my audio stuff in Logic. But this is news to me. I didn't realise some              |
| 45:52      | of these tools were already built for you. And whether you do it with a fancy script or the             |
| 45:59      | software itself has a tool where you push a button and it automatically does all its magic,             |
| 46:04      | it's the same result. It's super funny, too, the role that necessity plays. I forgot that               |
| 46:10      | we were deploying an episode on a particular week. I mixed up my weeks, which week an episode           |
| 46:15      | was going out. And I was on holiday with my family. And all I had with me was an iPad.                  |
| 46:20      | So I had to figure it out. How am I going to do this on an iPad? Because previously,                    |
| 46:24      | yeah, I'd been doing everything. And I'm not as fancy and have a Swank Logic setup,                     |
| 46:31      | but I was using GarageBand. And it's got some of the critical path elements of Logic there.             |
| 46:37      | But here I am in what is ostensibly the middle of nowhere with an iPad, thankfully an iPad Pro.         |
| 46:43      | And the task of making a podcast with nothing but this and some recorded audio. So necessity            |
| 46:52      | being the mother of invention helped quite a bit, too, because it also made me discover                 |
| 46:57      | that I really enjoy editing podcasts on an iPad because the advantage of pencil and being able          |
| 47:03      | to just scribble over the waveform that I don't care for and then it goes away is quite lovely.         |
| 47:08      | I think that is something that, you know, it's really difficult, right? You have a setup and            |
| 47:15      | there is something to be said for it. I have a system and it works, so I'm not going to change it.      |
| 47:20      | And that's, you know, if your system genuinely works, then, you know, there's nothing wrong             |
| 47:25      | with that. But sometimes, you know, having to step outside of your present being forced to step         |
| 47:29      | outside of it of not being able to use the setup system allows you to find new tools and faster,        |
| 47:34      | more efficient ways of doing things or just ways of doing things which are more fun. Because at         |
| 47:39      | the end of the day, you know, what's the point in doing stuff if you're not enjoying it? And            |
| 47:43      | that's one of the reasons why I love automating things. You know, it might take me a good 45            |
| 47:48      | minutes to sit down and figure out that macro to have, you know, the folder for the episode             |
| 47:54      | automatically created at the beginning because it pops up and asks me what the episode number is,       |
| 47:57      | so I type in the number and then it creates the folder. But then at the end of the show,                |
| 48:01      | when I've stopped the recording, it magically moves my files into that folder so that I don't need      |
| 48:05      | to worry about it. And then it opens that folder and shows that to me on screen. You know, that's       |
| 48:10      | the sort of thing that you end up getting when you do, you know, take a step back from, well,           |
| 48:14      | I have a system and it works to, can I make this different or better or being forced to make it         |
| 48:20      | different or better? Which, you know, I think I personally have found great benefit from. I'm           |
| 48:25      | sure David, you've found a few instances of, you know, stumbling across an automated solution because,  |
| 48:32      | you know, you accidentally did something or didn't do something and that created an opportunity.        |
| 48:37      | Yeah. I mean, that's often the way I discover things, you know, just having a curious mind.             |
| 48:44      | And, you know, something that Rose and I do, the reason we make a show called Automators is             |
| 48:49      | we both get joy out of just trying things. And not everybody who listened to this show does,            |
| 48:54      | and that's okay. You know, kind of the point of the show is for us to give you the fruits of our        |
| 49:00      | explorations. But it is delightful when something goes awry but becomes better because of it.           |
| 49:08      | Yes. Yes. So I'm sure we've all had instances with home automation in particular, not working           |
| 49:13      | quite the way you expected. That's always an interesting one. Why are my lights turning on              |
| 49:18      | or turning off while I'm sitting here? That's certainly a, I guess I'm going to go and see              |
| 49:23      | this as an opportunity to improve things and, you know, end up with, well, actually, if you             |
| 49:29      | haven't eaten dinner at this time, then I'm going to flash living room lights so that you know that     |
| 49:33      | it's time to go and eat dinner or whatever it is, which, you know, is just even more fun.               |

| 49:51      | Just go to electric.ai/automators. Turning a small business into an empire takes work and         |
| 49:59      | you have to keep your ear to the ground for things that will help you take it to the next level.        |
| 50:04      | But this can be hard when your attention is pulled in different directions,                             |
| 50:08      | because that's the reality of being a boss. The team over at Electric knows small businesses,           |
| 50:14      | maybe like yours, face these challenges. That's why they've solved this problem for you by              |
| 50:18      | operating as your IT department. Instead of spending your time sorting through unused application       |
| 50:24      | licenses, setting up employee laptops and answering never-ending IT questions from your team,           |
| 50:31      | you can build that empire. With Electric acting as your IT department, you can get back to what         |
| 50:36      | you're good at. Plus, you get a really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                   |
| 50:41      | If you're listening to the Automators, that means you're a little geeky and that you have               |
| 50:45      | the answers to IT questions at your workplace. And the problem with that is you also have a job         |
| 50:50      | to do. I know I experienced that myself when I was at the law firm. Everybody came to me for            |
| 50:55      | their IT questions and it was like I had a second job that I wasn't getting paid for.                   |
| 51:00      | If you own a run of business, it's even worse, because then they really expect you to stop and          |
| 51:05      | answer every question when you need to focus on the business. You can solve that problem with           |
| 51:10      | Electric. For Automators listeners, Electric is offering a free pair of Beats Solo 3 headphones         |

| 51:34      | So Scotty, I know that we talked focus modes with some home automation and podcasting,                  |
| 51:39      | but I know that you also really love Agenda and that you have been doing some really cool stuff         |
| 51:45      | with this, because I remember you telling me that you were finding great ways to get stuff              |
| 51:51      | out of [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and do things in ways that were really tricky for a lot of people to do                |
| 51:57      | when you were trying to put it together in a shortcut that everybody could download.                    |
| 52:00      | And I believe that that is out now. So can you tell us how you are automating things with Agenda?       |
| 52:07      | Maybe for people who don't know what the Agenda app is?                                                 |
| 52:11      | Sure. Agenda is a notes app that is entirely date-focused. So every note is tied to the day             |
| 52:20      | in which it was created. And you can even tie it to a specific calendar event and link the two          |
| 52:25      | so that you've got that sort of correlation going on between calendar and Agenda itself.                |
| 52:33      | Agenda has also introduced a lot of sort of quick actions where you can                                 |
| 52:38      | tie Agenda lines in a note to a specific reminder. So there's [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and calendars                   |
| 52:45      | integration that's really cool. But what I love most, most probably, is the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] that it's        |
| 52:53      | got. Now, of course, I would love it so much if there was native shortcuts actions. But the URL         |
| 53:01      | scheme is easy enough to learn and understand. And I think that that makes it really possible to do     |
| 53:09      | some great repeatable things. And probably the most, again, going back to decision automation,          |
| 53:16      | is having a daily note for myself about my plan for the day that is predictably titled                  |
| 53:21      | Wednesday, July 6. I don't know. What day of the week is it Wednesday? Hang on. Where am I?             |
| 53:34      | In time. Yeah. So it's always got the same format in the date at the start.                             |
| 53:38      | That's right. It is always titled EEEEMMM small D comma YYYY. Which means it is always going to be      |
| 53:49      | you know, Saturday, September 3, 2022. Which means that if I want to use automation to append           |
| 53:58      | anything to that, I always know what a note is going to be titled every day. So I don't have            |
| 54:03      | to worry about that. So if I've got like an automation that scoops up an OmniFocus task and             |
| 54:08      | append it to the note, I know the note to target because I know it's title. And it will always be       |
| 54:13      | valid. It will always be correct. And I can automate in that way. And I found that to be just           |
| 54:18      | absolutely wonderful. And then again, you know, having decisions about how are things going to          |
| 54:24      | be presented to me? And do I want to, you know, maybe preface them with emojis that mean certain        |
| 54:30      | things to me? And what items do I want presented to me as checklist items and agenda so that I          |
| 54:35      | can check them off? And now there's no automation, unfortunately, that means that, you know, if I       |
| 54:39      | check it off here, it completes the task in OmniFocus or it marks the reminder is completed.            |
| 54:44      | But that's okay. Clicking a check circle is okay. I can do that. But having it giving myself a little   |
| 54:49      | interface about all of those things and putting them in one place for myself as part of a plan          |
| 54:54      | is a really great way of making sure that I don't miss anything. And that I'm setting myself up for     |
| 55:00      | success on a given particular day. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because, you know, even if you       |
| 55:07      | use an application that has support for, you know, unique IDs for a note, you then have to store that   |
| 55:14      | unique ID to be able to look it up somewhere when you want to append something to it. So by always      |
| 55:21      | using the same title format in something that you can easily recreate because it's the date, then       |
| 55:28      | then that, you know, that just kind of solves that problem entirely, there's no looking it up. It's,    |
| 55:33      | you know, you're just saying, hey, the note with this title, I'm presuming if you had multiple          |
| 55:37      | notes with the same title and agenda, you might run into an issue. But also that you wouldn't do        |
| 55:43      | that because, you know, you give the notes a specific title for reasons that you can find them          |
| 55:47      | again later, which really makes sense. It's sort of a interactive dashboard of your day from,           |
| 55:56      | you know, I've played with this a few times and I really like it. And I'm customising it a bit to       |
| 56:01      | try and do some different things. But, you know, this looks to me like a lot of what people do          |
| 56:06      | with [[Obsidian]] and similar as well. So you have, you know, just your overview of this is today,          |
| 56:11      | you know, you have all the systems which give you all that data and then this just pulls it in so       |
| 56:16      | that you can focus and going back to the focus as we talked about at the beginning on what is it        |
| 56:21      | that is actually important for today, not next week, next year or next century.                         |
| 56:27      | Well, and in the second level of agenda inception, one of the things that I built with this that I'm    |
| 56:33      | really, really quite proud of because it took a while to figure out the URL encoding to be able         |
| 56:37      | to do this, is that next to each of the calendar items for my day is a little link that when clicked    |
| 56:45      | creates a new note in agenda linked to that calendar item and pre-populated with the                    |
| 56:54      | that calendar items, you know, event title, location and meeting notes or like notes that are in the    |
| 56:59      | calendar. Nice. So I can start a meeting just by clicking that link and now I've got a place for        |
| 57:05      | notes for that thing to go. So I can do everything that I want to do from this, like you said,          |
| 57:12      | dashboard for my day. Yeah. I'm gonna steal that because I'm a great artist. And I found that           |
| 57:20      | that is a fantastic way to not just have my day set up, but also for me to be able to do the            |
| 57:27      | things throughout the day that I can, that I predictably will do. You know, if I have this              |
| 57:31      | meeting at one o'clock about this project update, yep, I'm gonna take notes there. So of course,        |
| 57:37      | it would make sense for me to, you know, make it easy for me to be able to do that when the time        |
| 57:42      | comes. I can just click that link and a note will be made. Now, I could have the shortcut at the        |
| 57:47      | beginning and say, you know, which of the events today would you already like to generate a note        |
| 57:51      | for? I guess. But what I really want is for running that daily log to be non-interactive.               |
| 57:59      | Yeah. Because if I get lost in a sea of like, which things would you like to include? Well,             |
| 58:03      | now I'm gonna... Now you have to think about it....off in the thought land. This is, yeah,              |
| 58:07      | running the shortcut, I do the thinking after I have the content in front of me.                        |
| 58:12      | Not before, because I think that trying to predict the content that will be useful means                |
| 58:18      | that I'm in the frame of mind of trying to guess what content will be useful instead of                 |
| 58:24      | using the content and seeing what resonates with me or not. So avoiding that, you know,                 |
| 58:29      | trying to pre-decide because even if I'm right, I wasted time getting to being right.                   |
| 58:36      | And if I'm wrong, there's zero cost to that. All I have to do is ignore it.                             |
| 58:40      | Yes. Or delete it. The backspace key is free and you can hit it as many times as you like.              |
| 58:44      | Yes. And the other thing is, is then if you start the day thinking, all right, this is just             |
| 58:49      | gonna be like a five-minute ad hoc chat with this person. We just put it in the calendar                |
| 58:55      | because we never seem to just be free at the same time. And then it turns out that there's              |
| 58:59      | a thing that you need to discuss and you want to put it into the notes for that and you don't           |
| 59:03      | have a note for that. You still have to somehow create the note, right? So this allows you to           |
| 59:08      | just create the note, you know, you're in the meeting and yes, actually, I do want to take              |
| 59:11      | some notes on this, tap it and you have a note. My only question is, is if that note already            |
| 59:16      | exists, will it open it or does it always create a new note for that meeting?                           |
| 59:22      | It always creates a new note because really what I've done is I've                                      |
| 59:26      | pre-prescribed a link that goes in there that is using the agenda [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] to create a new note.      |
| 59:32      | So it's not smart. It's just a link that says create a note based on this calendar event.               |
| 59:41      | Well, I think I have some homework for the wonderful developers of agenda, which is how                 |
| 59:46      | give Scotty an open or create [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]. So it can open a note if it exists with a specific title      |
| 59:54      | for a specific day and time and if it doesn't, then it'll create it. There we go. And then              |
| 01:00:00   | everything that you have the create function on, you can turn it into open or create and                |
| 01:00:06   | hopefully, hopefully it will magically work. And I'm sure that will be very easy for them               |
| 01:00:10   | to do and they'll have it done before lunch. Thank you.                                                 |
| 01:00:14   | Drew and Alex, I am so sorry. I did not ask her to say that. These people,                              |
| 01:00:23   | Drew and Alex, who develop Agenda are also amazing. And part of Agenda's value to me is                 |
| 01:00:29   | the community around it. I mean, that's true of a lot of the apps that I choose to use.[[Drafts]]         |
| 01:00:35   | has an amazing community around it. OmniFocus has an amazing community around it. There's just so       |
| 01:00:42   | many elements, I think, of picking an app that aren't just, how does it look? How does it feel?         |
| 01:00:48   | How do I use it? What can it do? How does it integrate with the other things that I use?                |
| 01:00:53   | Can I automate it? But also, can I learn about it with other people? And can I be a part of             |
| 01:01:01   | something bigger? There's a real purpose driven element, I think, that goes into my selection           |
| 01:01:06   | of apps these days. And I enjoy that quite a bit. Yes. And I think that that goes into the,          |
| 01:01:12   | like, can I Google this, right? You know, if you're looking to buy something, like,                     |
| 01:01:16   | you try it, like before you go and you buy a big expensive thing or you embark on a really big,         |
| 01:01:21   | crazy project, you do a bit of research, right? And having a community around an app                    |
| 01:01:28   | allows you to do that. And it also means that people will just talk about it and share ideas.           |
| 01:01:32   | Like, I actually have an idea that solves the open or create problem, though it does                    |
| 01:01:38   | potentially slow things down, which, depending on how quickly you need that note when you tap           |
| 01:01:43   | on that link, you may or may not want. But instead of running an agenda URL,                            |
| 01:01:49   | run a shortcut to URL, which looks for a note with those parameters and opens it if it exists.          |
| 01:01:55   | And if it doesn't, then it does the create with the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]]. Because I think                         |
| 01:02:00   | agendas [[URL Schemes]] can, like, find a note, if I remember correctly.                                    |
| 01:02:05   | Not yet. They've started down this path. They've got a [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] that uses,                            |
| 01:02:11   | that will fetch, like, a project ID or a category ID based on where you are in the app, I think.        |
| 01:02:22   | But not a full blown, you know, can I read and find and if yes and if no. But I know that they're       |
| 01:02:28   | thinking about it. And, you know, maybe that comes to fruition someday. I think that would be           |
| 01:02:34   | pretty cool to have the ability to sniff into a database and then do different things based             |
| 01:02:40   | on what you find out of that. But just not quite yet.                                                   |
| 01:02:46   | That's fair enough. And what I really like about this shortcut as well as some people,                  |
| 01:02:50   | you know, we've got a lot of [[Obsidian]] users in the audience. And I'm sure we've got some                |
| 01:02:54   | Roam users and, you know, we've got DEVONthink users. You can actually take exactly what you've         |
| 01:02:58   | done here and repurpose it for any of those applications. DEVONthink has really well                    |
| 01:03:04   | documented [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] support. [[Obsidian]] has [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] support, though you might want one of the        |
| 01:03:10   | extra plugins for that to improve it. And, you know, I'm sure for a lot of applications that            |
| 01:03:17   | people are using, it'll either have [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] support or shortcut support or [[AppleScript]]              |
| 01:03:22   | support or something. And yeah, you can run an [[AppleScript]], you know, quite easily through a           |
| 01:03:29   | [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]], you know, either wrap it in a shortcut or something. So, you know, I think that this,       |
| 01:03:36   | you know, creating an interactive dashboard for your day automatically, which, you know,                |
| 01:03:43   | shows you what you need. But it's also not automatically updating necessarily, because                  |
| 01:03:48   | that's one of the things that I hate, right? You're looking at something and just as like               |
| 01:03:52   | your eyes have found the bit that you need and focused on it, it disappears in front of you.            |
| 01:03:55   | And that can be really tricky. And, you know, going back and looking, you know, as I've gone            |
| 01:04:01   | through my day and having, for example, a meeting crossed through because it's in the past. Okay,       |
| 01:04:07   | but actually, it didn't happen because we were all like coming out of another meeting and we were       |
| 01:04:11   | like, okay, like we need time to go grab some lunch and take a brain break before we come back          |
| 01:04:16   | to this. We'll just postpone this, but nobody's updated the calendar event because there are            |
| 01:04:19   | three of us involved. So, you know, and it's been automatically crossed out. And now I can't            |
| 01:04:25   | do the thing with it, or it's just hidden from me. That can be quite frustrating. So, I like the        |
| 01:04:30   | semi-static nature of this, the fact that, you know, it's created. And that's what it was like          |
| 01:04:34   | at that point in time, because I'm guessing there's nothing stopping you running this for a second      |
| 01:04:39   | time in that day. I'm prefixing or, you know, prefixing or suffixing the title of the first one         |
| 01:04:47   | with original. And so that you've then got, you know, version 2.0 of your day, if something             |
| 01:04:53   | significantly changes at like 10.30 in the morning, then you can do that again.                         |
| 01:04:57   | It's true. I could. But because I will also append things to it based on the day, I would               |
| 01:05:03   | prefer not to. I also like the fact that it is a snapshot, because then, you know, if a meeting         |
| 01:05:08   | cancels or reschedules, well, then I'll go to that line. I'll select the text and put it in             |
| 01:05:13   | strike through. And then that way, like later, I know. So, it's the fact that it is a snapshot          |
| 01:05:20   | honours what my plan was at the beginning of the day. And then I can look at the note and see            |
| 01:05:24   | throughout the day what happened. Certainly by the time this is heard by anyone, it will also           |
| 01:05:30   | be posted on my blog. I'll get you a link to put in show notes, is my rapid log shortcut,               |
| 01:05:36   | which does exactly that. It appends to today's note. And based on whether that                          |
| 01:05:44   | what I rapid log is prefixed by a dash or not, it will also make a task in either OmniFocus             |
| 01:05:52   | or [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], whatever you like. I'll probably share it as link for [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] so that no one            |
| 01:05:58   | feels compelled to have to purchase or download OmniFocus if you're not an OmniFocus user like          |
| 01:06:05   | I am. But it'll create a reminder in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. And then it will create the task as like a              |
| 01:06:13   | checkmark item in Agenda with the body of the text linked to the reminder in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. So,             |
| 01:06:20   | you could just click it and go there. That way, you can see the task in either place,                   |
| 01:06:26   | either in your Agenda dashboard for the day or in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]. And then it also honours                    |
| 01:06:34   | inline, let's say Taskpaper styling, so that if I was to type dash pick up the groceries               |
| 01:06:45   | at flagged at errands, it will make the task in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] flagged with the title,                       |
| 01:06:55   | pick up whatever I said it was, and with the tag of errands already done for you.                       |
| 01:07:01   | And then also added in Agenda, but without any of that Taskpapery stuff,                               |
| 01:07:06   | it'll just say pick up groceries with a checkmark circle, but the text is linked to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].          |
| 01:07:14   | And again, also OmniFocus. But I think that that is a really cool way for me to not have to worry       |
| 01:07:21   | about when I add something or when I have a thought, where does it go? Because not only am I            |
| 01:07:29   | adding these things into an appended to a note for my day, but they're also automatically               |
| 01:07:37   | prefixed with a timestamp. So, I have a sense of when in the day I logged that so that I know           |
| 01:07:44   | what I was thinking at the time. And it allows me to see, oh, wow, these eight things were all added    |
| 01:07:50   | at 9.54 p.m. Okay, I must be doing some thinking at 9.54 p.m. then. How do I either move that           |
| 01:07:57   | thinking into a better time of day for me or honour the fact that I'm doing a lot of thinking at 9.54    |
| 01:08:01   | p.m. and create an automated focus mode for that or something? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.         |
| 01:08:07   | And yeah, particularly the linking back from that. So, you're just snapshotting that you                |
| 01:08:14   | captured that thing. You're not necessarily having a snapshot that you did the thing,                   |
| 01:08:18   | but you can go and see it. And if it's been assigned a date or it transformed since then,               |
| 01:08:22   | then you'll have the latest version of that plus what it originally was. And also,                      |
| 01:08:31   | I think a lot of people will appreciate that you're sharing it as a [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] action because            |
| 01:08:35   | [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] is on everyone's devices. And the one thing I wish shortcuts could do is give you             |
| 01:08:40   | sort of like a preview of what the shortcut action might be like for an app that you don't              |
| 01:08:45   | have installed because right now, if I downloaded, I don't know, an awesome new app or a shortcut       |
| 01:08:53   | that contained awesome new app shortcut action, I would have absolutely no idea what even app           |
| 01:08:58   | that action came from, let alone what action that is. And if I downloaded the app that it would be      |
| 01:09:04   | magically auto-updated, but I'd have to have some kind of information for that to start with,           |
| 01:09:10   | which at the moment, sadly, I don't. But hopefully, the Shortcuts team will be able to work on that     |
| 01:09:16   | at some point in the future, even just telling me what app that action is from would be a really        |
| 01:09:22   | great start to know where I can go get that and try it out.                                             |
| 01:09:27   | I wonder if app clips could be used for that sort of thing.                                             |
| 01:09:32   | That would be an interesting idea. When you download a shortcut, if you don't have the app              |
| 01:09:36   | for the action, it automatically puts a tiny app clip on your device that would just sort               |
| 01:09:42   | of like, it just sort of simulates what that action looks like, but it then has a strike                |
| 01:09:48   | through or a little red icon on it that says, you know, download the app to get this action             |
| 01:09:54   | or something. Could be nice.                                                                            |
| 01:09:56   | Agenda is a really powerful application. And we just have this abundance of riches now.                 |
| 01:10:01   | There's so many great apps out there. I mean, we talked too much probably about [[Obsidian]],               |
| 01:10:05   | but there's a whole world of like linked note apps showing up with various levels of, you know,         |
| 01:10:12   | user interface and automation tools. I'm glad you were able to share that with us today,                |
| 01:10:17   | because we haven't had anybody on to talk about Agenda. And I think that is an app that is              |
| 01:10:21   | definitely worth considering. Either way, we are the Automators podcast. You can find us over at        |

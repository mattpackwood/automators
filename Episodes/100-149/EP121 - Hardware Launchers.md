| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the automation podcast about automating all the things to           |
| 00:06      | automatically do all of your automated work for you, and maybe some other automation thrown            |
| 00:11      | in there.                                                                                              |
| 00:12      | I'm Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                        |
| 00:14      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                               |
| 00:15      | I felt that intro was hardly automatic.                                                                |
| 00:17      | I mean, it was great.                                                                                  |
| 00:19      | Well, that's the thing.                                                                                |
| 00:21      | We don't script this show.                                                                             |
| 00:22      | We have an outline.                                                                                    |
| 00:23      | It's more of a guideline that a set of rules, but yeah, this is how automation goes, right?            |
| 00:29      | You start by solving one problem, then you realise that the problem is actually something              |
| 00:33      | totally different, and voila, suddenly you've automated a whole bunch of stuff.                        |
| 00:38      | Automation is so fun, Ros.                                                                             |
| 00:39      | I mean, just the other night, again, my refrigerator door was left open.                               |
| 00:44      | The alarm went off.                                                                                    |
| 00:45      | I didn't hear it.                                                                                      |
| 00:46      | Things in my house turned red.                                                                         |
| 00:48      | My wife said, what is that?                                                                            |
| 00:49      | And I told her, and she looked at me like I was kind of cool, and I like that.                         |
| 00:54      | I like looking cool to my wife.                                                                        |
| 00:56      | Excellent.                                                                                             |
| 00:57      | Home acceptance factor, winning right there.                                                           |
| 00:59      | There we go.                                                                                           |
| 01:00      | Anyway, today we are here to talk about automation, particularly hardware launchers.                   |
| 01:07      | In the last episode, we went into the discussion of some of the software keyboard launchers            |
| 01:13      | we got out there, and we thought it'd be fun to follow that up with the physical buttons               |
| 01:20      | you press that relate in automation, and there's quite a few of them.                                  |
| 01:25      | There's lots of different ways to go around it.                                                        |
| 01:26      | We've got a lot of hardware we're going to be talking about today.                                     |
| 01:29      | This may be a protect your wallet kind of episode.                                                     |
| 01:32      | You may hear about something that you feel like you need.                                              |
| 01:34      | So you have been warned, but I think this will be fun.                                                 |
| 01:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:39      | Yeah, it definitely will.                                                                              |
| 01:40      | And it's one of those things, you know, [[Chris Lawley\|Christopher Lawley]] kind of, you know, dangled the white        |
| 01:45      | rabbit in front of us a little bit when he was on, because he was talking about macro-pads              |
| 01:49      | and fancy keyboards and so on.                                                                         |
| 01:51      | But there is a lot more to hardware launchers than, you know, just dedicated hardware, because         |
| 01:57      | a lot of this can start right back with the hardware that you already have in front of                 |
| 02:01      | you, namely your keyboard, your mouse or truck pad.                                                    |
| 02:05      | And you know, if you still got one of those, maybe even a touch bar, and you can do a heck             |
| 02:09      | of a lot with those to automate stuff and launch things and run magic right before your                |
| 02:15      | very eyes and under your fingertips.                                                                   |
| 02:17      | All right, so let's dig in with the stuff you probably already have on your desk.                      |
| 02:23      | And starting with that, I think would be the keyboard, you know, we talk about this all                |
| 02:28      | the time, but your keyboard is the ultimate hardware automation launcher.                              |
| 02:33      | And you know, keyboard shortcuts are always a discussion regarding automation.                         |
| 02:38      | There's a lot of great ways to do them.                                                                |
| 02:41      | You know, like you said, we've done cool stuff in the past, like launching pallets                     |
| 02:45      | out of [[Keyboard Maestro]], but just the actual hardware itself is worth a discussion.                    |
| 02:52      | And I think a big piece of this for folks who haven't discovered it yet is the [[hyperkey]].               |
| 02:57      | And [[Brett Terpstra]] is the first one I heard mention this, but I think he got it somewhere                 |
| 03:01      | else.                                                                                                  |
| 03:02      | But the hyperkey is what Brett refers to as the combination of shift, control, option,                 |
| 03:07      | and command those four keys together, which are fairly close on your keyboard.                         |
| 03:11      | But any keyboard shortcut that starts with holding down for modifier keys is going to                  |
| 03:17      | be a little bit of a, you know, finger pretzel to get that done.                                       |
| 03:21      | So Brett's idea or somebody's idea was to remap the caps lock key to press those four                  |
| 03:27      | buttons together.                                                                                      |
| 03:28      | And so you press those four together, then you've got a full keyboard of automation triggers           |
| 03:36      | that no other app has ever used because this is a feature that just doesn't exist anywhere             |
| 03:41      | else.                                                                                                  |
| 03:42      | And I think it's a really great idea.                                                                  |
| 03:44      | Yeah, it really is, because it's one of those things where adding a new keyboard shortcut              |
| 03:49      | and just to be clear in Mac system preferences or system settings, depending on which version          |
| 03:54      | you're running, if you open up the keyboard system preference pane, then you can actually              |
| 04:00      | assign keyboards to pretty much anything in any application you like, or rather than                   |
| 04:05      | assign keyboards, you can assign keyboard shortcuts, that's the word.                                  |
| 04:08      | And this is really useful, and also you can turn off keyboard shortcuts.                               |
| 04:12      | So for example, turning the dock hiding on and off is something I never, ever, ever want               |
| 04:16      | to do.                                                                                                 |
| 04:17      | I will find another way to do it when I need to do it.                                                 |
| 04:21      | But doing it with command option D, no thank you.                                                      |
| 04:24      | So I've just unchecked that.                                                                           |
| 04:26      | If you just uncheck it, then it just doesn't run.                                                      |
| 04:28      | But you can of course change these two other things as well.                                           |
| 04:31      | And there's a section here called app shortcuts.                                                       |
| 04:34      | And app shortcuts will let you then, if you click on the plus, you can choose a specific               |
| 04:38      | application or you can choose all applications.                                                        |
| 04:41      | And then you can type in the menu title of the menu command that you want to run.                      |
| 04:47      | And this is just very useful for the, this application has this function, which is under               |
| 04:52      | this keyboard shortcut.                                                                                |
| 04:53      | And then my brain thinks that it's under that keyboard shortcut in another app.                        |
| 04:57      | So I'll do that there.                                                                                 |
| 04:58      | But you combine that with the hyper key and bam, you're everywhere because the hyper key,              |
| 05:04      | the idea is you can still use your Kepler's lock key like a Kepler's lock key.                         |
| 05:08      | So if you just tap it, then it'll toggle it on or off.                                                 |
| 05:12      | So if it was off, it'll be on and if it was on, it'll be off.                                          |
| 05:14      | But if you press and hold it and then press something else, then it runs a keyboard shortcut           |
| 05:18      | because it's the combination of the keys together.                                                     |
| 05:22      | And so you don't lose any functionality, you're only gaining functionality.                            |
| 05:27      | And I think that's what's really for me so magical about this.                                         |
| 05:30      | And for people who are going, okay, but how do I, how do I set this up so that the capsule             |
| 05:34      | key does that?                                                                                         |
| 05:35      | I'm just going to say the magic words, which is [[BetterTouchTool]].                                     |
| 05:39      | It's a magic name really, [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                           |
| 05:43      | If you don't have it, it's going to be very useful for a bunch of the stuff that we're                 |
| 05:46      | going to talk about here, but it actually has a hyper key function built in and I'll                   |
| 05:51      | link folks to the docs on that so that you can just set that up and bam, off you go.                   |
| 05:57      | But it is really useful and depending on your keyboard layout, you may not have lots of                |
| 06:02      | keys or you may have loads of keys, but imagine using that in combination with specifically            |
| 06:08      | the number keys on a number pad if you've got one of those.                                            |
| 06:11      | Or if you just have a keyboard that it just has letters, some basic function keys and                  |
| 06:19      | the arrow keys and there's no home or page up, page down, or even function keys, you're                |
| 06:24      | going to want to get as many keyboard shortcuts out of this as you can with such a small space.        |
| 06:29      | That's why the hyper key really comes into play.                                                       |
| 06:31      | I try to use hyper key shortcuts for global shortcuts.                                                 |
| 06:35      | I have tons of shortcuts that are triggered in specific apps and I do this largely using               |
| 06:41      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] because you can have scripts that only run when a certain app is active               |
| 06:47      | and then you can apply shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 06:49      | So when I'm in mail, option D will do something that when I'm in Safari does something different.      |
| 06:58      | So those key mappings change depending on the application, but for me, a hyper key shortcut            |
| 07:04      | is one that I want to be able to run anywhere at any time.                                             |
| 07:08      | So it's like, I almost have this thing where it's like, is it worthy of the hyper key?                 |
| 07:14      | The setups is one that's absolutely worthy.                                                            |
| 07:16      | I think we're going to do a show on setups because I've been thinking about this a lot                 |
| 07:19      | lately, but just where like, before I start recording today, I hit hyper key plus S, which             |
| 07:25      | is the setups conflict palette and [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                   |
| 07:28      | And I said typed AU for automators and it loaded all the apps to do a recording of the                 |
| 07:33      | show and the recording software and turned off the other apps I didn't need.                           |
| 07:37      | And it just, you know, just set everything up for me.                                                  |
| 07:40      | You do this with bunch, but you can trigger them the same way with the hyper key.                      |
| 07:45      | So it's just really fun to, you know, to use that, that additional hyper key.                          |
| 07:50      | And like Rose said, you can do a [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                    |
| 07:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 07:54      | You touch, you touch on something else though that I want to mention, and that is your keyboard        |
| 07:58      | itself.                                                                                                |
| 07:59      | Like, you know, there are different keyboards out there.                                               |
| 08:01      | Let's talk about the world of Apple keyboards before we get into some of the others.                   |
| 08:06      | But the, you know, Apple has some great keyboards they're making these days and they've done           |
| 08:11      | a good job of remapping the function row to common features that you would want, you know,             |
| 08:18      | starting and stopping music and turning up and down brightness, things like that.                      |
| 08:22      | But you can also toggle those to be function keys if you want.                                         |
| 08:27      | And there's even a system setting.                                                                     |
| 08:29      | So if you'd want, like maybe you're, maybe you're in Final Cut and you want to remap                   |
| 08:35      | the function keys to do specific functions related to Final Cut, you can do that.                      |
| 08:41      | And then basically disable the built-in functions or toggle them off.                                  |
| 08:45      | And then you've got a row of 12 keys there on the smallest keyboard that you can use                   |
| 08:50      | as custom keys without any modification, you know.                                                     |
| 08:53      | And then, then think about adding control option, you know, hyper key to those function                |
| 08:58      | keys and you've got, you know, 24, 36, 48 different buttons you can map out right there.               |
| 09:05      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 09:07      | And it's one of those things where what I would highly recommend people do when they                   |
| 09:10      | start going and adding these keyboard shortcuts is the temptation is to go, oh, right.                 |
| 09:15      | And I'm just going to add all of the keyboard shortcuts.                                               |
| 09:17      | And then you don't use any of them because you don't remember them.                                    |
| 09:20      | It's just like add one at a time and give yourself like, I don't know, five minutes                    |
| 09:24      | of using it or half an hour of using it, however long it works best for you.                           |
| 09:29      | And then add the next one or just add a few and come back a day later and add a few more.              |
| 09:32      | Because it's so tempting to just go and add a load more.                                               |
| 09:36      | But then you forget how many keyboard shortcuts are there.                                             |
| 09:38      | And I feel like actually, I'm going to have to check after the show because my work laptop             |
| 09:43      | is totally flat, so I can't actually boot it to check which application I've got installed             |
| 09:48      | on there.                                                                                              |
| 09:49      | But there are some great apps where if you press and hold the command key, just like                   |
| 09:53      | on iOS and iPad OS, you get a little pop over on screen, which will show you all the keyboard          |
| 09:58      | shortcuts that you have set up for that app or the come default in that app, which is also             |
| 10:03      | very useful.                                                                                           |
| 10:04      | If you've got something where it's like, why is this not working?                                      |
| 10:06      | You can find out what the conflicting application is and go, oh, I'm going to go disable you           |
| 10:10      | because you don't get to run that keyboard shortcut.                                                   |
| 10:12      | I installed something that Day that tried to take over command shift four, which is my                 |
| 10:16      | favourite screenshot action.                                                                            |
| 10:18      | And yeah, that didn't last very long before I turned off that particular keyboard shortcut             |
| 10:22      | in that app.                                                                                           |
| 10:23      | But yeah, it's really good to be able to build this stuff up over time.                                |
| 10:29      | And also the other thing I'd recommend is think of what keyboard shortcuts you're already              |
| 10:33      | familiar with from other applications and then reuse those.                                            |
| 10:37      | So one that I use very frequently in PHPStorm, which I use at work is command shift D, which           |
| 10:43      | reformats the file or the selected piece of text.                                                      |
| 10:47      | So if I'm thinking of like, oh, I want to add a reformat action into any other app, then               |
| 10:52      | I'm going to use that same keyboard shortcut for consistency across those applications.                |
| 10:57      | And that makes it a lot easier for me to go ahead and do that sort of thing because I've               |
| 11:02      | already got that muscle memory from all of those other applications.                                   |
| 11:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 11:06      | I mean, and what Rose said about mastering one before you pick up another one is absolutely            |
| 11:12      | true.                                                                                                  |
| 11:13      | I recommend, you know, you don't start a new one until the one you just created becomes                |
| 11:18      | second nature.                                                                                         |
| 11:20      | But that's honestly, I think one of the attractions of the Stream Deck, and we'll talk about the       |
| 11:24      | Stream Deck later in this episode, but because the Stream Deck allows you to create a graphical        |
| 11:28      | icon for the button, that makes the internalisation process much easier and allows them to switch      |
| 11:36      | based on app and, you know, the buttons can become dynamic.                                            |
| 11:39      | But I think that's one of the reasons why all of us nerds are so excited about the Stream              |
| 11:42      | Deck is because you don't have to like internalise, well, what is, you know, option F10 do again?      |
| 11:49      | You know, I can't remember and so it basically allows you to graphically represent it.                 |
| 11:54      | But now Rose mentioned earlier the extended keyboard, well, that's another entire set                  |
| 11:59      | of hardware triggers, right?                                                                           |
| 12:01      | Because with the extended keyboard, you've got function keys F13 through F19 that you                  |
| 12:06      | don't have on the standard keyboard, plus you have the entire number pad.                              |
| 12:10      | And you can go into applications and set those numbers or maybe say hold down option and               |
| 12:16      | press those numbers to trigger automations.                                                            |
| 12:20      | That gives you, in effect, another whole set of buttons you can use for automation.                    |
| 12:25      | In fact, that for me is always the siren song of the extended keyboard.                                |
| 12:30      | I don't like that I have to move my hand, you know, across another six inches to get                   |
| 12:34      | to my mouse, but those extra buttons are so useful, Rose.                                              |
| 12:39      | Well, I have a little tip for folks.                                                                   |
| 12:41      | If people think, oh yeah, I love the idea of a number pad, but like moving my hand those               |
| 12:45      | extra six inches, you know, depending on your desk and, you know, various different things,            |
| 12:50      | those extra six inches might make life very uncomfortable for you.                                     |
| 12:53      | And the last thing I want to do is recommend you get repetitive strain injury, but you                 |
| 12:56      | can buy separate number pads.                                                                          |
| 13:00      | And if you buy a separate number pad, then you could even put it on the left side of                   |
| 13:04      | your keyboard.                                                                                         |
| 13:05      | So you could have mouse on the right hand side.                                                        |
| 13:08      | If you're right handed a trackpad on a trackpad, could be a trackpad, we'll get to the advantage       |
| 13:12      | of a trackpad animals a little bit, but you could put a number pad on the left hand side.              |
| 13:18      | You can get USB ones, you can get Bluetooth ones, or you can get like dedicated macro                  |
| 13:21      | palette ones, which have got blank key caps.                                                           |
| 13:23      | So there's there's nothing written on the keys.                                                        |
| 13:26      | And yeah, like I would say that if folks are interested in the idea, you can pick these                |
| 13:31      | up for less than 10 bucks on Amazon.                                                                   |
| 13:33      | So folks should definitely consider this as something to try out and see.                              |
| 13:39      | And yeah, you know, it might be a really useful pro power tool for you.                                |
| 13:45      | Or it may not work, but at less than 10 bucks, I would say it's worth a try if you're interested       |
| 13:49      | in it.                                                                                                 |
| 13:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:51      | And you could also, I got, I'm going to stop talking about the Stream Decks till we get                |
| 13:54      | to the Stream Decks, but obviously you can also put all that stuff on a Stream Deck and                |
| 13:59      | you don't need to go to the number pad.                                                                |
| 14:02      | The one challenge with using an extended keyboard is if you have a laptop and you get                  |
| 14:08      | reliant on automation triggers off the extended keyboard, and then you go into laptop mode,            |
| 14:13      | they're gone.                                                                                          |
| 14:14      | You know, so you need to have alternate shortcuts for those.                                           |
| 14:18      | So in essence, you learn two sets of shortcuts, one when you've got the tiny keyboard and one          |
| 14:22      | when you've got the big keyboard, which can become a gating issue for people.                          |
| 14:27      | But honestly, it's not that difficult.                                                                 |
| 14:29      | You just, you know, like for instance, let's say you're using the F 16 through 19 keys,                |
| 14:34      | well, maybe you move those to, you know, somewhere else when you're in the laptop mode.                |
| 14:40      | That can be done, but it is like an additional kind of complication that comes with it.                |
| 14:45      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                          |
| 14:46      | And it's one of those things where, you know, you need to figure out what it is.                       |
| 14:51      | Personally I find that the things closest to the command key on the left-hand side are                 |
| 14:56      | the ones that I'm going to want to use the most frequently.                                            |
| 14:59      | And I am also very pleased to be able to update us and report in that my work laptop is powered        |
| 15:04      | on.                                                                                                    |
| 15:05      | And I was able to double check the name of the app that cheats when I hold the command                 |
| 15:08      | key is called cheat sheet and it's by Media Atelier, which is a French company.                        |
| 15:13      | But it just pops up on your screen and shows you all the keyboard shortcuts.                           |
| 15:17      | But the reason why is because for most of us, we're going to be using the command key                  |
| 15:22      | a lot.                                                                                                 |
| 15:23      | So I want to keep everything over on that left-hand side pretty much.                                  |
| 15:27      | And so the further away it is, it still thinks that I'm going to be using definitely, but              |
| 15:31      | it thinks I will use less frequently than the things that, you know, I'm using all                     |
| 15:37      | the time.                                                                                              |
| 15:38      | If I have something that I want to be able to use all of the time, I put that to the                   |
| 15:42      | left, not to the right, because the right is what will go missing when I am on my laptop's             |
| 15:47      | internal keyboard or something else.                                                                   |
| 15:49      | For me, it's groupings of modifier keys that are really key.                                           |
| 15:53      | Like I am a big fan of the JKL semi-colon keys like gamers use to move their carry.                    |
| 16:00      | If you ever talked to someone who does PC gaming, JKL is like the strafing, stopping                   |
| 16:05      | and moving, then the eyes move forward.                                                                |
| 16:08      | People like manage, it's almost like a joystick, but it's a keyboard version.                          |
| 16:13      | I always use WASD for that.                                                                            |
| 16:15      | It's kind of crazy that, I mean, it makes sense that there's both sides, but I've never                |
| 16:18      | heard of IJKL.                                                                                         |
| 16:19      | It was always WASD for me.                                                                             |
| 16:22      | Well, so people do that, I guess maybe it depends if you're right or left-handed.                      |
| 16:26      | But for me, like, window management for me is control and command, which I can hit with                |
| 16:31      | my left hand, and then JKL and the surrounding keys to do window management.                           |
| 16:36      | I've got different like setups, like when I'm processing email, I use command and option               |
| 16:43      | plus WASD.                                                                                             |
| 16:45      | So it just depends in my head, I've got these combinations of modifier keys.                           |
| 16:50      | And I think that's something we all need to just figure out for ourselves.                             |
| 16:54      | If we're going to talk about keyboards, I want to mention briefly, and we talked about                 |
| 16:57      | this at length when Brett was on [[Brett Terpstra]], the ultimate hacking keyboard.                        |
| 17:03      | That is a keyboard built around this whole idea, and it's got, I think, five different                 |
| 17:08      | keyboards inside of it where you can rotate between them.                                              |
| 17:12      | So you can absolutely use one of the keyboards to become a mouse control device, and one               |
| 17:19      | of them to be regular keyboard, and two of them to become entire sets of macros.                       |
| 17:25      | If you really want to go down that rabbit hole, you can.                                               |
| 17:29      | I can officially say this now, because I've had it in my cart in the past, I had a tab                 |
| 17:34      | open for it.                                                                                           |
| 17:35      | I have somehow cured myself of the desire to buy an ultimate hacking keyboard.                         |
| 17:40      | I keep going back and looking at it, but they're super expensive.                                      |
| 17:44      | And then it's a cable, so you've got another cable stretched out.                                      |
| 17:48      | But the whole thing looks like the ultimate hacking keyboard.                                          |
| 17:51      | I don't think I want something like that on my desk, and with my collection, my flock                  |
| 17:56      | of Stream Decks, I don't think I need one, but that's another way to go about it, if                   |
| 18:02      | you want.                                                                                              |
| 18:03      | And some people really love that ultimate hacking keyboard.                                            |
| 18:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 18:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 18:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 18:09      | So there are other alternatives as well.                                                               |
| 18:10      | There's any keyboard that you could program with "Viya" or "Via", as we talked about when Chris            |
| 18:15      | Holly was on the show, and there's all sorts of things out there.                                      |
| 18:20      | But I definitely recommend spend a little bit more time with your current keyboard.                    |
| 18:25      | And also, the other thing that I want to just say before we move on is check out the different         |
| 18:33      | apps that you can use to modify that built-in keyboard as well.                                        |
| 18:37      | So I mentioned [[BetterTouchTool]] before, and there's a very good reason for this.                      |
| 18:41      | It can do things like differentiate between the left command key and the right command                 |
| 18:45      | key.                                                                                                   |
| 18:46      | And so you can have, when I press left command R, it does this, when I press right command             |
| 18:50      | R, it does that.                                                                                       |
| 18:52      | And this may work very well for you.                                                                   |
| 18:55      | It may not work very well for you, but it's certainly something that is worth considering              |
| 18:59      | when you're looking at this stuff and going, oh, I want to be able to increase the possibility         |
| 19:05      | of the things that I can do.                                                                           |
| 19:07      | Well, you've got two sides of your keyboard, when you combine them differently, you can                |
| 19:13      | have different things happen.                                                                          |
| 19:14      | So there's no need to rush out and spend loads of money.                                               |
| 19:17      | At this point in the show, you're maybe in for $10 unless you went and bought a super                  |
| 19:20      | fancy macro pad because you're ready for a later part of the show.                                     |
| 19:26      | But yeah, if you spent any money, I'd say [[BetterTouchTool]] and maybe a number pad, maybe.             |
| 19:32      | Or maybe something else that we're going to talk about in a little bit will pique your                 |
| 19:35      | interest.                                                                                              |
| 19:36      | Yeah, we're going to do more on [[BetterTouchTool]] on the show in the future, but that's                |
| 19:41      | one that's going to come up repeatedly throughout this episode, and you can get it as part             |
| 19:45      | of your set app subscription or you can just buy it outright.                                          |
| 19:48      | And if you want to get serious with hardware buttons, that's an app you want to have.                  |
| 19:55      | This episode of Alternatives is brought to you by Electric.                                            |
| 19:59      | When you think of the phrase Boss Move, you might think of making a bold business decision             |
| 20:03      | or maybe giving a great presentation in front of a big crowd.                                          |
| 20:06      | The reality is sometimes being a boss in a small business means sorting out the orange                 |
| 20:10      | juice you spilled on your own laptop keyboard or helping a member of staff with setting                |
| 20:13      | up their new PC.                                                                                       |
| 20:15      | The team over at Electric know small businesses, maybe like yours, face these challenges.              |
| 20:19      | That's why they've solved this problem for you by operating as your IT department, instead             |
| 20:23      | of spending your time sorting through unused application licenses, setting up employee                 |
| 20:26      | laptops and answering never-ending IT questions from your team, you can build that empire.             |
| 20:31      | Electric acting is your IT department, you can get back to what you're good at, plus                   |
| 20:35      | you get a really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                                        |
| 20:40      | Even if you are fabulous at IT, unless your job is literally being an IT department, you               |
| 20:44      | should learn to delegate and delegate this to somebody else if you can at all.                         |
| 20:49      | Electric is perfect for those people who are trying to do all of the things at once because            |
| 20:54      | while you can stack a bunch of hats on your head, you're going to be better off focusing               |
| 20:58      | on the things that you can do and only you can do.                                                     |
| 21:02      | And there are plenty of times that I would have loved Electric.                                        |
| 21:04      | So if you're running a small business and you've got folks using computers, you should                 |
| 21:08      | check out Electric.                                                                                    |

| 21:24      | Thanks to Electric for their support of this show.                                                     |
| 21:28      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 21:29      | So we talked a little bit about Macro Pads in the last segment.                                        |
| 21:34      | Chris talked about them a few episodes ago, but let's go there.                                        |
| 21:38      | So Rose, explain to me the strange world of Macro Pads.                                                |
| 21:42      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 21:44      | So if you think of a keyboard, only instead of looking at the keys and seeing like an                  |
| 21:48      | ampersand and a seven or a G or a full stop or whatever it is, you just see a picture                  |
| 21:54      | of a puppy or a bin or maybe you don't see any pictures at all and you think, okay, well,              |
| 22:01      | what does this do?                                                                                     |
| 22:02      | Well, if it's the bin, then that might give you a bit of an idea that it is the recycle                |
| 22:06      | bin.                                                                                                   |
| 22:07      | It's going to empty the trash, right?                                                                  |
| 22:08      | Or maybe it's a delete key or a backspace key, but a puppy, what does the puppy do?                    |
| 22:12      | Well, if it's a puppy, you could program that to do anything you want.                                 |
| 22:17      | It could even, you know, with the magic of home automation.                                            |
| 22:20      | I don't know, like, oh, unlatch a dog door or something so that your dog can come in                   |
| 22:25      | and go out.                                                                                            |
| 22:26      | I have no idea.                                                                                        |
| 22:27      | But you could do anything you like with it.                                                            |
| 22:30      | So a Macro Pad is basically part of a keyboard or a whole keyboard, maybe with a different             |
| 22:36      | layout that is just customised to do whatever you want.                                                |
| 22:41      | And the way that it does this really depends on the Macro Pad and how you set it up.                   |
| 22:47      | So a way to do this would be to have it mapped to something like the hyper key and then a              |
| 22:53      | number of other keys as well, and then have those keyboard shortcuts run things for you.               |
| 23:01      | Or you could just have something like [[BetterTouchTool\|BetterTouchTool's]] sit there and when a particular               |
| 23:06      | key code is sent, because every key on a keyboard will send a key code when it's pressed.              |
| 23:11      | So when that particular key code is sent, then a [[BetterTouchTool]] goes, oh, right,                    |
| 23:15      | this keyboard sent this key code.                                                                      |
| 23:16      | Bam, I'm going to go do that.                                                                          |
| 23:19      | And off it goes.                                                                                       |
| 23:20      | And so, you know, the Macro Pad is ingenious because it can take three keys.                           |
| 23:28      | It could take one key or it could take a hundred and one keys, however many keys you want to           |
| 23:34      | do something, and that's whatever you want.                                                            |
| 23:36      | So I'm sure some folks will have seen over the course of the pandemic, there were a bunch              |
| 23:42      | of Kickstarters that popped up for like the ultimate Zoom mute button or something like that, where       |
| 23:46      | it was just like this big red button.                                                                  |
| 23:49      | And it was just basically sending the key code for the keyboard shortcut to mute Zoom.                 |
| 23:53      | That was it.                                                                                           |
| 23:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 23:55      | Like, so, you know, that's all it was doing.                                                           |
| 23:57      | So it was sending if you're on the Mac a command option A. And that's what it did.                     |
| 24:02      | Basically that's how they managed to get away without having to install software and stuff,            |
| 24:06      | or maybe they did have to install software so that something else could interact with                  |
| 24:09      | Zoom and send that keyboard shortcut when it received the particular key code or whatever.             |
| 24:14      | But that's what they did.                                                                              |
| 24:15      | And if you think about it, it would be really cool to have a nice big red or green, maybe              |
| 24:21      | depending, could have some colours in there button on your desk that shows I muted or                   |
| 24:25      | I'm not muted.                                                                                         |
| 24:27      | And then when you tap it, it toggles it.                                                               |
| 24:29      | But if you work with Microsoft Teams and [[Slack]] and Zoom, and I don't know, maybe throwing              |
| 24:34      | some WebEx and maybe even Skype still in there.                                                        |
| 24:38      | Well, depending on which app you're in, you're going to need something different in each               |
| 24:41      | of those apps.                                                                                         |
| 24:43      | And that's where a macro pad, even just a one button macro pad, could come in super                    |
| 24:46      | handy.                                                                                                 |
| 24:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 24:48      | I mean, I was looking at drop.com, which is a great site that always has a variety of                  |
| 24:53      | macro pads.                                                                                            |
| 24:54      | And I always keep thinking, you know, maybe I should try one of these things.                          |
| 24:57      | But because I'm so invested in the Stream Deck ecosystem, do I really need it?                         |
| 25:00      | But like, they've got a cool one here I'm looking at right now.                                        |
| 25:04      | It's got two dials.                                                                                    |
| 25:05      | Like it's got a big dial, like a big dial and a little dial inside of it.                              |
| 25:09      | So you could like set volumes, you could set up for scrubbing and video or whatever.                   |
| 25:14      | And three little buttons on top of it.                                                                 |
| 25:16      | Well, I'm looking at that thinking, this would be perfect for editing screencast videos.               |
| 25:21      | Like you scrub back and forth, you'd mark your in and out point, and then you hit the                  |
| 25:25      | cut.                                                                                                   |
| 25:26      | And that's all you need is three, three buttons to do that.                                            |
| 25:28      | It's like, damn Rose, now I'm going to have to spend some money today.                                 |
| 25:33      | Well, I mean, those are pretty cool.                                                                   |
| 25:35      | I would also know if folks are intrigued by the idea of like a dial, then there is a                   |
| 25:40      | couple of other things, one that kind of falls technically into the mouse section or maybe             |
| 25:44      | other hardware.                                                                                        |
| 25:45      | And then there's a Stream Deck that we're going to talk about later.                                   |
| 25:48      | So you know, don't go by that just yet, but yeah, well, I mean, I'm going to talk you                  |
| 25:56      | on to a more expensive ledge later, David, let's let's be honest here, but that's how                  |
| 26:01      | the show works.                                                                                        |
| 26:03      | But you know, this is, you know, this is the brilliance of it, because if you think about              |
| 26:07      | it when, you know, when you're at your desk, you know, you have like the places that you               |
| 26:11      | put your fingers on, on your keyboard to type, okay?                                                   |
| 26:14      | So usually the recommendation is that you put your index finger on the left side on                    |
| 26:17      | the F and the index finger on the right on the J. That's why they've got those two little              |
| 26:20      | dashes on there to help you orient yourself.                                                           |
| 26:23      | But if you think about it, you know, that's not necessarily the most comfortable position              |
| 26:28      | for doing other things in, especially if you're, say, using one of those Wacom tablets or similar      |
| 26:34      | with Photoshop, you may actually want something that's not reach over this quite large Wacom           |
| 26:41      | tablet to press the button on the keyboard.                                                            |
| 26:43      | You may want just the keys that you need within easy reach.                                            |
| 26:47      | And that's where a macro pack can come in really handy for that.                                       |
| 26:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 26:51      | Well, there's a whole world of these macro pads and you can get them like, like Rose                   |
| 26:55      | said, you can get them with one button, but, you know, usually they're in the four to twelve           |
| 26:59      | button range and, you know, it's a separate USB-C connector usually.                                   |
| 27:05      | So you've got a separate cable connection and you can get custom key caps for them.                    |
| 27:09      | You can get them blank.                                                                                |
| 27:11      | Kind of imagine it as a Stream Deck without the lit buttons and their physical buttons                 |
| 27:17      | and they're super popular and there's lots of ways you can use these things.                           |
| 27:21      | So they're definitely worth checking out.                                                              |
| 27:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 27:25      | If you're somebody who's into the idea of building like your own hardware and so on                    |
| 27:28      | and you've kind of thought of, oh, like this, this seems like an interesting thing.                    |
| 27:32      | You know, it could be a really good DIY project as well.                                               |
| 27:35      | There's plenty of folks out there who are streaming and making videos on how to do this                |
| 27:39      | stuff by hand.                                                                                         |
| 27:41      | So you could definitely have a look into that if you're curious.                                       |
| 27:44      | The only thing I will call some folks about is if you are specifically looking to buy                  |
| 27:47      | a macro pad.                                                                                           |
| 27:48      | A lot of the places when you buy a macro pad, it's kind of like you're buying a LEGO castle.           |
| 27:54      | You're actually buying the LEGO to build the castle.                                                   |
| 27:57      | You're not buying the LEGO castle.                                                                     |
| 27:59      | So a lot of the times when you buy a macro pad, you will get like the components with                  |
| 28:03      | which you need to construct a macro pad.                                                               |
| 28:05      | Some soldering may be required or not, but definitely do your research before you just                 |
| 28:08      | jump in and buy something because otherwise you might be all excited, oh, yeah, my macro               |
| 28:12      | pad's arrived.                                                                                         |
| 28:13      | And then it's like, wait, wait, do I need to buy soldering right now?                                  |
| 28:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 28:17      | Like, oh, I'm going to have to go buy a soldering iron first type thing.                               |
| 28:20      | So yeah, a little piece of buyer beware there, but you can definitely have some fun.                        |
| 28:27      | And as I mentioned before, you could just pick up a number pad off of Amazon or somewhere              |
| 28:31      | and give that a try to start with and see if that does something because you've got                    |
| 28:37      | a cheap way to try something out and then you can get nerdy with the other options in                  |
| 28:43      | a bit.                                                                                                 |
| 28:44      | All right, let's talk about my sing track pads real quick.                                             |
| 28:48      | I guess there's there's additional control services game we're going to get there.                     |
| 28:52      | But let's just talk about what you already have on your desk.                                          |
| 28:54      | And if you're using an apple magic mouse, there's actually quite a bit you can do with                 |
| 28:59      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 29:00      | If you go to the mouse settings, they've got some additional settings where you can                    |
| 29:03      | do scrolling and swiping with that surface of the apple magic mouse.                                   |
| 29:08      | But this is another one where [[BetterTouchTool]] really comes to the rescue.                            |
| 29:13      | The [[BetterTouchTool]], the tool set for the apple magic mouse is I think that's the reason             |
| 29:19      | I think that's the original reason better touch will exist was either the mouse of the                 |
| 29:24      | track that I'm not sure which one came first, but there are so many gestures that they add             |
| 29:29      | like, you know, one finger tap to the left, you know, scroll up with a modifier key, you               |
| 29:36      | know, four finger gestures, three finger gestures, three finger double tap, you know, like you         |
| 29:42      | could put, I don't know, something like 50 different triggers onto a magic mouse if you                |
| 29:48      | wanted to using the, you know, using the [[BetterTouchTool]] tool set, which is really kind              |
| 29:56      | of amazing.                                                                                            |
| 29:57      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 29:59      | And, you know, you might be thinking, I don't really like, you know, the magic mouse, you              |
| 30:04      | know, it's it's given me personally quite bad hand cramp before when I've been using                   |
| 30:08      | it even just for a few hours.                                                                          |
| 30:10      | So, you know, I've I've moved to the magic trackpad, which you can go ahead and customise              |
| 30:14      | the same way.                                                                                          |
| 30:16      | Or if you've got another mouse, and it's got some other buttons on it, you can do the                  |
| 30:21      | exact same thing.                                                                                      |
| 30:22      | So I have a razor, I think it's the basilisk mouse, it's got some some extra buttons on                |
| 30:28      | there.                                                                                                 |
| 30:29      | And those are so useful for triggering things.                                                         |
| 30:30      | So I've got buttons on the side that move backwards and forwards between spaces.                       |
| 30:33      | And then there's another button at the front, which takes me back to my main space, which              |
| 30:39      | is great.                                                                                              |
| 30:41      | And then I've got other buttons underneath the scroll wheel, which I haven't yet programmed.           |
| 30:45      | I've been trying to figure out what the best thing to do with those is I was experimenting             |
| 30:48      | with home and end.                                                                                     |
| 30:51      | So like go to the top of the page, go to the bottom of the page.                                       |
| 30:54      | And I quite like that.                                                                                 |
| 30:56      | But there was something that didn't feel quite right about it to me.                                   |
| 30:59      | It didn't feel quite natural.                                                                          |
| 31:00      | So I may have to, you know, give that a try and do some more experimenting.                            |
| 31:05      | But if you've got buttons on your devices, then, you know, you should check it out.                    |
| 31:10      | If you've got a Logitech mouse, I should say that you should have the option of installing             |
| 31:16      | the Logitech option software.                                                                          |
| 31:19      | This is not my favourite software in the world.                                                         |
| 31:20      | But if you want to just get started with something that's, you know, very easy to just, you know,      |
| 31:25      | I can see the button, I click the picture of the button and then I select what it does.                |
| 31:31      | It's a very good way to get started with that stuff.                                                   |
| 31:33      | And then, of course, there's [[BetterTouchTool]] for, you know, the next level up, as you                |
| 31:39      | might say, with all of these things.                                                                   |
| 31:41      | So yeah, it's definitely something I like.                                                             |
| 31:45      | And of course, David, we can't possibly let this moment slide without mentioning the                   |
| 31:50      | fact that you can combine the keyboard and the mouse.                                                  |
| 31:54      | Because if you're holding a modifier key, for example, a hyper key, when you click something,          |
| 31:59      | what happens?                                                                                          |
| 32:00      | Well, maybe some magic happens, depends on what you've programmed, right?                              |
| 32:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:05      | And that can all be done with [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                       |
| 32:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 32:08      | I'm actually dual-wielding currently.                                                                  |
| 32:10      | I have the trackpad on the left and the mouse on the right.                                            |
| 32:14      | And so I really use the left trackpad as more of a control surface.                                    |
| 32:20      | Like, you know, I've got all the gestures down.                                                        |
| 32:22      | Like I do a lot of video edits because of, you know, my job.                                           |
| 32:25      | And, you know, zooming timelines, moving in the timeline.                                              |
| 32:29      | I've got a bunch of gestures in there programmed through [[BetterTouchTool]] and like I have             |
| 32:35      | custom ones for ScreenFlow, which is what I do, screen casting, a different one set                   |
| 32:39      | of gestures that I do in Final Cut.                                                                    |
| 32:41      | But I honestly sitting here probably couldn't tell you all the gestures I use because at               |
| 32:47      | this point my fingers just do it.                                                                      |
| 32:49      | It's almost like playing the piano.                                                                    |
| 32:51      | And I find it very handy and not a problem at all.                                                     |
| 32:55      | If you've got like a trackpad in a drawer and you're using a mouse or vice versa, I                    |
| 33:00      | would recommend giving it a try.                                                                       |
| 33:02      | And the trick would be to put the mouse on your dominant hand and the trackpad on your                 |
| 33:06      | non-dominant hand.                                                                                     |
| 33:09      | At least that's what I have found works best.                                                          |
| 33:11      | And then you find that you do a lot of gesture-based stuff on the trackpad to make a window look       |
| 33:16      | right or something.                                                                                    |
| 33:17      | And like, I was talking earlier about window management from the keyboard, but you can                 |
| 33:21      | also with [[BetterTouchTool]] enable like force pressing corners and do all sorts of weird               |
| 33:26      | magic on the trackpad to do window management, if that's your thing or you know, launch certain        |
| 33:32      | apps.                                                                                                  |
| 33:33      | It's really amazing.                                                                                   |
| 33:35      | And I feel like this is something that a lot of people have the ability to do right now.               |
| 33:39      | There are people listening to the show that have a mouse with extra buttons on it, they're             |
| 33:42      | not using.                                                                                             |
| 33:43      | Or there are people that have a trackpad on it that they're really not, you know, taking               |
| 33:46      | full advantage of.                                                                                     |
| 33:47      | And if you want to automate, this is such a great way to trigger your automations.                     |
| 33:54      | And once you get those down, they just become second nature.                                           |
| 33:59      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 34:00      | And that's the thing, isn't it?                                                                        |
| 34:01      | It's really about making this second nature and easy for you to use.                                   |
| 34:07      | You don't want this stuff to be difficult to use.                                                      |
| 34:10      | And so that's why, you know, I have two buttons on my mouse and I have programmed them.                |
| 34:15      | You know, they look like they might be sort of like, you know, forward, backward buttons               |
| 34:20      | and they could be forward, backward buttons if I were in a browser.                                    |
| 34:24      | But for me, the top one is most naturally moving towards my right and the bottom was                   |
| 34:29      | most naturally moving towards my left, which is why I programmed them for move a space                 |
| 34:32      | this way and move a space that way.                                                                    |
| 34:35      | But if the other way around works better for you, then that's what you should do.                      |
| 34:39      | And it is very, you know, good to be able to just sit down and have a play with this                   |
| 34:45      | and think, and once you've, you know, set up one thing, like give it a few clicks and                  |
| 34:50      | then walk away, go get a coffee or, you know, a beverage of your choice, take a walk, whatever         |
| 34:55      | it is, come back and then, you know, work with it and then see if, oh, ah, that feels                  |
| 35:00      | backwards or this doesn't feel quite right and have a tweak in a play because it's one                 |
| 35:06      | of these things where you will find over time that the way that you, you know, the way that            |
| 35:13      | these things work out is, you know, just that you have to adjust it as you go.                         |
| 35:20      | So, you know, you'll see what works best.                                                              |

| 35:59      | Every time I've needed to hire somebody, I wanted two things.                                          |
| 36:02      | I wanted both the skills necessary, but I've also wanted the right attitude.                           |
| 36:06      | I wanted that person to show up and be ready to work and enjoy working and to get those                |
| 36:12      | two things you need a really powerful system that can filter for you.                                  |
| 36:16      | And that's what LinkedIn Jobs does.                                                                    |
| 36:18      | It finds you the right people with the right skills and then you start talking to them                 |
| 36:22      | and you figure out who has the right attitude.                                                         |

| 36:44      | word that you're hiring.                                                                               |

| 37:28      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 37:30      | So we are moving on to dedicated control surfaces.                                                     |
| 37:35      | This is the expensive part.                                                                            |
| 37:36      | I'm pretty sure.                                                                                       |
| 37:37      | Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.                                                                            |
| 37:40      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 37:41      | Let me go first.                                                                                       |
| 37:42      | I, a couple of years ago, because I do video edits, there's a product that you can buy                 |
| 37:47      | by a company called Contour Design called the Shuttle Pro.                                             |
| 37:50      | And what it is, is it's a control surface for video edits.                                             |
| 37:55      | And it's got a big dial on the end with positive stops in it.                                          |
| 37:59      | So you can click it around and move your play head.                                                    |
| 38:02      | And then it's got a bunch of buttons ergonomically located around it that you can program for          |
| 38:06      | your in and out points or your edit points or your cuts.                                               |
| 38:10      | And there are a lot of people that are very successful in editing using something like                 |
| 38:16      | the Contour Shuttle Pro.                                                                               |
| 38:18      | I tried it for a few days and I just could not.                                                        |
| 38:21      | It just did not feel like something I would use.                                                       |
| 38:24      | I was good enough on a keyboard and trackpad that I felt like this big honking thing on                |
| 38:30      | my desk wasn't going to earn its living.                                                               |
| 38:33      | So I sent it back.                                                                                     |
| 38:34      | I didn't keep it.                                                                                      |
| 38:35      | But if you do a lot of edits or even like if you work in the Adobe suite, the Shuttle                  |
| 38:40      | Pro is something you want to check out and it's affordable.                                            |
| 38:44      | I mean, it's in the $100 price range.                                                                  |
| 38:47      | If you want to go crazy, there's another product that is similar and it's the Loop Deck products.      |
| 38:54      | And Loop Deck is a company.                                                                            |
| 38:56      | They're over in Europe.                                                                                |
| 38:57      | I forget exactly where they're located, but they make several different attached keyboard              |
| 39:03      | products that are control surfaces.                                                                    |
| 39:06      | The Loop Deck is the main one.                                                                         |
| 39:10      | That's their, I guess they call it the Loop Deck live now.                                             |
| 39:12      | It looks like they may have got a name change, but it's got six big dials on it, a bunch               |
| 39:17      | of buttons like the Stream Deck.                                                                       |
| 39:19      | It has some buttons that are lit behind by an LED screen, so they're programmable.                     |
| 39:25      | The dials on it are fantastic, positive stops.                                                         |
| 39:29      | The thing is machined aluminum.                                                                        |
| 39:31      | I spent a little time with one and it's not for me, because I don't make my living in                  |
| 39:38      | Final Cut, but if you do a lot of like heavy in video stuff, the Loop Deck is really impressive        |
| 39:46      | for that.                                                                                              |
| 39:47      | But it's not kind of like the jack of all trades that you get with a Stream Deck.                      |
| 39:52      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 39:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 39:54      | And I think that's one of these things where you have to kind of figure out what it is that            |
| 39:58      | you both want and what you actually need, because just because it's pretty and it's                    |
| 40:02      | shiny and it lights up and has pictures underneath the buttons is useless if you never ever reach      |
| 40:07      | out on your desk to touch the buttons.                                                                 |
| 40:10      | So for me, I've just been looking and I had a quick look.                                              |
| 40:14      | There's also multimedia controller Express from Contour.                                               |
| 40:17      | And that looks like it's about palm size-ish and that looks very interesting to me.                    |
| 40:22      | So I may be looking into one of those in the not too distant future.                                   |
| 40:27      | It seems very practical for a lot of the things that I need.                                           |
| 40:31      | But there are some other ones out there too that we should get to.                                     |
| 40:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 40:35      | But those are two companies that make good stuff.                                                      |
| 40:38      | The Contour design stuff is plastic, well-made plastic.                                                |
| 40:44      | The Loop Deck stuff is the build quality is better.                                                    |
| 40:47      | It almost feels like if Apple made something like this and it's priced appropriately, you              |
| 40:51      | know, they're more expensive, but they're very nice.                                                   |
| 40:55      | But it really requires that you need those types of controls and, you know, you know                   |
| 41:01      | who you are.                                                                                           |
| 41:02      | Right?                                                                                                 |
| 41:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 41:04      | Maybe gaming streamers, video editors, there's people out there that really can use these              |
| 41:09      | products a lot.                                                                                        |
| 41:10      | I just feel like for what I do day to day, it wouldn't earn its space on my desk.                      |
| 41:15      | And to me, like this space on my desk is kind of sacred, right?                                        |
| 41:17      | This is the stuff that I need to get my work done.                                                     |
| 41:20      | I don't want stuff on here that's not going to get used.                                               |
| 41:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 41:24      | And I think that is exactly it.                                                                        |
| 41:26      | And that's one of the reasons why I picked up, a little while ago, the Xencelabs Quick                |
| 41:30      | Keys.                                                                                                  |
| 41:31      | So Xence is spelt X-E-N-C-E, and it's all more with labs.                                              |
| 41:38      | But this is like, if you think of the iPhone, it's a bit narrower than the iPhone.                     |
| 41:45      | It has a dialed top.                                                                                   |
| 41:46      | It's got buttons going down the side.                                                                  |
| 41:48      | And then between those buttons, it's got a screen.                                                     |
| 41:50      | It's not a touch screen.                                                                               |
| 41:51      | It's just a screen.                                                                                    |
| 41:52      | And this is a programmable macro pad, but it's a step up from a macro pad in the sense                 |
| 41:58      | it's got a screen on it, so it'll tell you what those buttons do because you can change                |
| 42:02      | what those buttons do in different apps.                                                               |
| 42:06      | It's also got a dial so that you can actually use that as volume if you're studying music              |
| 42:11      | or zooming in photos or similar.                                                                       |
| 42:14      | And it's got a decent build quality.                                                                   |
| 42:16      | I really like it.                                                                                      |
| 42:17      | I found it's actually very useful, portable macro pad slash dedicated hardware controller.             |
| 42:25      | So this is the thing about being friends with Rosemary guys, occasionally she'll just send             |
| 42:29      | you a picture of something like one of these Xencelabs Quick Keys on her desk.                        |
| 42:35      | And then it's so tempting.                                                                             |
| 42:37      | In fact, you sent me the picture of this thing, and I'm like, do I need this?                          |
| 42:42      | And we never followed up on it.                                                                        |
| 42:44      | So tell me exactly what are you doing with it?                                                         |
| 42:47      | I mean, what apps do you use it in and where do you find it useful?                                    |
| 42:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 42:52      | So for me, like my Stream Deck lives kind of behind my keyboard and mouse on like the right            |
| 42:58      | dish side of my desk.                                                                                  |
| 42:59      | And it's not a stretch to reach it, but it is a little bit out of the way.                             |
| 43:04      | So I don't poke buttons accidentally.                                                                  |
| 43:06      | This is lying left of my keyboard, like almost immediately left of my keyboard.                        |
| 43:12      | And so I'm using this for all, like those keyboard shortcuts that you never remember                   |
| 43:20      | for various different things.                                                                          |
| 43:22      | And other things where, you know, some of this is actually just replicating what is                    |
| 43:26      | on my Stream Deck just because I want the button wherever it makes sense.                              |
| 43:29      | And sometimes I need to be doing something with my mouse, and then I can press the button.             |
| 43:34      | I often use this for like the keyboard shortcut that I need to press when I've got like this           |
| 43:39      | thing highlighted or selected or, you know, when I'm dragging something or similar, because            |
| 43:44      | that will then, you know, it's, you know, there's only eight buttons on this.                          |
| 43:49      | And eight buttons doesn't feel like a lot, but you can program this to have, you know,                 |
| 43:55      | like 40 programmable functions per application, because you've got 50, you've got five sets.           |
| 44:02      | Because so there's eight keys down the side and there's a button at the bottom where                   |
| 44:05      | you can switch through.                                                                                |
| 44:07      | And, you know, I've just been using it for all sorts of things, like I tend to keep the                |
| 44:13      | top two buttons for, like, I want to switch to this mode or that mode.                                 |
| 44:20      | So like my most common alternative modes while I'm, you know, doing whatever it is that I'm            |
| 44:25      | currently doing.                                                                                       |
| 44:27      | And then the other buttons are, you know, for things like open up these particular files               |
| 44:32      | that I maybe need on a regular basis at work or switch to [[Slack]].                                       |
| 44:38      | That's something that I'm always needing at work, like, oh, [[Slack\|Slack's]] beeped, like I don't               |
| 44:42      | need to, you know, command tab through six different applications that I've been in since              |
| 44:45      | the last time I was in [[Slack]], I don't need to find my mouse and move it to the dock and                |
| 44:49      | open it.                                                                                               |
| 44:50      | I don't need to command space and type SLA.                                                            |
| 44:52      | I just press a button and open [[Slack]].                                                                  |
| 44:55      | And so I have it set up for things like that.                                                          |
| 44:58      | And then, you know, I reserve the Stream Deck for things like yes, [[Slack]] is there, but it's            |
| 45:02      | also got a calendar next to it showing me, you know, like when I need to be doing the                  |
| 45:05      | next thing and so on.                                                                                  |
| 45:06      | Whereas this, it kind of just shows you text in between, which is a little sad, but also               |
| 45:11      | great.                                                                                                 |
| 45:12      | The thing that I do love about this is it's got that physical dial with like a mode button             |
| 45:15      | in between so you can switch modes, but it works wirelessly and wired.                                 |
| 45:21      | So if slash when it inevitably runs out of battery, I can plug it in and keep working                  |
| 45:25      | with it without having to, you know, you know, be like, okay, I guess I'll leave it to charge          |
| 45:31      | for a while and then, you know, you put it out the way and that's it, you've forgotten                 |
| 45:34      | how it works.                                                                                          |
| 45:35      | Now, does it require, I see they have a dongle, you have to buy the dongle in order to get             |
| 45:39      | the wireless function or is it?                                                                        |
| 45:42      | So I bought mine in a little bundle of Amazon that came with the dongle and a little case              |
| 45:48      | for it as well, which is really nice.                                                                  |
| 45:50      | So I can, you know, like take it places without worrying about damageing it.                            |
| 45:54      | And yeah, so I got a bundle.                                                                           |
| 45:57      | I don't know, I suspect based on the fact that their product page has the dongle separately,           |
| 46:02      | that the, the regular, like just buying that on their website wouldn't include it.                     |
| 46:09      | But yeah, check, check Amazon as well.                                                                 |
| 46:12      | I know that I got mine there and it came with the dongle for sure.                                     |
| 46:17      | And you can also, if you're interested in things like a trackpad, get it with a trackpad               |
| 46:20      | bundle.                                                                                                |
| 46:21      | The only thing that is a little bit of a negative about it, it's not a huge negative, is a little      |
| 46:26      | bit of a negative.                                                                                     |
| 46:27      | It's like you kind of need to use their software to set it up and use it.                              |
| 46:32      | But what I did for anything that I couldn't do in their software is I just had it like                 |
| 46:38      | send a keyboard shortcut for whatever and then, and then that was it.                                  |
| 46:43      | That was all I needed.                                                                                 |
| 46:44      | Then you can, yeah, once you get the keyboard shortcut in, then you can use all your automation        |
| 46:48      | prowess to send it off.                                                                                |
| 46:51      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 46:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 46:54      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 46:55      | I have to say, it's 90 pounds or I think it's $95 on the US website.                                   |
| 47:03      | So it's cheaper than things like the Stream Deck, it's $99.99 on the US website.                       |
| 47:08      | But it's a little cheaper on the Stream Deck.                                                          |
| 47:10      | It's smaller, it doesn't have as many buttons, but it's definitely worth considering if you're         |
| 47:14      | looking for an alternative to that just because it does have that screen built in.                     |
| 47:20      | And for me, my biggest problem 100% of the time is that I forget what macros and magic                 |
| 47:26      | I have set up for stuff.                                                                               |
| 47:28      | And if I don't have that little thing reminding me and saying like, hey, there's a thing               |
| 47:32      | for this, then I am not going to remember to use it.                                                   |
| 47:36      | And that's kind of like the saddest part of this.                                                      |
| 47:39      | So yeah, I make a point of trying to take advantage of everything by putting it in front               |
| 47:47      | of me in a way that I'll actually remember what it is and what it does.                                |
| 47:50      | Well, I'm tempted.                                                                                     |
| 47:51      | I'm going to have to look at this.                                                                     |
| 47:53      | Thanks for sharing.                                                                                    |
| 47:54      | This is the second time you've hit me with this one.                                                   |
| 47:57      | You got any other control surfaces that you'd like to share?                                           |
| 48:00      | Yeah, I do have one more.                                                                              |
| 48:03      | And you're going to really hate me for this one, David.                                                |
| 48:05      | I'm really sorry in advance, folks.                                                                    |
| 48:08      | This is the 3D Connections CAD mouse.                                                                  |
| 48:12      | And to be clear, I am not a 3D artist.                                                                 |
| 48:15      | This is not my day job.                                                                                |
| 48:18      | But the 3D Connections CAD mouse is a really nice piece of hardware.                                   |
| 48:22      | Obviously, it's designed for and works really well with things like 3D modeling.                       |
| 48:28      | But I found for me, it also works pretty nicely with, you know, like ScreenFlow and things            |
| 48:36      | like that because I can scroll backwards and forwards and you can like tilt it to left                 |
| 48:40      | or tilt it to the right.                                                                               |
| 48:41      | So it's the 3D Connections space mouse specifically.                                                   |
| 48:44      | And they do a wireless one that works with a dongle or a wired one that just plugs in.                 |
| 48:51      | And there's an even bigger one that's got a screen on.                                                 |
| 48:53      | I do not have that one.                                                                                |
| 48:54      | I've just got the, like, it's slightly up from the standard one, I guess.                              |
| 49:00      | Space mouse pro wireless.                                                                              |
| 49:01      | There we go.                                                                                           |
| 49:02      | Not the Space Mouse Enterprise.                                                                        |
| 49:04      | But this is just, I find this to be like the ultimate solution for me when I am, you                   |
| 49:11      | know, doing things like panning backwards and forwards because I can tilt left and right               |
| 49:16      | or I can scroll left and right.                                                                        |
| 49:19      | So like it would be like zooming out and in, but there's also pressing up and down, pressing           |
| 49:24      | forwards and backwards, tilting forwards and backwards.                                                |
| 49:27      | Those are actually different actions because you can, like, move the entire, it's like                 |
| 49:31      | a mini joystick basically in the middle.                                                               |
| 49:33      | And then you've got some useful keys on the side.                                                      |
| 49:35      | And so I'm really sorry, David, this one is probably, it's awesome.                                    |
| 49:41      | That's what it is.                                                                                     |
| 49:43      | I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry because it's great.                                                       |
| 49:47      | It's one of those things.                                                                              |
| 49:48      | It does not look like the most beautiful thing in the world, but it genuinely is great.                |
| 49:54      | And I have to say as well, if you are doing 3D modeling and you've been, like, playing                 |
| 49:59      | with it for a while and you're like, oh gosh, this is quite difficult to do.                           |
| 50:03      | If you spend a bit of time with the Space Mouse and you go through their tutorials in                  |
| 50:08      | the software and you figure it out and you set it up for your preferences, it's so good.               |
| 50:12      | It looks like it's on the Starship Enterprise.                                                         |
| 50:14      | Like it looks like something that captains chair.                                                      |
| 50:16      | It does.                                                                                               |
| 50:17      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 50:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 50:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 50:20      | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 50:21      | It's super cool.                                                                                       |
| 50:22      | And honestly, you know, I have found my 3D modeling, the bit that I do that's, you know,               |
| 50:27      | for fun is better since I've been using this.                                                          |
| 50:30      | So that's definitely a win.                                                                            |
| 50:32      | That's not why I bought it, but that is definitely a benefit.                                          |
| 50:35      | Wow.                                                                                                   |
| 50:36      | I mean, it says mouse on it, but does the whole thing move like a mouse or what?                       |
| 50:42      | No, no.                                                                                                |
| 50:43      | So it's just like the joystick part in the middle.                                                     |
| 50:45      | It's got a little blue glowy ring around it.                                                           |
| 50:48      | That's the bit that moves.                                                                             |
| 50:50      | And then, you know, it moves like it, like the whole thing kind of like pushes forward                 |
| 50:54      | and pulls backwards a bit.                                                                             |
| 50:56      | But then it also like tilts where you can just like, you press the top or you pull the bottom          |
| 51:00      | of it.                                                                                                 |
| 51:01      | And yeah, it's one of those things where it is a bit of a mind bender as far as like                    |
| 51:07      | spatial feeling goes because you do need to learn like the differences, but once you've                |
| 51:13      | got it, it's so good.                                                                                  |
| 51:14      | So good.                                                                                               |
| 51:15      | And then what apps are you using all these features in?                                                |
| 51:20      | So it really depends, but on my desk, I have my keyboard in the middle.                                |
| 51:24      | I have the Xencelabs Quick Keys immediately to the left of that.                                       |
| 51:27      | And I have this left again.                                                                            |
| 51:29      | And this is, you know, I actually use it sometimes for just scrolling up and down web pages because     |
| 51:33      | it means that I can be, you know, like, you know, often picking up a glass of water with               |
| 51:37      | my right hand because my right hand's tidier than my left hand.                                        |
| 51:41      | But you know, I'll use it for horizontal scrolling, panning and zooming in things.                     |
| 51:46      | And like it's also predominantly useful for, you know, you've got a big audio or video                 |
| 51:51      | track and you need to like move in and out on it and scroll around and stuff like that.                |
| 51:55      | So you know, that's predominantly what I've used it for, but it's great for that 3D modeling           |
| 52:00      | as well if you want to get that to go.                                                                 |
| 52:01      | Wow.                                                                                                   |
| 52:02      | And it's got enough extra buttons on it that you can trigger automations from it.                      |
| 52:06      | So yeah.                                                                                               |
| 52:07      | Oh yeah.                                                                                               |
| 52:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 52:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 52:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 52:11      | I didn't get around to the extra buttons.                                                              |
| 52:12      | It has like the command keys on there.                                                                 |
| 52:13      | It's got escape, shift, control and option.                                                            |
| 52:16      | It doesn't have a command key, isn't the word command because this is predominantly aimed              |
| 52:20      | at Windows and Linux users, but I'm not sure the software works on Linux, but either way,              |
| 52:25      | there's quick keys on the right, which are designed for like resetting your views or like              |
| 52:30      | toggling rotation on and off or something.                                                             |
| 52:33      | And then there's four buttons at the top, which are macro buttons.                                     |
| 52:36      | So yeah, you've got that, but those other buttons around the side are actually programmable.           |
| 52:41      | So and there's 15 in total, so 15 buttons and a crazy scrolling experience.                            |
| 52:46      | Or if you just want the crazy scrolling experience, you can buy that.                                  |
| 52:48      | Now would this also be a mouse replacement for you?                                                    |
| 52:51      | So you could just put it like under where your mouse normally is or this is.                           |
| 52:57      | I mean, you probably could.                                                                            |
| 52:59      | I'm not sure I would like that.                                                                        |
| 53:02      | It is a varied, you know, that you've got like, so the original mouse had like the track               |
| 53:07      | ball underneath.                                                                                       |
| 53:09      | And then there were the mice with the track ball on top, which some people got used to                 |
| 53:13      | and really loved and a lot of people really hate it.                                                   |
| 53:16      | It's kind of like that with the track ball on top, with an extra layer of obstacle course              |
| 53:21      | on top of it until you get used to it.                                                                 |
| 53:25      | And I feel like I use both of them in concert at times, like I'm working with them together.           |
| 53:31      | You know, like you're playing the piano, you use your left hand and your right hand.                   |
| 53:35      | I'm using the mouse and this.                                                                          |
| 53:36      | So I feel like just moving it over to the other side would just break my brain in a                    |
| 53:42      | lot of ways.                                                                                           |
| 53:43      | I could give it a try at some point, but I have a feeling like I'd have to reprogram                   |
| 53:47      | everything.                                                                                            |
| 53:48      | So I'm not sure that that would be a good experience for me.                                           |
| 53:53      | But you probably could, yeah, I just, I'm not sure I would do that, but hey, maybe somebody            |
| 54:01      | out there is using it like that.                                                                       |
| 54:04      | This is crazy.                                                                                         |
| 54:05      | If anybody's using it, because we're going to do a feedback show pretty soon.                          |
| 54:08      | I want to hear what people are doing with this mouse because I'm intrigued.                            |
| 54:12      | I have to admit.                                                                                       |
| 54:13      | Of course, something like this is going to attract me like a moth to a flame.                          |
| 54:17      | But I mean, and gang, if you're listening, when you get back to wherever you're going,                 |
| 54:23      | don't do it while you're driving, but you got to go look at a picture of this thing.                   |
| 54:26      | It's crazy.                                                                                            |
| 54:27      | Oh yeah.                                                                                               |
| 54:28      | It is.                                                                                                 |
| 54:29      | It is.                                                                                                 |
| 54:30      | It is like, it's like a wave made of black plastic within this like joystick-ish type                  |
| 54:36      | controlery thing, but it's just one bit.                                                               |
| 54:40      | There's no buttons on it rising up in the middle, but then as the wave kind of like ripples            |
| 54:44      | out around that, then there's buttons on either side, and then there's four buttons                    |
| 54:47      | at the back.                                                                                           |
| 54:48      | It looks very weird.                                                                                   |
| 54:50      | There is also just the space mouse, which is just like the joystick-y part.                            |
| 54:57      | I'm calling it the joystick-y part because I don't know how else to explain it in a way                |
| 55:01      | that will just kind of make sense to people in their head.                                             |
| 55:05      | When you go look at this thing, you will then be like, that looks nothing like a joystick.             |
| 55:09      | And I completely understand that, and I will accept your feedback to that point.                       |
| 55:13      | But also, like once you see like a video of somebody using this, you will also understand              |
| 55:17      | what I mean when I say it's like a joystick-y type thing.                                              |
| 55:20      | You could probably use this for playing Flight Simulator.                                              |
| 55:22      | I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but you probably could if you wanted to.                                |
| 55:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 55:27      | Well, go check it out.                                                                                 |
| 55:29      | And I'm not sure how much automation you could trigger with this thing, but it is one.                 |
| 55:33      | Oh, you got plenty of buttons.                                                                         |
| 55:35      | It's more a case of like for me, like I don't have to find an alternative way to automate,             |
| 55:40      | say like scrolling backwards and forwards in a video because I can just like slide to                  |
| 55:46      | one side.                                                                                              |
| 55:48      | And if I, so this is the difference.                                                                   |
| 55:49      | If I slide to one side, I move slowly backwards.                                                       |
| 55:53      | If I tilt to one side and move faster backwards.                                                       |
| 55:55      | And just, yeah, and so the, and these are not inexpensive, so you're looking at, to get                |
| 56:00      | the wireless one is $330 and U.S. and the wired one is 280.                                            |
| 56:06      | So this is, this is quite a mouse, but anyway, yeah, that's cool, Rose.                                |
| 56:11      | Thanks for sharing that.                                                                               |
| 56:12      | I didn't even know that existed.                                                                       |
| 56:14      | No.                                                                                                    |
| 56:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 56:16      | I actually found it through a friend who actually uses one of these at work, so an engineer.           |
| 56:23      | But yeah, the company was selling off some of theirs because they bought wireless ones                 |
| 56:28      | and then they realised that wireless ones are a mistake.                                               |
| 56:31      | So they were buying wired ones because wired ones tend to disappear from desks much less               |
| 56:36      | frequently than wireless ones, it turns out.                                                           |
| 56:39      | People have fewer problems charging wired ones because they don't need charging.                       |
| 56:42      | So I managed to get it discounted through a business sale there, which worked out quite                |
| 56:47      | nicely for me.                                                                                         |
| 56:48      | But yeah, they are pricey, but if you can pick up one second hand or borrow one from a friend          |
| 56:53      | or someone, something to try out, then it's an experience that is worth having.                        |
| 56:57      | I wouldn't necessarily say everybody should buy one of these, but it's definitely a fun                |
| 57:01      | experience.                                                                                            |

| 58:41      | All right, let's check in on Stream Decks.                                                                |
| 58:45      | We did a whole show on it, I think, about a year ago, and things have changed since                    |
| 58:51      | we were last talking about Stream Decks on the show.                                                      |
| 58:54      | First let's break down the new hardware.                                                               |
| 58:57      | In addition to the traditional Stream Decks, which is a panel of X number of buttons, they                |
| 59:04      | have released the Stream Decks pedal now, which is a USB-C cable-connected pedal that you                 |
| 59:11      | can put under your desk, and it's got three different pedals on it.                                    |
| 59:16      | You can program them just like any other Stream Decks button, but you can kick it with                    |
| 59:20      | your foot and you can mute.                                                                            |
| 59:23      | Because I use the Elgato WaveXLR for my audio, it's effectively my mute button now.                    |
| 59:28      | I just reach out with my foot and tap it, and the mic goes dead.                                       |
| 59:33      | You can use the pedal in all sorts of other ways.                                                      |
| 59:35      | If you've got things you frequently do in apps that you want, you can use the pedal                    |
| 59:40      | now.                                                                                                   |
| 59:42      | I find that primarily I use it when recording.                                                         |
| 59:45      | I also use it to kick off and stop recordings in ScreenFlow or any kind of recording I'm               |
| 59:52      | doing.                                                                                                 |
| 59:53      | I use pedal buttons for that.                                                                          |
| 59:54      | I also find it very useful in Zoom.                                                                    |
| 59:57      | You'll evolve it on Zoom calls, where suddenly the dog races through or whatever, and you              |
| 01:00:01   | want to turn the camera off.                                                                           |
| 01:00:02   | You can just do it with your foot, which is kind of nice.                                              |
| 01:00:06   | I find all sorts of uses for it like that.                                                             |
| 01:00:08   | I don't find myself using it in things like OmniFocus and [[Apple Mail]], but where I do like              |
| 01:00:15   | it, I use that.                                                                                        |
| 01:00:16   | That's a new piece of hardware.                                                                        |
| 01:00:17   | Roasted, what are you doing with your pedal at this point?                                             |
| 01:00:21   | As we record the show, I'm using the pedal to navigate back to the show notes.                         |
| 01:00:26   | That's what happens if I press the left pedal, if I press the middle pedal, it adds a timestamp        |
| 01:00:32   | so that we can let Jim, our wonderful editor, know that there's either a chapter marker                |
| 01:00:36   | we want to add or an edit point or something like that.                                                |
| 01:00:39   | And then the right one activates Safari.                                                               |
| 01:00:43   | So that's just me looking at whatever website it is or the sponsors and things like that               |
| 01:00:49   | as we're going through.                                                                                |
| 01:00:51   | So I have it set up for that, obviously.                                                               |
| 01:00:55   | I have different modes with this, so I don't always have it looking show note timestamps,              |
| 01:01:02   | which is to be clear, that just runs a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.                                         |
| 01:01:06   | Like for example, when I'm recording iOS today, I have it activate different scenes in Ecamm           |
| 01:01:10   | Live so I can pop up my iPhone or I can pop up my iPad or I can just switch back to just               |
| 01:01:15   | me.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:16   | And having this on a foot pedal is so useful.                                                          |
| 01:01:20   | You open a screen and you realise, shoot, my address is posted right there.                            |
| 01:01:26   | Or somebody else's address is just showing up on the screen.                                           |
| 01:01:29   | You can just hit a button and my foot defaults to the middle, which is natural with this.              |
| 01:01:36   | Because the right pedal and the left pedal are raised, so you can feel it.                             |
| 01:01:39   | I'm wearing very thick slippers right now to be clear.                                                 |
| 01:01:42   | Like they're proper sheepskin slippers and they're very fluffy ones, highly recommended.               |
| 01:01:48   | But I can naturally navigate to that middle button and move back.                                      |
| 01:01:55   | I do also use it in teams or [[Slack]] huddles at work.                                                    |
| 01:02:01   | I've been trying to figure out the best way of handling that just because neither of those             |
| 01:02:07   | apps are particularly scriptable.                                                                      |
| 01:02:10   | And yeah, so I've been messing around with trigger, particularly keyboard shortcuts and                |
| 01:02:15   | so on.                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:16   | But some of the keyboard shortcuts I want to trigger aren't actually keyboard shortcuts.               |
| 01:02:19   | And you can't add them to a keyboard shortcut and triggering them via menus, not possible.             |
| 01:02:24   | So I have to use [[Keyboard Maestro\|Keyboard Maestro's]], click an image and that doesn't necessarily work                   |
| 01:02:28   | if the window is too small.                                                                            |
| 01:02:29   | So I'm still figuring that out, but generally I'm reserving it for recording, but it does              |
| 01:02:35   | make my life a lot easier with that.                                                                   |
| 01:02:37   | So yeah, I'm really glad that I have it.                                                               |
| 01:02:41   | Even though I do use it, it gets intensively used a few hours a week, like maybe three.                |
| 01:02:47   | But it is worth it because it's just right there under my foot without taking up any                   |
| 01:02:52   | more space on my desk and without being in my way.                                                     |
| 01:02:55   | It's towards the back.                                                                                 |
| 01:02:56   | You know, I reach my foot forward for it rather than having it like under where my feet usually        |
| 01:03:00   | are.                                                                                                   |
| 01:03:01   | It's backwards a bit, which works perfectly.                                                           |
| 01:03:03   | Yeah, I really like it too.                                                                            |
| 01:03:05   | And you've got some inspiring uses.                                                                    |
| 01:03:07   | I need to be more aware of it and try and figure out more ways to use it.                              |
| 01:03:12   | But like I was thinking the other day, like I was going through just doing a review and                |
| 01:03:17   | OmniFocus, why not just hook a pedal trigger up to the review and say, okay, it's reviewed.            |
| 01:03:22   | Give it a kick and then it jumps to the next one.                                                      |
| 01:03:24   | And you know, the nice thing is with the automation we talk about on this show, whether it's shortcuts |
| 01:03:30   | or keyboard mice or whatever, you can have the pedal do multiple things and that's kind                |
| 01:03:36   | of awesome.                                                                                            |
| 01:03:37   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:38   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 01:03:39   | And then most recently, I got to release the Stream Deck Plus, which is a new piece                    |
| 01:03:43   | of kit.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:44   | It's got eight Stream Deck buttons on it, but they're larger than the normal size Stream               |
| 01:03:48   | Deck buttons, which is really nice if you're displaying like information on them.                      |
| 01:03:54   | And then it's got a touch panel that is the width of four buttons and below that it's                  |
| 01:04:02   | got four dials.                                                                                        |
| 01:04:04   | Now these dials are not the quality of the loop deck dials I was talking about earlier,                |
| 01:04:09   | but they do have positive stops and they work nice enough.                                             |
| 01:04:13   | And it's kind of an evolution, but the Stream Deck software supports it and there's a multiple         |
| 01:04:18   | functions you can put on it.                                                                           |
| 01:04:20   | Like the obvious ones are like volume and brightness, like if you have any of the Elgato               |
| 01:04:25   | lighting, you can control it with those dials.                                                         |
| 01:04:28   | But you can also have it trigger keyboard actions.                                                     |
| 01:04:31   | So like I have the keyboard shortcuts for moving right and left between spaces so I                    |
| 01:04:39   | can turn the dial and move between spaces.                                                             |
| 01:04:42   | When I'm in ScreenFlow, I have the dial program to scrub right and left.                              |
| 01:04:48   | In fact, I have two of them, one of them scrubs fast and one of them scrubs slow and                   |
| 01:04:51   | I can navigate my play head very quickly that way.                                                     |
| 01:04:56   | So it's an interesting piece of kit because it has new control surfaces and that touch                 |
| 01:05:02   | display only relates to whatever's on the dial.                                                        |
| 01:05:05   | You can't program them independently.                                                                  |
| 01:05:07   | That's one niggle I have with it.                                                                      |
| 01:05:09   | But it's an interesting thing and I've got it on my desk and I didn't send it back.                    |
| 01:05:14   | I immediately found use for it.                                                                        |
| 01:05:16   | Yeah, one of the things that I have found with the Stream Deck is the Elgato software                  |
| 01:05:23   | is okay.                                                                                               |
| 01:05:24   | Like it's fine, but it's not great and I wish it was better.                                           |
| 01:05:30   | But fortunately, that after we've been talking about all episode and I mean all episode better         |
| 01:05:35   | touch tool can program the Stream Deck and I am really pleased I was just poking around                |
| 01:05:40   | in there again because I go back in and check periodically, maybe not as often as I should             |
| 01:05:46   | on how [[BetterTouchTool]] is doing with the Stream Deck Plus.                                           |
| 01:05:49   | David, it supports everything except double press on the dials.                                        |
| 01:05:53   | Yeah, it is.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:54   | It supports the touch screen and everything.                                                           |
| 01:05:56   | So to start with when the Stream Deck Plus came out, the folks over at [[BetterTouchTool]],              |
| 01:06:01   | they added Stream Deck Plus and obviously you've got the eight buttons across the top.                 |
| 01:06:04   | They could do stuff with that right away.                                                              |
| 01:06:06   | They figured out the dials going forward and backwards pretty quickly and then they added              |
| 01:06:11   | the pressing of the dials and now they've added the touch screen.                                      |
| 01:06:14   | And oh my gosh, am I so excited for this because this has been what's kind of been holding me          |
| 01:06:17   | back a little bit from working with the Stream Deck or the Stream Deck Plus and with Better            |
| 01:06:26   | Touch Tool because I much prefer using [[BetterTouchTool]] to program my Stream Deck, but                |
| 01:06:30   | I also struggle with not being able to use the Plus with that.                                         |
| 01:06:35   | And there's two ways that you can use [[BetterTouchTool]] to be clear.                                   |
| 01:06:38   | You can either replace the Stream Deck software with it or you can just add buttons through            |
| 01:06:42   | the Stream Deck software and the replace mode is so much more powerful.                                |
| 01:06:46   | But yeah, it was just one of those things where I was having to wait a little while                    |
| 01:06:49   | for it and now it's here and I'm, yeah, I would say that's my weekend goal, but I'm                    |
| 01:06:54   | going away this weekend.                                                                               |
| 01:06:55   | So I'll have to be the rest of the week before this releases that I'll be playing with that.           |
| 01:07:01   | But yeah, I think we're going to have to come back and just do an episode on Better Touch              |
| 01:07:04   | Tool and everything it can do because this is so fun.                                                  |
| 01:07:07   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:08   | I mean, we're doing, I've got some people in the MacSparky Labs who have already converted             |
| 01:07:12   | fully to it and I'm going to do some interviews with them.                                             |
| 01:07:14   | I haven't done it myself yet because I think it literally is like a full day project to                |
| 01:07:20   | do this.                                                                                               |
| 01:07:21   | I have so many buttons programmed and the [[BetterTouchTool]], I'm sorry, the Stream Deck                |
| 01:07:26   | software is not terrible, but it's not great either, you know what I mean?                             |
| 01:07:31   | And the [[BetterTouchTool]] software is great and he, he's listed this as a beta feature                 |
| 01:07:37   | for a while.                                                                                           |
| 01:07:39   | So I've always kind of held back, but like you, I keep going in and looking at the tools               |
| 01:07:43   | he's added.                                                                                            |
| 01:07:44   | And basically anything you can do with [[BetterTouchTool]] now you can, you can custom program           |
| 01:07:48   | your Stream Deck to do, which is awesome.                                                              |
| 01:07:51   | One thing that worries me a little bit about it is the entire thing is reliant on some                 |
| 01:07:55   | open source software called Hammerspoon, which is another thing a lot of people use to custom          |
| 01:08:01   | program Stream Decks.                                                                                  |
| 01:08:03   | So he's reliant on that continuing to work in order for this to work.                                  |
| 01:08:08   | If it's open source, then the good news is, is somebody else, if it were to go away, somebody          |
| 01:08:12   | else is going to be able to pick that up and fork it and continue with it.                             |
| 01:08:16   | So you know, it's one of those things where it sounds scary, but often when, when it's                 |
| 01:08:21   | something like this and it's popular, it is much better than it being closed source.                   |
| 01:08:25   | You know, if Adobe decided tomorrow they weren't going to sell Photoshop anymore, that would           |
| 01:08:29   | be the end of it.                                                                                      |
| 01:08:30   | But something open source like Bunch, or sorry, not Bunch, Bunch is not open source,                   |
| 01:08:35   | documentation is, but something open source like Hammerspoon absolutely is [[Home Assistant]].             |
| 01:08:41   | That's a good example.                                                                                 |
| 01:08:42   | If the founders of [[Home Assistant]] said they weren't going to do anything tomorrow, which               |
| 01:08:45   | to be clear, as far as I'm aware, is very definitely not happening.                                    |
| 01:08:49   | They're super excited about that voice assistant, but you know, it's, it's all there.                  |
| 01:08:52   | All the code is there on the internet and you can take it and use it and provide attribution           |
| 01:08:57   | back to, to do whatever.                                                                               |
| 01:08:59   | So I think we're probably pretty safe on that.                                                         |
| 01:09:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:02   | No.                                                                                                    |
| 01:09:03   | And that's to finish the thought.                                                                      |
| 01:09:04   | I have decided, look, it's going to be fine.                                                           |
| 01:09:07   | And the Stream Deck software, I can always go back to it.                                              |
| 01:09:10   | So I'm going to archive obviously my and save backups of my current setup with it.                     |
| 01:09:16   | But I, I'm going to make the move to [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                |
| 01:09:19   | I totally believe in the software.                                                                     |
| 01:09:22   | The guy who makes it is awesome.                                                                       |
| 01:09:24   | By the way, you know, this is one of those developers who, who quit a day job just to                  |
| 01:09:29   | make one app.                                                                                          |
| 01:09:30   | And that's why [[BetterTouchTool]] has all these features that we love.                                  |
| 01:09:33   | So if you're interested, you should buy it or, or subscribe to it.                                     |
| 01:09:38   | If you have set up, you should absolutely download it.                                                 |
| 01:09:40   | That helps them out too, because we want to encourage this kind of stuff.                              |
| 01:09:44   | But it's been beta for a long time, but I think it's got to a point where I need to                    |
| 01:09:47   | just take a day and set it all up.                                                                     |
| 01:09:51   | And I think that's actually going to be a lot of fun for me.                                           |
| 01:09:54   | That's the kind of stuff I enjoy.                                                                      |
| 01:09:56   | But there, there are some crazy stuff you can do with this and Rose's right to really                  |
| 01:10:02   | do this.                                                                                               |
| 01:10:03   | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:04   | You need to let [[BetterTouchTool]] just take over your Stream Decks.                                    |
| 01:10:06   | And that's the other point I wanted to make.                                                           |
| 01:10:08   | I have, my Stream Decks have multiplied.                                                               |
| 01:10:11   | It's, it's crazy.                                                                                      |
| 01:10:12   | Last time we talked about it.                                                                          |
| 01:10:13   | Are you sure it's not the trouble of Stream Decks, David, instead of the trouble of triples?           |
| 01:10:17   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 01:10:18   | It feels like it.                                                                                      |
| 01:10:19   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:20   | It does.                                                                                               |
| 01:10:21   | It feels like there's just Stream Decks everywhere.                                                    |
| 01:10:22   | Well, the last time we recorded, I had a Stream Deck XL.                                               |
| 01:10:26   | And then in the max market labs, we were doing a meet up and one of the listeners was talking           |
| 01:10:30   | about, well, he's got two.                                                                             |
| 01:10:32   | And he uses one as a static Stream Deck where the buttons never change.                                |
| 01:10:37   | So like key lighting controls, key setups and things like that are always there.                       |
| 01:10:42   | And then he's got a second XL that, that is dynamic, you know, like, and I said, oh,                   |
| 01:10:50   | you know, that actually makes a lot of sense.                                                          |
| 01:10:52   | And then after we finished a call, one of the listeners wrote me and said, Hey, I have                 |
| 01:10:55   | an XL.                                                                                                 |
| 01:10:56   | It's just not for me.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:58   | I don't use it.                                                                                        |
| 01:10:59   | It's in a drawer.                                                                                      |
| 01:11:00   | I'll sell it to you.                                                                                   |
| 01:11:01   | So I'm like, okay.                                                                                     |
| 01:11:02   | So I bought it from him.                                                                               |
| 01:11:03   | And then off of, off Etsy, somebody 3D printed me a nice little rack where you can put them            |
| 01:11:10   | right on top of each other.                                                                            |
| 01:11:12   | I'll put a picture out with the show when it goes out.                                                 |
| 01:11:15   | But so I've got a static one on top, a dynamic one on bottom, and like it's really great.              |
| 01:11:19   | For instance, like I've got a button on the static one that says automators.                           |
| 01:11:22   | It's our show art.                                                                                     |
| 01:11:23   | And if I click that, the entire bottom 32 buttons remap themselves for stuff I do when                 |
| 01:11:29   | I'm making the automators, you know, you know, running the setup, recording the ads, doing             |
| 01:11:35   | the outline, all the stuff that I can, in fact, I'm not using them all because I don't                 |
| 01:11:39   | have 32 things I need to do related to the show.                                                       |
| 01:11:41   | But like I can tell you right now, it's 753 p.m. in London, you know, it's like, it gives              |
| 01:11:45   | me everything I need to, to make this show on a, on this dynamic bottom one.                           |
| 01:11:51   | And it's great.                                                                                        |
| 01:11:52   | Then of course I added the Stream Deck plus because it couldn't help myself, but I use                 |
| 01:11:56   | that largely for recording tools and action.                                                           |
| 01:12:00   | And then I've got the buttons below, you know, in the pedal.                                           |
| 01:12:03   | So I have four Stream Decks running.                                                                   |
| 01:12:05   | And that's one of the reasons why I'm a little intimidated by going a [[BetterTouchTool]] over           |
| 01:12:11   | because I've got to reconfigure four Stream Decks, not just one.                                       |
| 01:12:15   | And that's going to be work.                                                                           |
| 01:12:17   | And the one, the dynamic one has about 10 different setups on it, you know, 10 different               |
| 01:12:22   | screens, whether I'm, you know, an OmniFocus to managing mail, making Mac power users,                 |
| 01:12:27   | doing work on a new field guide, all those buttons keep remapping themselves as I go                   |
| 01:12:31   | throughout the day.                                                                                    |
| 01:12:32   | So I got a little project ahead of me, Rose.                                                           |
| 01:12:36   | You do.                                                                                                |
| 01:12:37   | I have to say what I did is I managed to go find the actual Stream Deck, like configuration.           |
| 01:12:42   | I backed up my Stream Decks and exported the backup files.                                             |
| 01:12:46   | And then I, you know, just opened up the files in [[BBEdit]].                                             |
| 01:12:51   | And they're XML files.                                                                                 |
| 01:12:53   | You don't need to be able to read like the code behind it.                                             |
| 01:12:58   | You can just like look at the words and then you'll see like something that's called omnifocus.        |
| 01:13:03   | And then, you know, and it does this thing and this thing and this thing.                              |
| 01:13:06   | And that was very useful.                                                                              |
| 01:13:08   | The other thing that I did, because once you switch [[BetterTouchTool]] to taking over the               |
| 01:13:13   | Stream Deck, you need to quit the Stream Deck software to be able to work with it.                     |
| 01:13:17   | So I did screenshots of all of the different screens so that I had all of them and that                |
| 01:13:24   | worked out really nicely as well.                                                                      |
| 01:13:26   | So it was worth it.                                                                                    |
| 01:13:27   | Like I've done it on my work machine.                                                                  |
| 01:13:28   | I'm still in the process of swapping it over on my personal machine because like you, I                |
| 01:13:32   | have a lot of buttons and it feels like every time I sit down to do it, I end up being pulled          |
| 01:13:36   | into six other things.                                                                                 |
| 01:13:38   | But you know, it's worth doing it.                                                                     |
| 01:13:41   | My work machine is a lot happier since I switched to using a [[BetterTouchTool]] instead                 |
| 01:13:46   | of the Stream Deck software.                                                                           |
| 01:13:47   | So I definitely recommend it.                                                                          |
| 01:13:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:13:50   | I'm going to.                                                                                          |
| 01:13:51   | And you know, I've had plenty of bugs with the Stream Deck software over the years.                    |
| 01:13:57   | Totally unrelated.                                                                                     |
| 01:13:58   | I spent more money with Elgato last week.                                                              |
| 01:14:02   | Did you get the email last week?                                                                       |
| 01:14:04   | I might have done.                                                                                     |
| 01:14:05   | They released a green screen and it's a self-contained green screen where it lays on the floor.        |
| 01:14:13   | You pull it up.                                                                                        |
| 01:14:14   | And you pop it up.                                                                                     |
| 01:14:15   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:16   | And it's under tension.                                                                                |
| 01:14:17   | So it's flat.                                                                                          |
| 01:14:18   | It doesn't have wrinkles in it.                                                                        |
| 01:14:19   | And it's 160 bucks.                                                                                    |
| 01:14:22   | I ordered it and I put it up and I'm shocked at how good it is.                                        |
| 01:14:26   | And I don't need a green screen often because I have a great studio, but sometimes I do.               |
| 01:14:31   | And the way I used to set it up would take me like a half hour and it was lousy and now                |
| 01:14:36   | it takes me five minutes and it looks great.                                                           |
| 01:14:38   | So Elgato, you guys, you know, two thumbs up from X Sparky.                                            |
| 01:14:43   | You just keep making great stuff.                                                                      |
| 01:14:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:46   | I have one of these.                                                                                   |
| 01:14:47   | It's not an Elgato one, but it's the same sort of thing where it's in like a tube with                 |
| 01:14:51   | a pole and then you pop it up and you kind of click to the top of the pole.                            |
| 01:14:55   | And I picked one of those up from Amazon during the pandemic and I have to say it's a really           |
| 01:14:58   | useful thing when I need it.                                                                           |
| 01:14:59   | I don't need it super often, but when I do, it's there.                                                |
| 01:15:03   | And yeah, it's great because it doesn't take up much space.                                            |
| 01:15:06   | It's, I mean, it's bigger than a Gulf umbrella.                                                        |
| 01:15:07   | It's not that much bigger than two Gulf umbrellas and a bit taller.                                    |
| 01:15:11   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:12   | So yeah, it's pretty good.                                                                             |
| 01:15:13   | You can just prop it up against the wall in the corner, but when I need it, I can have                 |
| 01:15:16   | it up and running in five minutes.                                                                     |
| 01:15:17   | Nice.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:18   | Exactly.                                                                                               |
| 01:15:19   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:20   | It's great.                                                                                            |
| 01:15:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:22   | Definitely recommend that sort of thing.                                                               |
| 01:15:23   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:15:24   | So there we go, gang.                                                                                  |
| 01:15:25   | I am going to put this whole thing about this CAD mouse out of my head for at least a day.             |
| 01:15:31   | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 01:15:32   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:33   | I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 01:15:34   | This is scary.                                                                                         |
| 01:15:35   | So here's betting, folks.                                                                              |
| 01:15:36   | By the time this episode releases, David will have felt either the Sensei loves quick                  |
| 01:15:38   | keys or the CAD mouse or possibly both will have to let you know.                                      |
| 01:15:44   | All right.                                                                                             |
| 01:15:45   | The Sensei keys.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:46   | The Sensei labs actually is more attractive to me because I feel like, oh, that I could                |
| 01:15:49   | see myself using that.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:50   | The thing that I really like about it is you can chuck it in your back with you and go                 |
| 01:15:53   | somewhere because it's so small and it's so light.                                                     |
| 01:15:57   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:15:58   | And that's where it, like it's, it's kind of the portable Stream Deck in the very truly                |
| 01:16:03   | portable sense.                                                                                        |
| 01:16:04   | So yeah.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:05   | I still don't exactly understand what you do with this CAD mouse.                                      |
| 01:16:09   | You know what I mean?                                                                                  |
| 01:16:10   | It's just like, so it's not really a mouse.                                                            |
| 01:16:13   | It's just a, it's just a control surface.                                                              |
| 01:16:15   | I guess.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:17   | It's a control surface.                                                                                |
| 01:16:18   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:19   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:20   | It's a control surface that has macro buttons built in.                                                |
| 01:16:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:22   | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:23   | Well, what about you?                                                                                  |
| 01:16:24   | Did I tempt you to buy anything today?                                                                 |
| 01:16:26   | I'm not sure.                                                                                          |
| 01:16:27   | I mean, mostly that I just need to sit down and spend some time moving everything over                 |
| 01:16:31   | into the [[BetterTouchTool]] app for my Stream Deck stuff, and then we can come back and                 |
| 01:16:35   | talk about that.                                                                                       |
| 01:16:37   | I am definitely intrigued with the, the contour design shuttle, the little one, not the pro,           |
| 01:16:46   | but or the controller express, sorry, but I'm not sure.                                                |
| 01:16:50   | I'll continue thinking about it and see, you know, see what happens.                                   |
| 01:16:53   | But I'm not sure what that would do for you that the CAD mouse doesn't do.                             |
| 01:16:56   | Well, the thing with the CAD mouse is it's quite big.                                                  |
| 01:16:59   | So if I need more space on my desk, then I have to put it away.                                        |
| 01:17:03   | And it is, you know, it's a big thing.                                                                 |
| 01:17:06   | So for me, this, and the other thing is, is this I would potentially use for volume,                   |
| 01:17:12   | like a permanent volume dial or similar.                                                               |
| 01:17:14   | Maybe I should just look for something that's a volume dial.                                           |
| 01:17:16   | And that's what I actually want because that's usually what I want actually to be fair.                |
| 01:17:20   | What about the Stream Deck plus button?                                                                |
| 01:17:22   | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:23   | I mean, I am using that as well.                                                                       |
| 01:17:25   | It's just one of those things where sometimes like having like, this is just like this thing           |
| 01:17:29   | and it does this would be great.                                                                       |
| 01:17:31   | Maybe what I actually want, I think what I want, David, is I need to hook up.                          |
| 01:17:36   | I've got, I bought an IKEA symphonist button, one of the old ones.                                     |
| 01:17:39   | There's just like a dial.                                                                              |
| 01:17:40   | And I need to hook that up so that when I use that, then it pauses or resumes playback                 |
| 01:17:45   | on my HomePods and then adjust the volume up and down here in the office.                             |
| 01:17:48   | That's what I need to do.                                                                              |
| 01:17:49   | Well, either way.                                                                                      |
| 01:17:50   | That's my project.                                                                                     |

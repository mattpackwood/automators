| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.               |
| 00:07      | And this is where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.              |
| 00:12      | Hello, Rosemary.                                                                                      |
| 00:13      | Hey, David.                                                                                           |
| 00:14      | How are you?                                                                                          |
| 00:15      | I am excellent.                                                                                       |
| 00:17      | I have been in the, what do you call it, the vision pro-verse?                                        |
| 00:23      | I've been in the matrix.                                                                              |
| 00:24      | What do you call it?                                                                                  |
| 00:25      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 00:26      | I mean, I don't know, it's sort of virtual reality, but with the really good posture                  |
| 00:31      | and stuff, it's not really virtual reality, it's augmented reality.                                   |
| 00:34      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 00:35      | All I can say is every time I see somebody wearing a vision pro headset, it kind of reminds           |
| 00:40      | me of Eve from Wally, and I re-watched Wally this weekend, and now, yeah, I'm very excited            |
| 00:47      | for vision pro, because, you know, it'd be really cool if you could get like, if you                  |
| 00:50      | could look at a map and it would just like draw on there exactly where you needed to                  |
| 00:53      | go.                                                                                                   |
| 00:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:55      | I've been calling mine Wally, because it looks kind of like Wally's eyes, you know?                   |
| 01:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01      | But at the same time, the screen is a bit more like Eve and the way her eyes work, so...              |
| 01:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:07      | Eve might work, too.                                                                                  |
| 01:08      | Yeah, you're right.                                                                                   |
| 01:09      | Well, Rose, my couch is sitting here waiting.                                                         |
| 01:11      | The Irvine Apple Store is six miles from my house, so when you can't take it anymore,                 |
| 01:17      | just come on over.                                                                                    |
| 01:18      | I'll take you out to Gumbo afterwards or something, you know, so you feel a little bit                |
| 01:23      | better about the cost between the flight and the unit.                                                |
| 01:28      | I actually think that, I heard in the max record labs, some people were having trouble                |
| 01:32      | actually going back with them that had flown over, like the customs was giving them a hard            |
| 01:37      | time.                                                                                                 |
| 01:38      | Well, I mean, I haven't heard of customs giving people a hard time, but like, it is a fairly          |
| 01:43      | high import cost that you have to pay, so, you know, obviously you're paying whatever                 |
| 01:47      | the price is for the vision pro in the US, and then there's sales tax and so on, on top               |
| 01:51      | of that for various things, which I can't remember if you can reclaim or not, because                 |
| 01:55      | I haven't actually seriously looked at flying over to buy a vision pro, but either way,               |
| 01:59      | so you have to pay all of that, and, you know, you pay for your flight, and then you fly              |
| 02:03      | back and you need to go through, there's, you know, the two different sort of exit queues.            |
| 02:09      | Once you've got your bags back, you know, I have nothing to declare or I have something               |
| 02:13      | to declare.                                                                                           |
| 02:14      | And you have to go through the one that says, I have something to declare and tell them what          |
| 02:17      | it is that you bought and how much it was, and, yeah, that's where it gets very extensive.            |
| 02:23      | So how?                                                                                               |
| 02:24      | Are you thinking about buying one when they do show up in the UK?                                     |
| 02:26      | I mean, I expect they probably will at some point.                                                    |
| 02:29      | Yeah, when they show up in the UK, definitely, it's one of those things.                              |
| 02:32      | When the iPad very first released over here, we didn't get it for quite some time.                    |
| 02:36      | In fact, I seem to remember that we only got the iPad first gen shortly before the iPad               |
| 02:41      | second gen released.                                                                                  |
| 02:43      | And then for reasons I do not fully understand historically thinking, I bought an iPad one            |
| 02:48      | instead of an iPad two.                                                                               |
| 02:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 02:50      | Don't ask me what I was thinking.                                                                     |
| 02:52      | Honestly, it was a great device and I really liked it.                                                |
| 02:56      | And I'm kind of glad that my first iPad was the original iPad.                                        |
| 02:59      | But at the same time, I should have bought the iPad two.                                              |
| 03:01      | So I feel like I'm going to hold off and see when it comes out over here because I've                 |
| 03:07      | been hearing so many great things about the Vision Pro and the experience on it and so                |
| 03:11      | on.                                                                                                   |
| 03:12      | But at the same time, just like the early iPad, even the early iPods and iPhones, there               |
| 03:18      | were big jumps between those first releases.                                                          |
| 03:22      | If we look at a more recent example of the Apple Watch, there was a huge jump between                 |
| 03:27      | the first gen Apple Watch and the later Apple Watches, especially when it came to the operating       |
| 03:31      | system on it.                                                                                         |
| 03:34      | And on top of that, we've got the M1 Max that came out.                                               |
| 03:37      | They made some pretty big jumps as well.                                                              |
| 03:40      | So I feel like it's worth me holding off because I can't get one so easily.                           |
| 03:44      | I'd have to take holiday from work and fly over by it.                                                |
| 03:48      | And also on top of that, getting lenses to replace my glasses, I'd have to probably get               |
| 03:54      | them posted to you and get you to post those afterwards and stuff.                                    |
| 03:58      | It's complicated.                                                                                     |
| 03:59      | So I feel like I'm better off waiting.                                                                |
| 04:02      | And this also means that I'm going to be going in completely blind, at least from a Vision            |
| 04:06      | Pro perspective, I've tried an Oculus Quest, I have an Oculus Quest actually, which I really          |
| 04:12      | enjoy the Quest 2.                                                                                    |
| 04:14      | It's great for playing things like Beat Saber and so on, but I'm going to be going into               |
| 04:18      | the Vision Pro experience blind, but I feel like if I go in straight into second gen,                 |
| 04:24      | that's going to be even more amazing.                                                                 |
| 04:25      | So I'm currently living vicariously.                                                                  |
| 04:29      | It can only get better from here.                                                                     |
| 04:32      | I actually think you're smart.                                                                        |
| 04:33      | And people in the US who are waiting for second generation are smart because this is a lot            |
| 04:38      | of money.                                                                                             |
| 04:39      | And if you want to buy it, like I bought one, I think it's great to kind of see the future            |
| 04:45      | now, but I do think it's going to get a lot better.                                                   |
| 04:49      | And there's clear points in this thing where they just haven't got to fixing basic things             |
| 04:55      | like the example I used in the labs the other day was, I shot a video for the labs.                   |
| 05:01      | Like I made a kind of here is video and me using stuff in it, and I finished shooting                 |
| 05:06      | it and you tap on and I say tap, you look at a box and you tap your thumb and forefinger              |
| 05:12      | together and it says, would you like to view it or delete it?                                         |
| 05:17      | And my eye just glanced down at the word delete.                                                      |
| 05:20      | At the moment I touched my finger and there's no confirmation dialog box.                             |
| 05:25      | It's like, okay, delete it.                                                                           |
| 05:27      | You're welcome.                                                                                       |
| 05:28      | It's like, well, I guess I'm doing that again.                                                        |
| 05:30      | And like those kinds of things will not be in version two, like they're, they're going                |
| 05:34      | to catch all that stuff from now that it's out in the public and or another one that                  |
| 05:39      | really stands out to me is undo.                                                                      |
| 05:42      | There's no universal undo, which when you do things, when you confirm things by looking               |
| 05:47      | at it and tapping your thumb and forefinger together, it's actually easy to make a mistake            |
| 05:51      | because your eyes wander and an undo button, like an universal gesture for undo, I think              |
| 05:57      | is necessary.                                                                                         |
| 05:58      | Either way, we are going to talk today about Vision Pro, at least we're part of the show.             |
| 06:02      | And the story I want to talk about is automation with this new technology.                            |
| 06:07      | I've been experimenting a bunch and I want to share it with the automators audience.                  |
| 06:12      | Also, but before we get started, we should say, you know, in the bonus section today                  |
| 06:17      | for automators max, we're actually, we're going to be talking about something entirely                |
| 06:21      | different.                                                                                            |
| 06:22      | Rose has been doing some file management experiments.                                                 |
| 06:25      | I'm doing some stuff too, with the idea that we'll do a show on this at some point.                   |
| 06:28      | And we want to like talk about the status of some things we're up to.                                 |
| 06:32      | So that will be in the ad free extended version of the show today.                                    |
| 06:35      | You can learn about that over at relay.ofm/automators.                                          |
| 06:40      | But let's get on with the Vision Pro.                                                                 |
| 06:43      | So David, how spectacular is shortcuts on Vision Pro?                                                 |
| 06:49      | I feel like that has to be the first question, right?                                                 |
| 06:52      | Well, the, its existence is, is spectacular that it's there.                                          |
| 06:58      | It is an iPad app.                                                                                    |
| 07:00      | It is not a separate native version of shortcuts for Vision Pro.                                      |
| 07:04      | It's just the, the iPad app.                                                                          |
| 07:06      | And that's one of the features of this device is in addition to running native apps, anybody          |
| 07:12      | who does not opt out and has an iPad app will show up.                                                |
| 07:15      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 07:16      | That, that makes a lot of sense.                                                                      |
| 07:17      | So do, do your main shortcuts that you use on a regular basis work on Vision Pro?                     |
| 07:23      | Or have you run into hurdles where, you know, things don't work for various reasons yet?              |
| 07:28      | Well, actually, I want to, before I get into that, I will say iPad apps on Vision Pro are             |
| 07:33      | a sub, sub par experience compared to native apps, which shouldn't surprise anybody.                  |
| 07:38      | But you know, the whole input mechanism of Vision Pro is that you look at something with              |
| 07:44      | your eye and you tap your thumb and forefinger together.                                              |
| 07:47      | There is no handles or controllers or track pad, although you can use a track pad.                    |
| 07:53      | And the iPad apps in general, I find the touch targets sometimes are a little too close together.     |
| 07:59      | And you know, the idea of like manipulating smaller buttons with your eyes is frustrating             |
| 08:06      | because sometimes you feel like you're looking at it, but you're not, or it's not looking             |
| 08:11      | enough.                                                                                               |
| 08:12      | And maybe if you just move your eyes just a little bit to the left, like move your area               |
| 08:16      | of focus is a little bit to the left, but then you're not even really sure if you lit                 |
| 08:20      | the button up because you're not looking at it, you know.                                             |
| 08:24      | And so on the iPad apps, you sometimes have those problems.                                           |
| 08:28      | And like the idea of grabbing and moving a block of shortcut with your eyes and thumb                 |
| 08:35      | and forefinger, that's, that, that's madness.                                                         |
| 08:38      | I mean, the way you usually click and drag is you look at something and you tap your                  |
| 08:42      | thumb and forefinger together, hold them and then you move it.                                        |
| 08:46      | And you can kind of do that, but it's really not precise enough, at least at this iteration.          |
| 08:52      | So I think maybe they should look at a vision pro native app or I guess really what they're           |
| 08:59      | saying is if you want to do shortcuts on a vision pro, you need to have a keyboard and                |
| 09:03      | track pad.                                                                                            |
| 09:04      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 09:05      | And for productivity work, I'll say I think that's a necessary accessory.                             |
| 09:11      | I bought off Amazon, a little plastic tray that you can connect a Apple Bluetooth keyboard            |
| 09:17      | and a track pad is as one unit, 12 South has a nicer one, but I haven't bought it.                    |
| 09:24      | It's a little bit more expensive.                                                                     |
| 09:25      | I thought I'd just use the Amazon one, at least to start.                                             |
| 09:28      | And I keep that in the drawer with my vision pro.                                                     |
| 09:30      | So when I sit on my, my comfy chair and strap in, I've got a keyboard and track pad in my             |
| 09:34      | lap and I found using shortcuts so long as I have a keyboard and track pad is quite pleasant.         |
| 09:42      | It's not a problem at all.                                                                            |
| 09:45      | That makes a lot of sense.                                                                            |
| 09:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 09:47      | And it's, it's interesting to me that you can use a track pad, but you can't use a mouse.             |
| 09:52      | You know, I'm not saying one is better than the other.                                                |
| 09:54      | They both have their advantages, but I find it intriguing that there's only, you know,                |
| 09:58      | the ability to add a track pad.                                                                       |
| 10:02      | And one of the things that I was wondering with this is on iPad, you can set up a series              |
| 10:07      | of gestures.                                                                                          |
| 10:08      | Like you can even use hot corners on iPadOS.                                                          |
| 10:11      | Yes, folks, seriously, hot corners are a thing in, in the mouse and track pad settings                |
| 10:16      | on iPadOS and they can even trigger shortcuts.                                                        |
| 10:18      | It's amazing.                                                                                         |
| 10:19      | But I was wondering what sort of things are there like that for visionOS, because I can               |
| 10:24      | imagine hot corners don't work so well because there are no corners in a sphere.                      |
| 10:30      | We don't need corners where we're going.                                                              |
| 10:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 10:34      | I mean, I imagine, I imagine if there was like hot doors where, you know, whenever you                |
| 10:37      | could see a door, if you clicked on it, then like a physical door in reality, if you clicked          |
| 10:41      | on it, then, then, then, you know, something would happen.                                            |
| 10:43      | That would be kind of cool.                                                                           |
| 10:45      | But you know, what, what is, you know, what is there to, to trigger shortcuts right now               |
| 10:51      | and other automation like things, you know, are there, it does it tie into focus modes.               |
| 10:57      | So when you are focusing on a particular thing, does that have the same sort of automation            |
| 11:02      | possibilities with, you know, the settings or not?                                                    |
| 11:07      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 11:08      | So focus modes exist, but they're in the control centre.                                              |
| 11:11      | They're kind of hard to trigger.                                                                      |
| 11:13      | We're going to do a live experiment later in the show with some of that to see what we                |
| 11:17      | can automate.                                                                                         |
| 11:18      | I can tell you the focus of my automation with it so far has been like, how can I set                 |
| 11:23      | up better and create things and the answer is not really, you know, because there is                  |
| 11:29      | no window arrangement scheme in the Vision Pro, like there's no automation for it right               |
| 11:35      | now.                                                                                                  |
| 11:36      | You can't say put this on the left side because there is no left side, you know, everything           |
| 11:40      | is just out there.                                                                                    |
| 11:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 11:42      | It feels like this is something that is going to get better right with time because, you              |
| 11:47      | know, they're, they're very clearly is a left and a right.                                            |
| 11:51      | That's the left and the right of where you're currently looking, but they're going to have            |
| 11:54      | to figure out, you know, what, what that means for, for all these things.                             |
| 11:59      | Because, you know, when you, when you open apps or if you use the split screen apps action            |
| 12:03      | on Mac OS, it very much works the same way that, you know, the iPad does where it kind                |
| 12:11      | of makes things full screen and so on.                                                                |
| 12:13      | And that's, you know, not really what you want on Mac OS.                                             |
| 12:15      | And so I'm not blaming the shortcuts team here to be clear.                                           |
| 12:18      | This is, you know, the difficulty with all of these things and, and, and figuring out                 |
| 12:22      | how do you translate something that works on iPad to something that works on a completely             |
| 12:26      | different operating system.                                                                           |
| 12:28      | But I think that there will be something, but I take it the open app action definitely                |
| 12:32      | exists, right?                                                                                        |
| 12:33      | So that you can open, you know, three or four apps that you would need and then you can               |
| 12:37      | arrange them manually, which isn't a great, you know, start, but it's, you know, at least             |
| 12:41      | you can have a group of apps that you want to use together and, and open them all.                    |
| 12:45      | Yeah, and anything specific to Mac, iPad, or iPhone just doesn't work because this is                 |
| 12:52      | a kind of a new, it's an entirely new piece of hardware.                                              |
| 12:56      | It's new operating system that just doesn't have equivalents.                                         |
| 13:00      | But like one of my favourite shortcuts, and I've got tons of these is like the project                 |
| 13:04      | creation shortcuts, like we're going to make a new episode of automators, then it creates             |
| 13:09      | a calendar event, it creates the note, it creates the task list and all that stuff works.             |
| 13:15      | The task list stuff didn't work when I used OmniFocus, but it does work with reminders.               |
| 13:20      | OmniFocus is on its way.                                                                              |
| 13:23      | They have not at this point enabled the iPad app because I think that any day now they're             |
| 13:28      | probably going to release a native version.                                                           |
| 13:31      | So I, the shortcut didn't have anywhere to go for that stuff.                                         |
| 13:34      | But if I modified it to use reminders or anything else that it could recognise.                       |
| 13:38      | So all the project creation stuff works good.                                                         |
| 13:41      | I really think that it's pretty useful for a lot of the shortcuts I do, but the setup                 |
| 13:48      | stuff, which I think this device needs shortcuts for, isn't there yet?                                |
| 13:53      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 13:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:55      | That makes sense.                                                                                     |
| 13:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:57      | And honestly, you know, going back to Omni Group and not having OmniFocus available on Vision          |
| 14:02      | Pro, I actually saw a really interesting post on Macedon from Greg Huckleberry talking                |
| 14:06      | about Tot, which is a text editor application that he has, and he made the iPad version               |
| 14:13      | available in the App Store.                                                                           |
| 14:15      | And one user, fortunately, was very, very careful with how they did things, but they                  |
| 14:20      | very nearly lost all of their data due to like a CloudKit syncing bug, which now he                   |
| 14:24      | has to buy a Vision Pro to figure out, because he has to do that.                                     |
| 14:30      | So I'm personally all in favor of the Omni Group going, we're not going to put OmniFocus on            |
| 14:35      | this without having tested it, because yeah, I don't want to lose my entire task management           |
| 14:41      | system due to something not quite working right somewhere, and then something getting                 |
| 14:47      | a little bit happy with the sync, and then just nuking everything everywhere else.                    |
| 14:51      | Omni Group are really helpful with their support and so on, so I'm sure they would be doing            |
| 14:55      | the absolute best to help folks who got hit by something like that.                                   |
| 15:00      | But at the same time, I prefer their approach of, let's actually get a Vision Pro in-house            |
| 15:06      | and test it and see what happens before we release all the things.                                    |
| 15:10      | So yeah, let's, fingers crossed, that will come through in the not too distant future                 |
| 15:14      | for us.                                                                                               |
| 15:15      | And the other thing is we record this show more than a week before it releases, so it's               |
| 15:19      | entirely possible when the show publishes, it's already out there.                                    |
| 15:23      | But the thing is, there's still a lot of work to be done on UI with this.                             |
| 15:30      | This whole system, like one of my gripes, in addition to the lack of an undo button,                  |
| 15:35      | is there should be some universal gesture control or something I can look at and wink                 |
| 15:40      | at or something just to kick off dictation, because dictation to me is such an integral               |
| 15:48      | part of this operating system, because voice control to me really, really works in this               |
| 15:56      | Vision OS.                                                                                            |
| 15:57      | But there's no way to start it.                                                                       |
| 15:59      | You have to go into a text field and then you have to have a microphone button show                   |
| 16:02      | up on a virtual keyboard and then press that.                                                         |
| 16:06      | It just seems to me very, you know, it just seems to me very fiddly and it should be a                |
| 16:10      | lot easier to just start talking and have it dictate your text.                                       |
| 16:15      | But there are apps coming on, we're going to talk about some of those in the future,                  |
| 16:19      | but it is an interesting new platform and automation is entirely shortcuts based at                   |
| 16:24      | this point.                                                                                           |
| 16:25      | And a lot of the shortcut stuff that you would think would work does work, like if you want           |
| 16:29      | to open a new notes document and populate it with some text, absolutely it will do that.              |
| 16:35      | But when you get to window management, then you get into trouble because there's just                 |
| 16:38      | no way to cover it.                                                                                   |
| 16:41      | One of the things I thought was interesting was that a lot of shortcuts I've made over                |
| 16:46      | the years, like when I want to watch a movie, I have a shortcut to set the lights just right          |
| 16:50      | in the room and you don't need to do that with this because everything is done in the                 |
| 16:55      | device.                                                                                               |
| 16:56      | If I want to watch a movie, it dims the lights through the device.                                    |
| 17:00      | So I can have the lights on in the room fully, terrible circumstances for watching a movie            |
| 17:06      | and yet I can still watch a movie in the dark.                                                        |
| 17:08      | It's just kind of a mind bender when you think about it.                                              |
| 17:11      | Yeah, that is pretty crazy and I think that this is one of the things that really is going            |
| 17:15      | to make this such a good productivity tool when we get there.                                         |
| 17:18      | You know, being able to select, I want this environment and I want these three apps and               |
| 17:22      | I would like, you know, this app to be kind of like off to my left, you know, where I                 |
| 17:27      | can move my head to see it, but I wouldn't like to see it in my peripheral vision.                    |
| 17:31      | And you know, I want these two apps in front of me and I want this music playing and so               |
| 17:35      | on.                                                                                                   |
| 17:36      | That is going to be an amazing productivity setup for people who just like to be able                 |
| 17:40      | to like dive in and be like, okay, I, you know, channeling your inner CGP gray, you                   |
| 17:45      | know, I want to be on a plane, you know, and I want, you know, this [[Obsidian]] open and that's          |
| 17:51      | and I won't play noise and just being able to create an environment like that, which                  |
| 17:55      | is an environment that you enjoy working in is, you know, pretty awesome.                             |
| 17:59      | Yeah, I did a blog post on my, my writing cabin, you know, that I've been talking about               |
| 18:05      | and the idea is it's in Yosemite, I've got, I'm using notes currently, although [[Simon StÃ¸vring\|Simon]]                 |
| 18:13      | has a text editor that I've been experimenting with, but you know, so I've got a writing              |
| 18:18      | app.                                                                                                  |
| 18:19      | I've got the environment of Yosemite and sometimes I may have Safari open for research, but in        |
| 18:25      | general it's an isolated writing environment.                                                         |
| 18:28      | And I've been using that on, you know, Vision Pro.                                                    |
| 18:31      | So like when I, I just make a list of things that need to get written and then I just sit             |
| 18:35      | in the chair, put the keyboard in my lap and I go to Yosemite and it like is already starting         |
| 18:40      | where my brain is like just triggers writing mode, okay, you're at Yosemite, just like                |
| 18:45      | people who go to the coffee shop to answer email or whatever.                                         |
| 18:48      | And it really works and the ability to create it artificially in the chair next to my desk            |
| 18:53      | is pretty amazing.                                                                                    |
| 18:55      | But just think about a future where rather than me have to dial in the environment, select            |
| 19:00      | the proper environment, get the app, put the app in the centre, you know, all of the steps            |
| 19:04      | that you take to set it up and granted it's not super difficult, but just think of you                |
| 19:09      | could just push a button and have that happen for you.                                                |
| 19:12      | I think that is exactly the kind of automation I'd like to see develop on this platform.              |
| 19:18      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 19:19      | And I think that this is one of those things as well where this, you know, this is, you               |
| 19:23      | know, it's not officially being sold as a developer hardware kit, but it kind of is a developer       |
| 19:30      | hardware kit and very early adopter kit because, you know, the people like you and, you know,         |
| 19:36      | people like me who don't necessarily have one yet are the people who are going to come                |
| 19:39      | up with, you know, these are the combinations of things that I would like to be able to,              |
| 19:44      | you know, have happen with a very quick click.                                                        |
| 19:48      | And you know, thanks to things like that, Finn Voorhees, son of John Voorhees at Mac                  |
| 19:53      | Stories, you know, created like a little sort of widget app where you can just stick a shortcut       |
| 19:58      | anywhere you want.                                                                                    |
| 19:59      | And so you can then look at it and tap and, you know, you tap your index finger and your              |
| 20:04      | thumb together and then you run, you know, a shortcut, which is something that, you know,             |
| 20:08      | didn't exist natively in visionOS, but things like that, you know, I'm not hoping that Finn           |
| 20:12      | gets Sherlocked at all, but at the same time, I feel like that's the sort of thing that               |
| 20:17      | should end up being built into the operating system.                                                  |
| 20:20      | And you know, fingers crossed, Finn will find ways to enhance his application so that it              |
| 20:25      | can continue being available to everybody.                                                            |
| 20:28      | But you know, we're going to find out about these things because people are experimenting             |
| 20:32      | with it and it's not going to be exactly the same as what the folks at Apple necessarily              |
| 20:40      | imagined, which, you know, I think is quite exciting because, you know, it's only when                |
| 20:44      | people actually get their hands on stuff that it really, you know, starts evolving and working        |
| 20:50      | or not working, however, you know, people might want to expect.                                       |
| 20:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 20:55      | I mean, as we record this, we're just a little over a week of this thing being in the wild.           |
| 20:59      | But Finn's app is a good example, you put a shortcut button on the lights, you don't                  |
| 21:04      | put them on the light switch, you literally put them on the lights and you just look up               |
| 21:08      | the lights and you tap it and then it turns the lights on and it's like that kind of stuff            |
| 21:13      | is cool and but it's just the first week.                                                             |
| 21:16      | It's like, you know, you go back to the phone days and when the phone first came out like             |
| 21:20      | a very popular app was the beer app, you know, where you had the glass of beer and if you             |
| 21:25      | turn the phone on that side, it looks like it was emptying the beer if you held it to                 |
| 21:28      | your mouth.                                                                                           |
| 21:29      | I mean, we're at the beer app stage of the GenOS.                                                     |
| 21:33      | I mean, people are going to come up with some really good automation ideas for this, I think,         |
| 21:37      | as it gets out there.                                                                                 |
| 21:39      | One app I wanted to know, it's not entirely automation, but I find it very useful is IECO             |
| 21:46      | A-I-K-O.                                                                                              |
| 21:49      | It's [[artificial intelligence]], it's using the whisper sync engine and it downloads the                 |
| 21:54      | whole thing to the device, I actually wrote the developer because I said before I talk                |
| 21:57      | about this on a podcast, are you collecting data or are you monetising, you know, what's              |
| 22:04      | your privacy policy?                                                                                  |
| 22:06      | He wrote me back, very nice guy, he said, no, everything, the engine is downloaded to                 |
| 22:10      | your device.                                                                                          |
| 22:11      | So it's going to use a bit of your memory, but it's an AI speech-to-text engine and this              |
| 22:17      | is perfect for visionists.                                                                            |
| 22:18      | You just start talking and it uses an artificial engine to go through and correct it and put          |
| 22:24      | in paragraph breaks and punctuation and it does a really good job.                                    |
| 22:29      | So you can just go in there and start talking and then you've got a bunch of text you can             |
| 22:33      | use.                                                                                                  |
| 22:34      | I think that's kind of a form of automation, at least.                                                |
| 22:37      | Yeah, I definitely say it is and things like this are, you know, it's such a different                |
| 22:43      | kind of tool to what you would need, you know, you might need this or want this on your Apple         |
| 22:49      | Watch, but you're not going to read this back on your Apple Watch, are you?                           |
| 22:52      | If you have something, you know, like record it and transcribe it, this is what sort of               |
| 22:56      | just press record or similar is for, because it records it and then you can transcribe                |
| 22:59      | it and look at it on your phone later, whereas on Vision Pro, you are really going to want            |
| 23:04      | to be able to transcribe audio, potentially even not just your own audio, but audio from              |
| 23:10      | other people speaking around you and see it, you know, so that you can transcribe it.                 |
| 23:16      | And I feel like just the concept of Vision Pro, you know, I've heard lots of people                   |
| 23:20      | talk about it, and I feel like until I've actually tried it, I'm still not going to                   |
| 23:25      | be able to really put it into words and even them, maybe not, but I feel like because,                |
| 23:31      | you know, virtual reality and augmented reality are such a fundamentally different way of             |
| 23:36      | interacting with our devices, the way that we then want to automate these devices and                 |
| 23:41      | therefore also the way that we want to interact with them is going to be very alien to, you           |
| 23:47      | know, how we do things on macOS and iOS and iPadOS, you know, you have, you know, a keyboard          |
| 23:55      | connected to your Vision Pro, so I take it you still have, you have spotlight and so                  |
| 23:59      | on available to you, but you don't have the ability to like hide an app, I think it was               |
| 24:05      | I was hearing, like Command H doesn't work, no, Command Tab, that's it, Command Tab doesn't           |
| 24:10      | exist right now, so you can't switch between applications because you switch between applications     |
| 24:14      | by looking at them, so of course, you know, you just look from, you know, I'm looking                 |
| 24:18      | at my actual monitor right now and I can see, you know, the zoom call, and if I wanted to             |
| 24:22      | activate that, I'd just look at that and then do whatever it is I wanted, but obviously               |
| 24:26      | on my Mac, I have to either click on it or use my keyboard to Command Tab to switch to                |
| 24:31      | it, which actually oddly enough activates the wrong zoom window, that's very weird,                   |
| 24:35      | but you know, there's there's all of these different ways of interacting with things                  |
| 24:39      | which is just so interesting and I'm so excited by the automation possibilities that this             |
| 24:44      | is going to bring to us.                                                                              |

| 26:29      | All right, Rose, so I know you have some questions for me about Automation Vision Pro.                |
| 26:35      | Hit me.                                                                                               |
| 26:36      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 26:37      | So let's start with the simple things.                                                                |
| 26:40      | Focus modes.                                                                                          |
| 26:41      | Are there focus mode filters available on Vision Pro and if so, what are they?                        |
| 26:46      | No.                                                                                                   |
| 26:48      | So focus modes, you are in the settings, which you can trigger manually.                              |
| 26:53      | You can use shortcuts to trigger them, which is great.                                                |
| 26:57      | You can also use them as automation triggers, but there is no filters.                                |
| 27:02      | It's just the usual, like, what people and apps are you going to let in options for the               |
| 27:08      | focus modes?                                                                                          |
| 27:09      | You don't get the same filters you get on iPhone and iPad or Mac.                                     |
| 27:12      | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 27:13      | Well, that's interesting.                                                                             |
| 27:14      | I feel like this is something that will come at some point, because focus mode filters                |
| 27:21      | came later.                                                                                           |
| 27:22      | They didn't come in the first version of focus modes on iPhone and iPad.                              |
| 27:26      | So that's something that's going to come, but you said magic words there.                             |
| 27:32      | Automations.                                                                                          |
| 27:33      | Are you telling me that Shortcuts on Vision Pro has the Automations tab?                              |
| 27:37      | Sort of, because it doesn't have location aware automation triggers, but it does have                 |
| 27:43      | the...                                                                                                |
| 27:44      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 27:45      | If you look in the sidebar, it says Automations, you can go in there, you can access.                 |
| 27:49      | I mean, the ones that showed up for me were largely my [[HomeKit]] automations.                           |
| 27:52      | Oh, well, that's the existing ones, right?                                                            |
| 27:54      | Because you hadn't created any new ones.                                                              |
| 27:57      | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 27:58      | Because I hadn't created any device specific ones, but there is a plus button there.                  |
| 28:02      | And if you hit it, you get the automation triggers that make sense on a Vision Pro,                   |
| 28:08      | which is...                                                                                           |
| 28:09      | Right.                                                                                                |
| 28:10      | And in fact, you and I, we did a little...                                                            |
| 28:12      | We're cheating a little bit.                                                                          |
| 28:13      | We shared...                                                                                          |
| 28:14      | I shared with you a screenshot when we were talking about it.                                         |
| 28:16      | So you've got the time stuff.                                                                         |
| 28:20      | You've got...                                                                                         |
| 28:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:22      | Your alarm.                                                                                           |
| 28:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 28:24      | Your alarm is related to your focus modes, like when you turn on or off a focus mode.                 |
| 28:29      | What were the others?                                                                                 |
| 28:30      | So you've got email and message, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.                                                 |
| 28:33      | And you've got Airplane mode, but you don't have app triggers, which is kind of interesting,          |
| 28:38      | because app triggers are available on iPhone and iPad.                                                |
| 28:41      | So when this app opens or is activated, run the shortcut, that's not available on Vision              |
| 28:46      | Pro, I guess, because you could be very easily activating a lot of apps in very quick succession      |
| 28:53      | by accident.                                                                                          |
| 28:54      | You sort of glance at one, and then you glance at the next one, and it's in the middle of             |
| 28:57      | running your Safari shortcut, and then you activate shortcuts and so on and so forth.                 |
| 29:04      | So yeah, that makes sense.                                                                            |
| 29:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 29:07      | And I think you said you've got the sound recognition option as well, which is from the accessibility |
| 29:12      | settings.                                                                                             |
| 29:13      | So that's kind of cool.                                                                               |
| 29:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 29:16      | I mean, I'm intrigued to see what becomes possible, because we know that the Automations              |
| 29:20      | tab on the iPhone and the iPad is not the only way to run shortcuts.                                  |
| 29:24      | The accessibility settings like double and triple tap on the back of your device on your              |
| 29:28      | iPhone and hot corners on iPad can also trigger shortcuts.                                            |
| 29:33      | So I guess at some point, somebody will go and do a deep dive and figure out all of those             |
| 29:38      | options on Vision Pro as well.                                                                        |
| 29:41      | I think what we're going to get, I think what they shipped was what they could ship, right?           |
| 29:45      | And...                                                                                                |
| 29:46      | Yes, absolutely.                                                                                      |
| 29:47      | So this iPad shortcuts, it largely works.                                                             |
| 29:52      | They disabled parts that don't make sense, like location awareness and things like that,              |
| 29:56      | because this device really isn't location aware.                                                      |
| 29:59      | You've got to have it connected to Wi-Fi.                                                             |
| 30:02      | Like whereas an iPhone is something that makes more sense for that.                                   |
| 30:05      | If I had to bet a nickel, I'd say in June when they announced the next iOS version or                 |
| 30:10      | the next visionOS version, that shortcuts is going to probably have its own app and                   |
| 30:16      | hopefully have visionOS specific actions, because like I was saying earlier, why can't                |
| 30:21      | we trigger an environment via shortcut?                                                               |
| 30:24      | And there's just a whole bunch of stuff.                                                              |
| 30:27      | Some form of window management or just centre it in front of me or whatever.                          |
| 30:32      | Or adjust the sizing to a particular size as well.                                                    |
| 30:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 30:37      | I just feel like there's work to be done there and it's not done yet, but the basics of it,           |
| 30:43      | you know, the things I want, some of the stuff I want at least now is there.                          |
| 30:47      | Like I'll be in visionOS and decide I want to trigger a shortcut to create a blog post                |
| 30:53      | on this thing I'm reading and it will give me a link to the source material.                          |
| 30:58      | It'll create the Apple node.                                                                          |
| 31:00      | It'll create the task list and the calendar items and all the various bits and pieces                 |
| 31:05      | I do with a project creation shortcut and those work fine.                                            |
| 31:10      | Triggering focus modes works.                                                                         |
| 31:11      | So like the way that you trigger focus modes in visionOS is tedious.                                  |
| 31:16      | You've got to go to the settings app and then scroll down to focus and then go find                   |
| 31:20      | the one you want.                                                                                     |
| 31:21      | It's very manual, whereas a shortcut, you know, I can just press a shortcut or trigger                |
| 31:25      | a shortcut and it'll do it for me and all that stuff works.                                           |
| 31:29      | So I'm thankful for what we have, but I also wish there was a lot more, although because              |
| 31:35      | this is a generation one device, I'm not surprised that it doesn't have everything yet.               |
| 31:40      | Yeah, and also, you know, with all of these things, we're going to see, you know, changes             |
| 31:45      | over time originally, you know, on iPad and iPhone.                                                   |
| 31:50      | We couldn't automatically run shortcuts when you connected to a specific Wi-Fi or Bluetooth,          |
| 31:57      | you know, connection or, you know, and we couldn't automatically run shortcuts, you                   |
| 32:02      | know, when messages arrived or emails arrived and so on.                                              |
| 32:05      | We had to manually tap to run and it's only after a lot of feedback that Apple eventually             |
| 32:09      | conceded that, okay, if people really want to be able to do this, like really, really                 |
| 32:14      | want to be able to do this, then sure, go ahead, let them do it.                                      |
| 32:18      | And I feel like this is something that we are going to see evolve over time with Vision               |
| 32:21      | OS as well.                                                                                           |
| 32:23      | So, you know, we're just going to have to see what happens there, but at the same time,               |
| 32:27      | I don't think, you know, the fact that we can't do this just yet, I don't think that                  |
| 32:30      | that's going to be a huge problem and fingers crossed, you know, we'll see some changes.              |
| 32:35      | You know, Vision OS 1.0.3 has come out with the ability to reset your passcode if you                 |
| 32:40      | forget it.                                                                                            |
| 32:41      | That's out already.                                                                                   |
| 32:43      | And Vision OS 1.1 is in beta, it's in developer beta to be clear, I don't think there's a             |
| 32:48      | public beta of it and it's kind of like the Apple Watch, I'm not sure, you know, how willing          |
| 32:53      | people should be to just throw a beta on their Vision Pro, because I don't know how easy              |
| 32:58      | that thing is to restore if it goes wrong, but yeah, you know, I think we're going to                 |
| 33:03      | see a lot of changes in a very short period of time, which is one of the reasons why I'm              |
| 33:07      | holding back on this, because, you know, I want, when I get there, to not have exactly                |
| 33:14      | the same experiences I first had on the iPad of, oh, this would be really cool if XYZ existed.        |
| 33:21      | And I think with the Vision Pro, it'll be a little bit more jarring because it'll be                  |
| 33:25      | like, oh, but this does exist on the iPad, but it doesn't exist on Vision Pro right now.              |
| 33:31      | So I'm hoping, fingers crossed, that, you know, all of those folks like me who haven't                |
| 33:35      | got a Vision Pro yet are going to get a really great experience when they first get to try            |
| 33:39      | it.                                                                                                   |
| 33:40      | But as it is, you know, it sounds pretty awesome already.                                             |
| 33:42      | Well, I'll say that I am usually fearless about betas and I am not interested in putting              |
| 33:48      | the beta on this one, because I am, it's just not clear.                                              |
| 33:52      | I don't want to be the first one down that coal mine, you know, what I would say also,                |
| 33:58      | I want to talk just a minute about, like, what would be my wish list for shortcuts?                   |
| 34:05      | Because, and I've got a list here.                                                                    |
| 34:08      | The first thing is, I think it needs a native app, you know, I get that it's launching with           |
| 34:13      | the iPad app, but the Vision OS is a superior experience with the native apps.                        |
| 34:18      | And I don't see why you couldn't make a shortcuts native application.                                 |
| 34:23      | And it would be slightly bigger touch targets.                                                        |
| 34:25      | And just thinking it through, I don't think it necessarily needs to be a knocked down                 |
| 34:31      | version of shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 34:32      | I think that you could have all the actions, you should be able to build them and move                |
| 34:36      | them kind of with a wink and the nod to the fact that it's a lot easier with a keyboard               |
| 34:42      | and attached trackpad.                                                                                |
| 34:44      | But I think they should at least aim for a version of it where you can make rough edits               |
| 34:48      | and do things with just your eyes and your fingers.                                                   |
| 34:52      | But I hope they do that.                                                                              |
| 34:54      | And I think that that needs to exist.                                                                 |
| 34:56      | I don't want this shortcuts app to be relegated to an iPad app on Vision OS forever.                  |
| 35:03      | And honestly, I'd like to see that sooner rather than later because I feel like you've                |
| 35:06      | got to start somewhere.                                                                               |
| 35:08      | The other thing I would like to see them do with Vision OS and shortcuts is really dig                |
| 35:15      | deep on all of these new features and ideas that this does where we should be able to                 |
| 35:20      | automate it here.                                                                                     |
| 35:21      | Like why not have, you know, actions for environments, actions for app and window locations.          |
| 35:30      | I also think that there is some opportunity here to solve some of the current problems,               |
| 35:35      | like have a trigger to trigger dictation, you know, why not, you know, because obviously              |
| 35:42      | you can start a dictation through the keyboard, why not turn that into an action.                     |
| 35:46      | And then all of a sudden I could like combine that into other shortcuts on Vision OS.                 |
| 35:52      | I'd also like to see them look into some of the, I guess, more detailed problems you're               |
| 35:57      | having like, for instance, shooting video on this thing, it looks fine when you're wearing            |
| 36:01      | it, but the video itself comes out very kind of like, it moves around a lot because anytime           |
| 36:06      | your head tilts or moves to the slide as the video moves, and maybe they could introduce              |
| 36:11      | a like locked in stabilisation kind of thing where it, it just, you know, treats the head             |
| 36:18      | as stable during the video shoot.                                                                     |
| 36:21      | Maybe that's just a screen caster problem, but I feel like that's the kind of stuff shortcuts          |
| 36:25      | should be good at fixing for us.                                                                      |
| 36:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 36:30      | And fingers crossed, you know, where we're going to see the, you know, all of these things            |
| 36:34      | slowly improve over time because, you know, there's, there's only so much to come with                |
| 36:39      | the 1.0 edition, right?                                                                               |
| 36:41      | And I feel like the obvious example is that focus mode filters aren't there.                          |
| 36:48      | Like focus mode filters.                                                                              |
| 36:50      | And I feel like focus mode filters probably ought to be there.                                        |
| 36:53      | I suspect they intended for it to be there and it got missed as an oversight or there                 |
| 36:58      | was a crunch and whoever was working on it had to say, no, we're not, we're not putting               |
| 37:03      | this in the 1.0, the fingers crossed that'll be there soon.                                           |
| 37:07      | And, you know, that this is the sort of thing that we, you know, will hopefully, you know,            |
| 37:12      | eventually see in the not too distant future with, with stuff like that, because focus                |
| 37:17      | mode filters, you know, it's, it's stuff like being able to say like, okay, when I open,              |
| 37:22      | you know, [[Drafts]] filter me to this workspace, or when I open mail, like filter my, my mailbox         |
| 37:30      | to, to, to just, you know, this account or these two accounts and things like that.                   |
| 37:35      | And I feel like that is an obvious extension of the, the automation that people expect from           |
| 37:40      | this sort of thing, but we're just going to have to, you know, wait and see what happens              |
| 37:44      | in the betas because yeah, it's, it's going to be exciting, hopefully.                                |
| 37:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 37:50      | And it's interesting because the, we always heard kind of in the rumour mill that the hardware         |
| 37:55      | was done and the software was, was some of the delay on the release of the product.                   |
| 38:01      | But a lot of the software isn't there.                                                                |
| 38:03      | Like it's shocking to me that the Reminders app doesn't have a native vision OS application.          |
| 38:09      | I mean, Reminders, I mean, that's Apple's big push at a task manager app, you know, and               |
| 38:17      | it's not a native app or calendar that, you know, the native calendar app is [[Fantastical]].             |
| 38:24      | It's not the [[Apple Calendar]] app because they didn't get a native app out.                             |
| 38:27      | And like I said, it's a subpar experience.                                                            |
| 38:30      | They're not terrible.                                                                                 |
| 38:32      | Some of the iPad apps work fine.                                                                      |
| 38:33      | I feel like the day one app works pretty good, but the cat, you know, when you have a native          |
| 38:38      | vision OS app, it's just a better experience when you're in that headset.                             |
| 38:42      | And it's just a little surprising to me, like I can almost forgive shortcuts because of               |
| 38:48      | the nature of the application, but I feel like the productivity apps should have been                 |
| 38:52      | there.                                                                                                |
| 38:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:54      | And I think, I think this is one of these things as well, like shortcuts in particular,               |
| 38:57      | it makes sense for them to be focusing on, you know, all of the other things, right?                  |
| 39:01      | So that they, you know, they don't have to, you know, create something that then like                 |
| 39:08      | they've spent all this time creating it and you're like, oh, great, amazing shortcuts                 |
| 39:13      | is there on vision OS.                                                                                |
| 39:14      | And that's like asterisk, but none of the actions are, right?                                         |
| 39:20      | Because that's what you don't want like shortcuts to be a great native app.                           |
| 39:23      | And then none of the actions that you want to be there because of just the simple fact                |
| 39:28      | that, you know, none of the apps that things are using are there yet.                                 |
| 39:33      | So yeah, fingers crossed, we will actually see, you know, all of this happen in the not               |
| 39:38      | too distant future with all of these things, but as it is, we'll have to wait and see.                |
| 39:43      | I feel like for me, the priority on shortcuts was make sure the pipes are connected.                  |
| 39:47      | Like when he clicks a focus mode shortcut, make sure the focus mode turns on and mission              |
| 39:54      | accomplished, it does that.                                                                           |
| 39:56      | But I feel like there are several more steps there, you know, native app, vision OS specific          |
| 40:03      | actions, all that stuff remains to be done and hopefully we get it.                                   |
| 40:07      | But I wouldn't be surprised if that stuff doesn't show up until June or later.                        |
| 40:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:14      | June to September seems realistic.                                                                    |
| 40:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:16      | But in my heart, I'd really like to see it like when they, they make the announcements                |
| 40:20      | at WWDC and say, and we have a native reminders app, a native calendars app, a native shortcuts       |
| 40:26      | app and, you know, app specific or platform specific actions and shortcuts, like, you                 |
| 40:31      | know, just kind of like finish that, that roll out with stuff.                                        |
| 40:36      | I'd be disappointed if we got to the next version of iOS or vision OS and all those                   |
| 40:43      | apps are still iPad apps.                                                                             |
| 40:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:46      | But at the same time, you know, if the shortcuts team doesn't have a huge number of people working    |
| 40:51      | on it, I, in some ways, would rather they spent their time working on, you know, the                  |
| 40:56      | iPad app and the iPhone app and the Mac app and making those greater and bringing those               |
| 41:02      | changes across to Vision Pro with it in its current iPad form.                                        |
| 41:07      | And then as the Vision Pro gets more popular, then spending the time after they've had feedback       |
| 41:12      | from people about how they wanted to work and what they feel like they're missing to                  |
| 41:17      | be able to integrate that.                                                                            |
| 41:19      | Because otherwise, you know, there's so many, so many hours in a day and with all these               |
| 41:22      | things, you know, it is, it's not a choice of yes and it's usually either or and it's                 |
| 41:28      | an exclusive, you can have this or you can have that, but you cannot have both.                       |
| 41:33      | And you know, in an ideal world, of course, we would have both for everything.                        |
| 41:38      | But at the same time, I wouldn't want the shortcuts team to be put under a huge amount                |
| 41:41      | of pressure to create something that then, you know, is not something that we, you know,              |
| 41:47      | most people can use because while Vision Pro is not available outside of the United States,           |
| 41:52      | you know, there's a limited audience for very understandable reasons.                                 |
| 41:55      | So, you know, if I can't buy one, you know, I'm not the only person not in the US who                 |
| 42:00      | loves shortcuts.                                                                                      |
| 42:01      | So fingers crossed, you know, as it becomes more available around the world, it will also             |
| 42:07      | become, you know, more available with regards to the software that is on it.                          |
| 42:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 42:13      | And that's something of human mind as a relative platform size.                                       |
| 42:15      | I think, I think the estimates are, you know, if Apple's really fortunate and able to get             |
| 42:22      | all the parts that they're going to sell a million of these, whereas there are billions               |
| 42:26      | of iPhones.                                                                                           |
| 42:27      | So, so I understand the relative importance of the platforms, but I also want it all.                 |
| 42:33      | And I want this to be something where shortcut is just one more place that shortcuts is a             |
| 42:39      | happy, you know, app that does really good things for people that use it.                             |
| 42:43      | So hopefully that comes.                                                                              |
| 42:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 42:45      | Because I have to remember the chicken and the egg problem, right?                                    |
| 42:48      | Microsoft's Windows phone, it was never really popular because there weren't really any apps.         |
| 42:52      | And so there weren't users because there weren't apps, but there weren't apps because there           |
| 42:54      | weren't users.                                                                                        |
| 42:56      | And I feel like Vision Pro is, you know, it's, it's potentially in danger of having                   |
| 43:01      | that same problem of developers won't spend time working on it because it's a very expensive          |
| 43:05      | piece of hardware that most users won't purchase, but most users won't purchase it unless the         |
| 43:10      | apps that they're looking for aren't there.                                                           |
| 43:12      | And you know, we see, you know, there, there've been these headlines about things like, you           |
| 43:17      | know, the YouTube app not being available on Vision Pro and things like that.                         |
| 43:20      | And you know, Christian Selig, the creator of Apollo for Reddit, which unfortunately                  |
| 43:25      | had to close down because of Reddit's changes, also created PixelPals.                                |
| 43:28      | He created a great YouTube app for this, but the headlines are still that there isn't a               |
| 43:33      | YouTube app, not that there's a great alternative YouTube app.                                        |
| 43:36      | So you know, we're going to have to wait and see what happens there.                                  |
| 43:40      | But I'm hoping that because this is Apple and the Apple name is behind it, the Apple                  |
| 43:44      | branding is on it and it's Apple hardware, that we're going to see this be incredibly                 |
| 43:49      | popular.                                                                                              |
| 43:50      | And this, this won't be like another airpower charging pad where, you know, it gets talked            |
| 43:55      | about and, you know, this time it's got all the way out, but hopefully it will continue               |
| 43:59      | to be there and be available for everyone.                                                            |
| 44:01      | Well, I'm actually very optimistic on that front for a couple of reasons.                             |
| 44:05      | You know, the notable exceptions, YouTube and Netflix, they had perfectly working iPad                |
| 44:11      | apps, but chose not to make them available.                                                           |
| 44:15      | I mean, so they actually actively took themselves out of this platform.                               |
| 44:19      | And I think that's more corporate politics than, than app developer questions.                        |
| 44:25      | And actually, since it's released, I've heard from multiple developers, you and I know                |
| 44:30      | a lot of developers, you are a developer who are like now getting on board and saying,                |
| 44:35      | I wanted to get the hardware in my hands before I started doing something, but now I've got           |
| 44:39      | some ideas and, and Apple has created an architecture.                                                |
| 44:42      | We're making an app for the iPad or the iPhone is very similar to making an app for Vision            |
| 44:48      | OS.                                                                                                   |
| 44:49      | So it's not the kind of boil the ocean product that you have to do to show up on the platform.        |
| 44:55      | If you already know how to make an app for the other Apple platforms, it's not going                  |
| 44:59      | to be that hard to make one here.                                                                     |
| 45:02      | It's like the IECO app is a good example, it's a simple AI, you know, voice to text                   |
| 45:07      | app, but he made it for iPhone, iPad and Mac.                                                         |
| 45:11      | And then when the Vision OS came out, he made a version for that and it looks good.                   |
| 45:16      | And it's, you know, it's a native app that does a simple thing.                                       |
| 45:19      | And there's a lot of apps out there that do a simple thing that could come over to Vision             |
| 45:23      | OS pretty quickly if the developers decide to, to support it.                                         |
| 45:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 45:28      | So we'll just have to wait and see.                                                                   |
| 45:30      | If a finger is crossed, it can only get better from here on out.                                      |
| 45:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 45:34      | This won't be the last time we talk about automation with Vision OS.                                  |
| 45:37      | Maybe the next time we talk about it, Rose will have a headset, but if not, I will carry              |
| 45:42      | the load for you, Rose, I will, I've spent the money now, so I'm in and we'll see how                 |
| 45:48      | that goes.                                                                                            |
| 45:49      | So we'll be checking on that.                                                                         |

| 45:54      | we'll keep that in mind with future programming.                                                      |
| 45:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |

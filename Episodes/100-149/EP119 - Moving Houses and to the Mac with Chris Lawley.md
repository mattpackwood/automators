| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the Automation Podcast, where we make all of your technology            |
| 00:06      | do your magic bidding for you.                                                                            |
| 00:08      | Yes, magic, because why not?                                                                              |
| 00:10      | I am Rosemary Orchardt and joined as always by David Sparks.                                              |
| 00:13      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                  |
| 00:14      | Great.                                                                                                    |
| 00:15      | How are you today, Rose?                                                                                  |
| 00:16      | This is our first show of the new year, our first show we've recorded in the new year                     |
| 00:19      | at least.                                                                                                 |
| 00:20      | I'm really excited to start automating.                                                                   |
| 00:23      | Yeah, yeah, me too.                                                                                       |
| 00:25      | We got a special guest in for today, because of course, you know, start the new year, get                 |
| 00:28      | some phrases back that we've seen before, and we've got some other folks queued up who                    |
| 00:32      | maybe you haven't heard from on the Automators podcast for future episodes, but welcome                   |
| 00:36      | back to the show, Chris Lawley.                                                                             |
| 00:38      | Hey, thank you for having me.                                                                             |
| 00:40      | I am super excited to be back.                                                                            |
| 00:41      | I'm honoured to be your first guest of 2023.                                                               |
| 00:44      | It's so good that it just worked out perfectly.                                                           |
| 00:48      | I messaged you, you were listening to the show, you're not working until next week, so it's               |
| 00:52      | like perfect timing, let's get Chris on the show, and you've got some really great things                 |
| 00:58      | that in the show notes that I'm excited to dive into, David, I don't know, I've been                      |
| 01:05      | looking at this and I feel like a kid in a sweet shop.                                                    |
| 01:08      | There's just all of the shiny things, and I want to talk about all of them.                               |
| 01:12      | So Chris, you're booked for the next five episodes, just wait for my eye, because I                       |
| 01:17      | think-                                                                                                    |
| 01:18      | As long as we're not recording next week, because none of my podcast stuff will be set                    |
| 01:20      | up next week, because I'm moving, but anytime after that, I'm yours.                                      |
| 01:25      | Excellent.                                                                                                |
| 01:26      | Awesome.                                                                                                  |
| 01:27      | Excellent.                                                                                                |
| 01:28      | And as this episode goes out, the previous episode of iOS Today that went out, you're                     |
| 01:33      | actually standing in for me, Chris, because while you might be moving as this episode                     |
| 01:37      | releases, I'm also on holiday.                                                                            |
| 01:39      | So we're actually doing a little switcheroo there, which is quite fun.                                    |
| 01:43      | It's like my week of Rosemary.                                                                            |
| 01:46      | Well, as long as that works out, fun for you, I'm looking forward to watching the episode                 |
| 01:51      | of iOS Today once it releases next week, because we're recording slightly ahead of that.                  |
| 01:56      | But yeah, in the meantime, maybe, David, I don't know if you're ready for this, because                   |
| 02:01      | I've been dragging you down the [[Home Assistant]] rabbit hole recently, but Chris, you're moving.            |
| 02:06      | So you must be thinking smart home and things like, what are you doing?                                   |
| 02:11      | Are you doing a nuke and pave?                                                                              |
| 02:13      | Are you starting over from scratch?                                                                       |
| 02:14      | Are you carefully labeling every smart bulb that you've got with which room it's in so                    |
| 02:18      | that you can put it into the socket in the room in the new house and keep your automations                |
| 02:23      | working?                                                                                                  |
| 02:24      | What's going to happen there?                                                                             |
| 02:25      | So we're kind of at this weird time with smart home stuff, because we have matter and then                |
| 02:30      | there's all the thread stuff.                                                                             |
| 02:31      | So I don't want to just delete all the stuff that I have, and I don't have too much as                    |
| 02:37      | it is right now, because right now in this moment, I'm in an apartment.                                   |
| 02:41      | And when you're renting, there's not a whole lot you can do.                                              |
| 02:44      | You're not going to be able to replace ceiling fans or thermostats or I don't have an attached            |
| 02:49      | garage or anything like that.                                                                             |
| 02:50      | So there's not a whole lot I can do.                                                                      |
| 02:54      | One thing I do have is light bulbs and HomePods.                                                         |
| 02:58      | Those are the things I have just gone full throttle into.                                                 |
| 03:05      | And I'm doing that even more in this new place.                                                           |
| 03:07      | So I've been deep into the Philips Hue stuff for a while.                                                 |
| 03:12      | I am going to stick on the Philips Hue train for now until I kind of see what's happening                 |
| 03:18      | with Lutron Casetta and what's going to happen with all that matter stuff, is it going to                 |
| 03:25      | matter?                                                                                                   |
| 03:26      | But I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.                                                                              |
| 03:28      | You just lost half your audience there.                                                                   |
| 03:31      | So I'm really excited for this, but it's kind of this volatile time.                                      |
| 03:36      | So I'm kind of taking it a little easy.                                                                   |
| 03:39      | I have ordered an extra set of HomePod minis.                                                            |
| 03:42      | So this will be my third set of HomePods.                                                                |
| 03:46      | So this way I will have two HomePod minis in the kitchen, two HomePod minis in the                      |
| 03:53      | bedroom, and an original HomePod pair in my office, which I use every single day for                     |
| 04:00      | when I'm filming B-roll or just hanging out in here and play music.                                       |
| 04:05      | And what I'm doing is I set up a shortcut that plays music throughout the house.                          |
| 04:11      | And what's weird, I don't know, this one always kind of bugs me.                                          |
| 04:16      | I don't know about you guys, but the only way to get shortcuts to play music to multiple                  |
| 04:22      | sets of HomePods is actually through a home action.                                                      |
| 04:26      | Like the handoff actions don't do multiple sets.                                                          |
| 04:31      | But they do.                                                                                              |
| 04:32      | They do?                                                                                                  |
| 04:33      | Wait, what?                                                                                               |
| 04:34      | They do.                                                                                                  |
| 04:35      | So this is something.                                                                                     |
| 04:36      | I think I actually found this from [[Matthew Cassinelli]].                                                    |
| 04:39      | So when you look at the set playback destination action, and this is something that's kind                |
| 04:44      | of sneaky, I believe it's set playback destination.                                                       |
| 04:47      | I'm having that lovely bug where shortcuts take a little while to load your actions and                   |
| 04:50      | it loads one list and then that list updates in front of you as you go to swipe and tap                   |
| 04:55      | on it.                                                                                                    |
| 04:56      | So I'm just giving it a moment to consider its life choices.                                              |
| 05:01      | And it's just updated again.                                                                              |
| 05:02      | Yay.                                                                                                      |
| 05:03      | And again.                                                                                                |
| 05:04      | Oh, gosh.                                                                                                 |
| 05:05      | Well, this is good fun.                                                                                   |
| 05:06      | So there we go.                                                                                           |
| 05:07      | Change playback destination.                                                                              |
| 05:08      | It's a scripting action, which may make it more fun.                                                      |
| 05:10      | But if you tap on that set, then you can add, okay, and so then you can add your HomePod                 |
| 05:17      | or something.                                                                                             |
| 05:18      | And you may need multiple of these actions to add everything that you need, but you can                   |
| 05:24      | absolutely do it in shortcuts.                                                                            |
| 05:26      | That said, I found home actions perhaps to be a little more reliable.                                     |
| 05:32      | I've had a little thing recently where my bedroom HomePods have been playing the same                    |
| 05:37      | thing as other speakers, and then they've kind of lagged and dropped out, and then they                   |
| 05:42      | come back again.                                                                                          |
| 05:43      | And it's been a little bit confusing.                                                                     |
| 05:45      | But then I shuffled my arrows because I'd been messing with my office setup, and so                       |
| 05:49      | I've moved one arrow from one wall at the office to another wall at the office.                           |
| 05:53      | I think I shouldn't have done that.                                                                       |
| 05:55      | I moved it back, and things seem to have gone back to normal since then.                                  |
| 05:58      | My Apple TV and my bedroom works better now as well.                                                      |
| 06:01      | But yeah, so if you tap on the set part of that set playback destination action, then                     |
| 06:08      | you can change it to add, and then you can add more things to it.                                         |
| 06:11      | Or you can remove something from your playback destination if you don't want it there anymore.            |
| 06:15      | Oh, okay.                                                                                                 |
| 06:16      | So that's where I was going wrong then.                                                                   |
| 06:18      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 06:19      | That makes sense.                                                                                         |
| 06:20      | But I've always been using the home action because that must be fairly new.                               |
| 06:27      | Because I remember distinctly at one point we were all complaining because the only way                   |
| 06:31      | you could do this was through the home action.                                                            |
| 06:34      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 06:35      | So the playback destination has been around for a while, but I believe the changing it                    |
| 06:40      | from just setting it to one particular endpoint to multiple endpoints came around sometime                |
| 06:46      | in iOS 15.                                                                                                |
| 06:48      | And yeah, it's one of those ones that kind of snuck under the radar, but it's an incredibly               |
| 06:53      | useful action, and I certainly appreciate the fact that it's there.                                       |
| 06:58      | That's it.                                                                                                |
| 06:59      | Well, it's there, but it's only there on mobile.                                                          |
| 07:03      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 07:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 07:05      | It's not there on the Mac.                                                                                |
| 07:06      | It's not there on the Mac?                                                                                |
| 07:08      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 07:09      | It makes me crazy because like you, I have two in my studio and I love kicking off music,                 |
| 07:16      | but I was wondering, oh yeah, I have to do that on the phone because otherwise I can't                    |
| 07:19      | address my HomePods.                                                                                      |
| 07:21      | So I guess that is a benefit of using the home action then because the home action is                     |
| 07:26      | on the Mac.                                                                                               |
| 07:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 07:28      | I'm looking at it right now, and that may be one of the reasons why I also didn't notice                  |
| 07:32      | the set playback thing because since I've last got on the show, I've gotten really back                   |
| 07:37      | into the Mac.                                                                                             |
| 07:38      | I still really like the iPad, nobody freak out, but I've been using the Mac a bit more                    |
| 07:46      | as well.                                                                                                  |
| 07:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 07:48      | Speaking of the Mac and shortcuts, have either of you had, you try to open the shortcuts                  |
| 07:54      | app on the Mac and it just bounces in the dock and it bounces in the dock and they bounce                 |
| 07:58      | in the dock and eventually it crashes because I think on this Mac, I've not been able to                  |
| 08:02      | open the shortcuts app in over a month now.                                                               |
| 08:04      | In fact, it must be over a month because it was sometime like in November that I was doing                |
| 08:09      | something in shortcuts on this Mac, and then since then it's just not opened.                             |
| 08:14      | It opens on all of my other devices.                                                                      |
| 08:16      | It works perfectly everywhere else, but not on this Mac for some reason.                                  |
| 08:20      | It's driving me crazy.                                                                                    |
| 08:21      | It doesn't happen to me every time, but since I've upgraded to Ventura, it happens every                  |
| 08:26      | once in a while, and the only fix that I've had for it is rebooting my Mac.                               |
| 08:32      | I tried rebooting.                                                                                        |
| 08:33      | I've just noticed there's another Ventura update that I can install, so I'll do that                      |
| 08:37      | after the show and see if maybe that fixes it, but I have reported this to Apple and                      |
| 08:41      | then I got a message back from whoever is triaging the support thing saying, what did                    |
| 08:45      | you do?                                                                                                   |
| 08:46      | I'm like, as I wrote, I tried to open the shortcuts app.                                                  |
| 08:50      | It works everywhere else, just not here, and there's some kind of thread fault or something.              |
| 08:56      | I don't remember what it was, but it's trying to access something that doesn't have permission            |
| 08:59      | to access, and then it tries to do that multiple times and then goes, well, I don't know what             |
| 09:04      | I'm doing.                                                                                                |
| 09:05      | But yes, it's one of those things where it's making it a little problematic to read Mac                   |
| 09:11      | OS shortcuts actions as we record the show, but aside from that, shortcuts is working                     |
| 09:15      | pretty well for me.                                                                                       |
| 09:17      | Going back to playing music, I actually use home actions, and I actually call them through                |
| 09:22      | push cut so that I can have them triggered with my alarm clock in the morning.                            |
| 09:29      | When my alarm goes off in the morning, because there's that shortcuts automation trigger for              |
| 09:36      | when your wake up alarm goes off, and this is only available, sleep stuff is only available               |
| 09:40      | on iPhone.                                                                                                |
| 09:41      | If your sleep focus is enabled on your iPad, you can't use that as an automation trigger                  |
| 09:45      | or turning it off, can't be used as an automation trigger.                                                |
| 09:48      | You can use your wake up alarm or waking up specifically as a trigger on your iPhone.                     |
| 09:55      | What I do on my iPhone is I actually have that ping home assistant and go, hey, Rose                      |
| 10:00      | is awake, and then that does a number of things, including depending on how early it is.                  |
| 10:07      | If I have to get up five o'clock in the morning for some reason, I'm not going to play music,             |
| 10:10      | even quietly just in case it disturbs my neighbours, but it will check and then play                       |
| 10:15      | music appropriately using the home action and push cut.                                                   |
| 10:18      | I should probably simplify that and just do that on my phone, but as it is, it works right                |
| 10:23      | now, so I guess I'll leave it alone until I have the ears to tinker or something else,                    |
| 10:27      | but the home actions do work very well for things like that because you can tie that                      |
| 10:31      | into a part of another automation.                                                                        |
| 10:34      | You can have it turn on lights and do this and that as part of one or more scenes and                     |
| 10:39      | then activate those through shortcuts.                                                                    |
| 10:42      | I do something very similar to that because I'm somebody that will... I have a hard time                  |
| 10:47      | getting out of bed in the morning.                                                                        |
| 10:48      | I'll just lay in bed if no lights come on, so I have a automation tied to when my alarm                   |
| 10:55      | goes off, it turns on my bedroom light to 10% and then waits 60 seconds and because of                    |
| 11:02      | shortcut bugs, sometimes it's 60 seconds, sometimes it's longer than 60 seconds.                          |
| 11:07      | It will then turn those bedroom lights onto 100%, which will wake me right up, so it forces               |
| 11:15      | me to get out of bed.                                                                                     |
| 11:16      | It's almost like a cattle prod to just get me going and like, hey, you got to get to                      |
| 11:22      | work.                                                                                                     |
| 11:23      | Oh yeah, this is... When I hit the snooze button on my alarm, if it's my wake up alarm,                   |
| 11:28      | then it runs a shortcuts action using a great app called Signals for HomeKit.                             |
| 11:34      | What that does is, Signals can flash lights to specific colours and brightnesses and then                  |
| 11:38      | restore them to how they were or set them to something else.                                              |
| 11:42      | What this does is when I hit snooze, it actually increases the volume on my HomePods.                    |
| 11:50      | Not by a lot, to be clear, because again, I have neighbours and I want them to not want                    |
| 11:55      | to evict me or murder me.                                                                                 |
| 11:56      | That seems like a good idea.                                                                              |
| 11:57      | It increases the volume on my HomePods slightly and then flashes my bedroom lights in a blue             |
| 12:04      | colour or a white colour, depending on just a semi-random pick, so that I can actually                      |
| 12:13      | flash lights at myself really, really brightly, and then it sets them to a cool white and                 |
| 12:19      | 100% to try and get me to wake up.                                                                        |
| 12:24      | My snooze alarm is something that I'm training myself out of hitting, which is probably for               |
| 12:28      | the best because I'm tempted to hit snooze a lot, unfortunately.                                          |
| 12:32      | Chris, before we move on, I just want to talk about your HomePods a little bit.                          |
| 12:36      | You've got the big ones, a pair of the big ones, and you've got multiple sets of the                      |
| 12:41      | smaller ones.                                                                                             |
| 12:43      | What's your impression of that?                                                                           |
| 12:44      | How are the smaller ones doing compared to the big ones?                                                  |
| 12:48      | The smaller ones work.                                                                                    |
| 12:52      | They're fine for podcasts.                                                                                |
| 12:53      | I don't like them for music.                                                                              |
| 12:55      | They don't have that umph the original ones have.                                                         |
| 12:57      | I'm still better at Apple for cancelling or getting rid of the original ones without                      |
| 13:02      | coming out with a replacement for them.                                                                   |
| 13:05      | My original ones are barely hanging on.                                                                   |
| 13:09      | They struggle.                                                                                            |
| 13:11      | A lot of times, they will get, so they're in a stereo pair, so a lot of times one will                    |
| 13:16      | just stop playing music.                                                                                  |
| 13:19      | It's usually the left one.                                                                                |
| 13:20      | I don't know if there's something, I don't know, but it's usually the left one, so I                      |
| 13:23      | have to go in and unplug it.                                                                              |
| 13:25      | In fact, I've actually got to the point where I'm so tired of having to crawl behind the                  |
| 13:30      | bookshelf that they're on to unplug them that I put a smart power strip back behind there                 |
| 13:36      | so I can just toggle it from home kit and just reboot them that way.                                      |
| 13:42      | I very much want Apple to do big HomePods again.                                                         |
| 13:47      | I also just bought for my new apartment a sound bar, sound system thing.                                  |
| 13:53      | It's a sound bar, but it's also got the rear speakers and a subwoofer as well.                            |
| 13:58      | It has AirPlay too, so I will actually be able to add that to my shortcut for playing                     |
| 14:04      | music throughout the house.                                                                               |
| 14:06      | Not only will it play to the HomePods, but it'll also play in the living room where that                 |
| 14:10      | will be set up as well.                                                                                   |
| 14:12      | I'm very much looking forward to that configuration, but I would very much appreciate if Apple            |
| 14:18      | made something with a little more oomph than the HomePod minis because they just don't                   |
| 14:22      | have that sound the original ones have.                                                                   |
| 14:26      | I'm not an audio person.                                                                                  |
| 14:27      | I don't know what the terms are.                                                                          |
| 14:28      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:29      | To me, I agree.                                                                                           |
| 14:30      | It's so obvious how much better they are.                                                                 |
| 14:33      | Like you, I have some that are doing fine, but from what I hear, one day they're just                     |
| 14:38      | going to quit on me, which is kind of sad too because they were quite expensive, but                      |
| 14:43      | they're great.                                                                                            |
| 14:44      | A related automation I do before we move on to sound is I also do [[Dark Noise]] ones like                    |
| 14:50      | this where I've got one where just the room where I say, bring the rain and it brings                     |
| 14:55      | the rain or if I say, bring all the rain, and out of you've heard the story about Prince                  |
| 15:03      | in the Super Bowl that he was supposed to play the Super Bowl and it started raining                      |
| 15:09      | and he called the guy and said, I only have one request, make it rain harder, you know,                   |
| 15:13      | and so I use that for my, I have that for, so if I want it, like if I'm home alone, I'll                  |
| 15:17      | have every HomePod in the house playing it.                                                              |
| 15:20      | If it's just me here with family, then I'll shut the door and just have the studios play.                 |
| 15:24      | But yeah, I agree.                                                                                        |
| 15:26      | The whole triggering for sound is a great automation tool, but it's a little too fitly.                   |
| 15:32      | All needs to fix some things.                                                                             |
| 15:34      | Well, I have two things that I'm going to suggest.                                                        |
| 15:38      | First of all, Chris, if you haven't tried like decoupling your HomePods as a stereo                      |
| 15:43      | pair and then rebooting them and then recoupling them, try that because I had the same issue              |
| 15:49      | with my office HomePods.                                                                                 |
| 15:50      | So I unpaired them, which was great because it also gave me the opportunity to rename                     |
| 15:53      | them.                                                                                                     |
| 15:54      | So I now have office HomePod window and office HomePod door instead of right and left where             |
| 15:59      | right and left are really subjective depending on where you're in the room.                               |
| 16:02      | So I've actually stopped naming things left and right.                                                    |
| 16:05      | The exception I've made for this is my wardrobe because, like I could go and stand inside                 |
| 16:09      | my wardrobe, but it would be pretty cramped to get in there.                                              |
| 16:12      | It's not a walk-in wardrobe.                                                                              |
| 16:14      | So I've made that.                                                                                        |
| 16:15      | Wait, I thought every wardrobe in the UK led to Narnia, isn't there another door?                         |
| 16:20      | Oh, it still leads to Narnia.                                                                             |
| 16:22      | It leads to Narnia.                                                                                       |
| 16:23      | It's just a case of like getting in there, like I have clothes, David.                                    |
| 16:25      | I have dresses.                                                                                           |
| 16:26      | And there's a line and a witch in there as well, right?                                                   |
| 16:29      | Well, definitely.                                                                                         |
| 16:30      | Definitely.                                                                                               |
| 16:31      | So let's not talk about all the mythical creatures as well because they're fabulous.                      |
| 16:35      | But yeah, so in general, I've stopped naming things like left and right.                                  |
| 16:38      | And so I've renamed them and when I unpaired my HomePod pair, like you can identify them                 |
| 16:43      | while they're in the pair, but it just gave me an opportunity to like rename them more                    |
| 16:46      | appropriately and sort that and then pair them back together.                                             |
| 16:50      | And since then, fingers crossed, touch wood, they seem to be working fine.                                |
| 16:55      | So that's certainly worth looking at, especially as you're moving, you know, it's an ideal                |
| 16:58      | time to sort of break them and then put them back together from a digital perspective, not                |
| 17:03      | a physical perspective.                                                                                   |
| 17:05      | But my other recommendation that I think is worth looking at, if people are looking for                   |
| 17:09      | smart speakers with airplay support, and maybe you already have HomePod minis and you want               |
| 17:15      | to keep Siri as your voice assistant, but you're in love with the sound, are the IKEA                     |
| 17:19      | symphonist range.                                                                                         |
| 17:21      | Because the IKEA symphonist range are Sonos speakers, but they're made by IKEA, so they're                |
| 17:26      | cheaper.                                                                                                  |
| 17:27      | They have a symphonist picture frame, and I absolutely love it.                                           |
| 17:31      | It's great.                                                                                               |
| 17:32      | I do have a Sonos Roam as well, which I take into the bathroom with me so that I can, you                 |
| 17:36      | know, use it while I'm showering.                                                                         |
| 17:37      | I don't take it in the shower, but I put it next to the shower.                                           |
| 17:39      | It is, I think, waterproof slash resistant, something I keep it out of the way at the                     |
| 17:44      | spray either way, and try and not get water directly on it, but it's pretty great for                     |
| 17:49      | that.                                                                                                     |
| 17:50      | But IKEA sell speakers starting from like $99 with AirPlay 2 built in, and so they have                   |
| 17:56      | home kit support.                                                                                         |
| 17:59      | And I think that that's certainly worth looking at for folks.                                             |
| 18:02      | They have like stands that you can put them on.                                                           |
| 18:05      | They even have like a wall mount for one of their speakers with like a wireless charger                   |
| 18:09      | underneath it so that you can like mount it on the wall by your bed, have a speaker and                   |
| 18:13      | a charger for your phone, which is quite cool.                                                            |
| 18:15      | And they do all sorts of artwork for the picture frame.                                                   |
| 18:18      | I may have to pick up some new art for my picture frame.                                                  |
| 18:20      | I like what I've got in there, but maybe I should think about changing it up every once                   |
| 18:24      | in a while.                                                                                               |
| 18:25      | But it's certainly worth looking at.                                                                      |
| 18:26      | I'm really pleased with my symphonist stuff, and it works super well.                                     |
| 18:32      | And yeah, personally, I'm not a fan of how the lamps look.                                                |
| 18:36      | They are not my taste at all, but I know that some people love that look, and for the folks               |
| 18:40      | that don't love that, then there's the bookshelf speakers that you can look at or the picture             |
| 18:45      | frame option.                                                                                             |
| 18:46      | And, you know, it's so many speakers in IKEA housing, so cheaper, which is certainly worth                |
| 18:51      | considering.                                                                                              |
| 18:52      | Interesting, yeah, I will have to look into that.                                                         |
| 18:56      | I thought about going into the Sonos world when I was moving and stuff, but it's so pricey.               |
| 19:06      | To get the same kind of speaker configuration that I ordered for my new place, it would                   |
| 19:11      | have been about four times the cost.                                                                      |
| 19:13      | So I was just like, no, I'm good.                                                                         |
| 19:17      | That's a little too much for me right now.                                                                |
| 19:19      | But I could see me doing it in the future, for sure.                                                      |
| 19:22      | Yeah, yeah, no, I nearly, before Christmas, talked myself into buying a Sonos soundbar,                   |
| 19:27      | because I was getting annoyed my Logitech Harmony Hub's been having a couple of issues                    |
| 19:31      | turning on specifically my soundbar.                                                                      |
| 19:34      | I mean, a soundbar was going to sleep at times, like when I paused the TV and wandered off                |
| 19:39      | for a bit, I would have the Apple screens, they were kicking and so on, like come back                    |
| 19:42      | and hit play, and there'd be no sound, and I'd have to like scrabble around and toggle                    |
| 19:47      | the soundbar to turn it back on.                                                                          |
| 19:49      | And so I was like, okay, this is it, I've got an excuse, I'm upgrading to a Sonos soundbar.               |
| 19:53      | And then I really stupidly Googled my Bose soundbar and found out that there was a standby                |
| 19:58      | option that I could turn on where it wouldn't actually turn off.                                          |
| 20:01      | So I saved myself a couple of hundred by doing that.                                                      |
| 20:04      | So it's probably for the best I did that, you know, e-waste and everything as well as                     |
| 20:08      | saving money.                                                                                             |
| 20:09      | But yeah, I didn't enable myself into a Sonos soundbar, because the one thing I would love                |
| 20:13      | is if it had airplay support, but I've got a HomePod in that room, it's a black HomePod                   |
| 20:20      | I picked up on eBay, pretty much unused, and yeah, it works great.                                        |
| 20:26      | So yeah, I'm okay with airplay support in every room, I've got serial listening everywhere,               |
| 20:31      | it feels like, so I think I'm okay, but especially as you already got, you know, HomePod minis            |
| 20:37      | Chris that you could dot around for listening to voice interactions, you know, throwing                   |
| 20:42      | some other smart speakers in there to do the actual music playing might be a good solution                |
| 20:47      | to some of the problem.                                                                                   |
| 20:48      | Yeah, that would be really good.                                                                          |
| 20:53      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                               |
| 20:56      | We all know how VPN protects your privacy and security online, but here's something                       |
| 21:00      | you might not know.                                                                                       |
| 21:01      | You can also use ExpressVPN to unlock movies and shows that are only available in other                   |
| 21:04      | countries.                                                                                                |
| 21:05      | If you've run out of stuff to watch on Netflix, this will change your world.                              |
| 21:09      | So I've used this to do all sorts of things at the moment, I am actually using this to                    |
| 21:14      | get around the fact that the internet provider that I'm currently using doesn't actually                  |
| 21:17      | correctly let me access things like GitHub, which is weird, but I've used this to finish                  |
| 21:23      | watching a show that I started on Netflix in Austria when I then went the whole day                       |
| 21:28      | to the US and many other things.                                                                          |
| 21:31      | So it's really nice to just be able to quickly tap one little thing in ExpressVPN and pick                |
| 21:36      | up, say, Brooklyn Nine-Nine or How I Met Your Mother, without having to figure out the geoblock           |
| 21:41      | that's only applicable in one country suddenly in the middle of a show.                                   |
| 21:46      | ExpressVPN lets you control where you want sites to think you're located.                                 |
| 21:49      | You can choose from almost 100 different countries, so just imagine all those Netflix                     |
| 21:52      | libraries you can go through.                                                                             |
| 21:53      | If you love Korean dramas, you can use ExpressVPN to watch Parasite on South Korean Netflix.              |
| 21:58      | And it's not just Netflix.                                                                                |

| 22:39      | Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                              |
| 22:44      | All right, Chris, so you're getting into this new space.                                                  |
| 22:48      | You got your speakers sorted out.                                                                         |
| 22:50      | What other home automation things are you thinking about bringing along or setting up?                    |
| 22:56      | So one thing I absolutely hate doing is vacuuming.                                                        |
| 23:00      | I don't know why, but if I put off vacuuming way too long and I just don't want to do it.                 |
| 23:08      | So my current place isn't too big.                                                                        |
| 23:10      | I have a Roomba, but my problem is I work from home.                                                      |
| 23:14      | So the Roomba never runs because I'm home.                                                                |
| 23:17      | So with this new place, what I'm trying to do is force myself to get out, you know, go                    |
| 23:22      | work at Starbucks, be one of those guys that, you know, hey, I'm going to go sit in the                   |
| 23:25      | corner right at Starbucks, whatever, you know, it is what it is, like it's a way to get out               |
| 23:29      | of the house when you work at home and it gets a little frustrating.                                      |
| 23:32      | So I am, look, I'm going to get, and I'm so frustrated because I went to order it the                     |
| 23:37      | other day and it was sold out, but the Roomba J7, and I think this is one of the newer ones,              |
| 23:43      | but it's both a mop and a vacuum in one robot, which I'm very excited about because I don't               |
| 23:49      | want to do robots.                                                                                        |
| 23:50      | I want one robot.                                                                                         |
| 23:53      | And because the place I'm moving into, it's hardwood floors everywhere except the bedrooms.               |
| 24:02      | The bedrooms are carpet.                                                                                  |
| 24:03      | And for anyone that does audio, like that's like the perfect setup because you don't want                 |
| 24:07      | hardwood floors in a place you record audio because you get a whole bunch of echo and                     |
| 24:11      | stuff like that.                                                                                          |
| 24:12      | So this is like the perfect robot for my place, but it's sold out.                                        |
| 24:17      | I was just like, no.                                                                                      |
| 24:18      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 24:19      | Would you like an alternative suggestion, Chris?                                                          |
| 24:21      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 24:22      | Okay, the dueling robots, okay.                                                                           |
| 24:24      | They were friends.                                                                                        |
| 24:25      | It was a buttercup and, oh gosh, Wesley, Wesley, sorry, I've had a moment where I forgot my               |
| 24:32      | princess bride references, but yeah, buttercup and Wesley, so the vacuum and the mop.                     |
| 24:39      | And they were great.                                                                                      |
| 24:40      | The mop was not particularly smart.                                                                       |
| 24:42      | It was like a, you fill it, you stick it on the ground, you press the go button, it goes,                 |
| 24:46      | and that beeps at you when it's done.                                                                     |
| 24:48      | It was fine.                                                                                              |
| 24:49      | I only have two tiled floors in my place, my kitchen and my bathroom, but I got something                 |
| 24:55      | a little different, which is I got the Omni or the ECOVACS D-Bot Omni-X1 Turbo.                            |
| 25:03      | That is a name.                                                                                           |
| 25:04      | It is a heck of a name.                                                                                   |
| 25:08      | The difference between the Omni ones versus a lot of the others is it will not go on to                   |
| 25:13      | carpet when the mop is attached.                                                                          |
| 25:15      | And so a lot of these ones, they'll pick up their mop and then go on to the carpet.                       |
| 25:21      | And 99 times out of 100, probably 199 times out of 200 or even higher than that.                          |
| 25:28      | That works perfectly.                                                                                     |
| 25:29      | The problem is is when it doesn't work perfectly and then it kind of like drags dirty mop heads           |
| 25:34      | and water all over your carpet.                                                                           |
| 25:38      | And because my place is mostly carpet, I was not okay with that possibility.                              |
| 25:43      | So I went with the Omni option because what it has is it's got little magnetic mop heads                  |
| 25:49      | on it.                                                                                                    |
| 25:50      | And so what you do is you just say, okay, Eco, come here.                                                 |
| 25:54      | And then Eco's listening.                                                                                 |
| 25:55      | It's got a little voice assistant built into it.                                                          |
| 25:57      | It's not great, but it works for, okay, Eco, come here.                                                   |
| 26:00      | And so it pops out of his little garage and goes over to you and then you just lift up                    |
| 26:04      | the back and put your fingers on the mop heads to push them down and then they push down                  |
| 26:08      | onto the floor and you take them away and then say, okay, Eco, go home and that's it.                     |
| 26:14      | And then the next time it cleans, it will just vacuum because obviously the mop heads                     |
| 26:20      | aren't attached.                                                                                          |
| 26:21      | It detects automatically whether or not the mop heads are attached.                                       |
| 26:23      | And when the mop heads are attached, even if you tell it, like, go clean the bedroom,                     |
| 26:27      | in your case, Christopher, because that's the one that's got carpet, it'll get to the                     |
| 26:31      | bedroom and be like, no, I can't do that.                                                                 |
| 26:33      | Sorry, mop's attached and just turn it all on home, which is quite cool.                                  |
| 26:37      | So that's certainly something to consider for folks like me who have pale cream carpets                   |
| 26:42      | in their house and don't want to risk dirty mop water and stuff getting everywhere.                       |
| 26:47      | For me, I'm really enjoying the robot.                                                                    |
| 26:50      | It does the auto emptying of the bin.                                                                     |
| 26:52      | It washes its own mop heads and cleans them and dries them.                                               |
| 26:55      | It's got a little blow dryer in it for the mop heads.                                                     |
| 26:57      | So cute.                                                                                                  |
| 27:00      | And yeah, it's great.                                                                                     |
| 27:02      | I love it.                                                                                                |
| 27:03      | It also has shortcut support.                                                                             |
| 27:05      | So what I do is when I leave the house, so this is Buttercup 2.0.                                         |
| 27:14      | So when Buttercup 2.0 runs, I just update something in [[Home Assistant]] and say, hey,                       |
| 27:19      | Buttercup ran.                                                                                            |
| 27:20      | And so that I know that, you know, Buttercup's clean today.                                               |
| 27:23      | But when I leave the house, [[Home Assistant]] knows I've left the house and it can check                     |
| 27:27      | my calendar.                                                                                              |
| 27:28      | So if I just run to the shop that's down the road, then it's probably not going to, well,                 |
| 27:32      | it won't check because I've told it, like, if I just go to supermarket, doh check.                        |
| 27:36      | But if I go to say my belly class, it'll go, hey, did we run today?                                       |
| 27:40      | Oh, no, we haven't run today.                                                                             |
| 27:42      | Okay, we're going to clean.                                                                               |
| 27:44      | And then it just goes off and it cleans automatically based on the fact that I've left home.              |
| 27:48      | And so it just does it.                                                                                   |
| 27:50      | And it just calls my push call automation service like, hey, Buttercup 2.0, go clean.                     |
| 27:54      | And Buttercup 2.0 goes and cleans and that's it, works perfectly.                                         |
| 27:57      | So something to consider, something with shortcut support, either way, might be a really good             |
| 28:02      | way to work around making sure that, you know, your robot vacuum runs when you're not home.               |
| 28:08      | So yeah, that's, that's something to consider.                                                            |
| 28:11      | Fantastic.                                                                                                |
| 28:12      | Yeah, I will definitely look at that because that's, that's exactly what I want.                          |
| 28:15      | I was always, you know, I was, I was kind of in the Roomba camp because they had that                     |
| 28:19      | auto detect feature, but you know, it's not home kit nor shortcut.                                        |
| 28:23      | I don't think Roomba's have shortcut support.                                                             |
| 28:26      | Mine doesn't at least.                                                                                    |
| 28:28      | I don't have a Roomba's check.                                                                            |
| 28:29      | So maybe, maybe somebody listening to the show can write in or if you tweet to post                       |
| 28:34      | about it, then I'll, I'll reshare it.                                                                     |
| 28:36      | So you may get some, some answers before you move as to whether or not it has it, or maybe                |
| 28:41      | somebody can hook you up with a Roomba.                                                                   |
| 28:43      | They find one that's in stock somewhere.                                                                  |
| 28:44      | So you can get it and always return it, perhaps if it doesn't have shortcut support, because              |
| 28:48      | I know different models may or may not have the, the support.                                             |
| 28:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 28:53      | But yeah, as it is, I'm finding that the shortcut support, like, it's not amazing                         |
| 28:59      | shortcut support, to be honest, like it's just a couple of actions, but it works.                         |
| 29:02      | And that's, that's all I care about.                                                                      |
| 29:05      | But I mean, that's the thing that, that I would care about is making sure it runs when                    |
| 29:09      | I'm not home because I don't, I don't know about you guys, but like my Roomba that I                      |
| 29:12      | have now, it's not one of the smart ones.                                                                 |
| 29:14      | It's not, it's not particularly fancy at all, but it's so loud.                                           |
| 29:20      | Even if I have noise canceling headphones on, I can still hear it.                                        |
| 29:23      | So I don't like it to run when I'm at home because I have ADHD and I get distracted very                  |
| 29:30      | easily.                                                                                                   |
| 29:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 29:32      | And there, there is nothing worse than watching a robot do a task that you do not want to                 |
| 29:36      | do by hand and going, I could do this better than you.                                                    |
| 29:39      | Why are you being so silly at doing this?                                                                 |
| 29:41      | Why are you going around in circles?                                                                      |
| 29:42      | It doesn't make sense.                                                                                    |
| 29:43      | Why did you miss that piece of fluff on the floor?                                                        |
| 29:44      | Pick up the fluff.                                                                                        |
| 29:45      | And before you know it, you're standing over the robot trying to make it do the thing instead             |
| 29:49      | of doing what you're supposed to be doing.                                                                |
| 29:51      | So yeah, I actually, what I do is I have a meeting every morning from 9.45 until 10.                      |
| 29:59      | So at 9.50 buttercup cleans the kitchen.                                                                  |
| 30:02      | So whatever happens in the day, like the kitchen gets cleaned, it's diagonally the other side             |
| 30:07      | of my apartment to where I am.                                                                            |
| 30:09      | And the kitchen door is usually shut partially for heat reasons because that room doesn't                 |
| 30:13      | have heating, partially for noise reasons because buttercup plus washing machine, dishwasher,             |
| 30:17      | tumble dryer, et cetera, are all in that room.                                                            |
| 30:20      | And so at the very least, like my kitchen floor gets cleaned on a daily basis, which                      |
| 30:23      | is great because it has like mapping and area cleaning and all of that built into it.                     |
| 30:29      | So yeah, it's nice to make sure that at least one floor is cleaned every day and then it'll               |
| 30:34      | go and like clean the whole house when I actually go out, which is great.                                 |
| 30:40      | So I've got a couple points to add here.                                                                  |
| 30:42      | Number one is if you're interested in automation and you haven't tried a robot vacuum, you                |
| 30:47      | should.                                                                                                   |
| 30:48      | Oh yeah, the ones we're talking about are kind of the high-end ones.                                      |
| 30:51      | You can like, you know, Chris is looking more for one.                                                    |
| 30:53      | You can make some really good ones as well, which are the lower end of the price range,                   |
| 30:57      | especially when they're on sale.                                                                          |
| 30:59      | Definitely worth looking at.                                                                              |
| 31:00      | I had a eufy one before and the only reason why I upgraded was I got a really good deal                   |
| 31:03      | on the ECOVACS.                                                                                            |
| 31:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 31:05      | So what I was saying is you can get one fairly inexpensive, so look for them.                             |
| 31:10      | And secondly, the clear name for a robot vacuum is not buttercup, it's Moe.                               |
| 31:16      | You have to name your robot vac after the little cleaning robot from WALL-E.                              |
| 31:20      | I mean, let's just all agree.                                                                             |
| 31:23      | He's more of a mop than a vacuum and I mostly need vacuuming, hence why I went for buttercup              |
| 31:29      | because I thought it was time that she actually did some of the work.                                     |
| 31:32      | But I do respect Moe as a good name choice.                                                               |
| 31:35      | My parents named theirs Rosie after the Jetsons.                                                          |
| 31:39      | My current one is R2 because I'm a big Star Wars nerd, but yeah, you know, there's good                   |
| 31:45      | names out there.                                                                                          |
| 31:46      | I think you have to name one.                                                                             |
| 31:47      | I think you do have to.                                                                                   |
| 31:48      | Oh, you do.                                                                                               |
| 31:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 31:50      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 31:51      | There's actually like a naming place in the ECOVACS app.                                                   |
| 31:53      | I'm pretty certain there was one in the eufy app as well.                                                 |
| 31:56      | If folks want to chime in in the forums and let us know whether or not you can name your                  |
| 32:00      | robot mobs and vacuums in their app or if you have to resort to like putting a label                      |
| 32:04      | on them with Sharpie or something to name them, please do let us know.                                    |
| 32:08      | This is essential feedback.                                                                               |
| 32:09      | Also, what is the name of your robot assistant if you have one or what would it be if you                 |
| 32:13      | don't have one?                                                                                           |
| 32:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 32:15      | I've got an ageing Roomba, but home assistant recognises it.                                               |
| 32:19      | So I've got enough automation and mine is just a vacuum.                                                  |
| 32:23      | I do have a separate little mop that Rose convinced me to buy and I put that out in                       |
| 32:28      | a couple of rooms where we've got just the wood floors only, but I find actually to clean                 |
| 32:32      | the wood floors, I actually have to do it myself.                                                         |
| 32:35      | They, you know, the robot vac isn't that great.                                                           |
| 32:39      | But the vacuuming part is amazing and nine times out of 10, the way I activate is I go                    |
| 32:45      | over and I push the button and I walk out of the room and close the door and that's                       |
| 32:48      | good enough.                                                                                              |
| 32:49      | So, you know, as much as I like automation, some of this stuff is pretty easy, but the                    |
| 32:55      | real automation piece of this is not necessarily triggering it, but it's to be in the other               |
| 33:00      | room doing something else while your floor is getting vacuumed.                                           |
| 33:03      | And these things are a lot better than they used to be, you know, even the cheaper ones.                  |
| 33:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 33:09      | They're both a lot better than they used to be.                                                           |
| 33:11      | And also, they're not supposed to be as good as like your gigantic humongous vacuum because               |
| 33:16      | they're supposed to run every day and you're not supposed to drag out your gigantic humongous             |
| 33:20      | vacuum every day.                                                                                         |
| 33:21      | You're supposed to do it like once a week or in some cases once a month or whatever,                      |
| 33:25      | whatever is needed for where you live.                                                                    |
| 33:27      | But the robot vacuum can run multiple times a day if needed because it won't get tired                    |
| 33:33      | and want to go on strike unless it goes back on the docking correctly and doesn't charge,                 |
| 33:37      | which hasn't happened to me with the ECOVACS, happened to me occasionally with the Eufy,                   |
| 33:43      | though I think the cat I was fostering for a while may have been responsible for some                     |
| 33:46      | of that.                                                                                                  |
| 33:47      | So, if you have pets, make sure that the robot has poop detection as a side note or check                 |
| 33:52      | for poop before you run it just in case you don't want poop to get in, that's a thing                     |
| 33:56      | that you want to avoid.                                                                                   |
| 33:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 33:58      | I actually acclimated my dog when she was a little puppy to the...                                        |
| 34:01      | I started running the vacuum the day she arrived.                                                         |
| 34:05      | And now to her, it's just another stupid thing that I do and she could care less about it.                |
| 34:12      | So does your robot vacuum David send you a map when it's done cleaning?                                   |
| 34:19      | Because I saw...                                                                                          |
| 34:20      | It could, but I don't pay any attention to it, yeah.                                                      |
| 34:22      | Well, I saw something ages ago, so I'm not going to be able to find it now, where somebody's              |
| 34:27      | dog was so not bothered by the vacuum that every day when the vacuum finished, it would                   |
| 34:32      | send them a little map and they would be able to tell where their dog was sleeping because                |
| 34:37      | it would just be like sleeping in the middle of the floor and there would be like a dog                   |
| 34:40      | outline where the robot just couldn't clean it, would like go up to the dog and then like                 |
| 34:44      | reverse back and then go up to it again and reverse back and like work its way around                     |
| 34:48      | the dog.                                                                                                  |
| 34:49      | So there'd be like this dog hole somewhere in the kitchen or the living room every time                   |
| 34:53      | they vacuumed.                                                                                            |
| 34:54      | And I just thought that was brilliant and adorable.                                                       |
| 34:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 34:57      | That is adorable.                                                                                         |
| 34:58      | Well, Robot Vacs thumbs up from all the automators.                                                        |
| 35:01      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 35:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 35:03      | What about lights and switches?                                                                           |
| 35:04      | I mean, you said you said you're going to keep your light bulbs, your smart light bulbs.                  |
| 35:10      | Now that you've got space, I would recommend looking into Lutron, I mean, it's such a game                |
| 35:15      | changer for home automation.                                                                              |
| 35:17      | Can you use those in combination of smart bulbs or do you have to buy like special ones                   |
| 35:21      | to use with smart bulbs?                                                                                  |
| 35:22      | Because I know that you release like a module that you can put into the wall if you've got                |
| 35:26      | space in the wall, which we don't hear in the UK usually, so that like the regular light                  |
| 35:29      | switch works, but like if your smart light switch kills power to the smart bulb, then                     |
| 35:35      | you're going to continually be told like, hey, a bunch of devices aren't responding                       |
| 35:38      | in HomeKit, which is just annoying.                                                                       |
| 35:42      | So for me, I think what I want to do is I want to do both, but I'm kind of waiting until                  |
| 35:50      | I get in there to kind of see which light switches control which outlets because that's                   |
| 35:55      | the big kicker for me.                                                                                    |
| 35:57      | I think like if you like you were saying Rose, like if you turn off a light switch and the                |
| 36:03      | smart bulbs is connected to that, you're going to have a whole bunch of error issues.                     |
| 36:07      | But what I would ultimately love to be all in on Lutron Caseta, I've heard nothing but                    |
| 36:13      | good things from all the podcasters, all the friends, everyone that's gone in on it.                      |
| 36:18      | I've never heard anyone say anything bad about it, it is a little pricey to get in and stuff              |
| 36:23      | like that, which, you know, all this stuff adds up, but the nice thing is it's just once                  |
| 36:30      | it's in, it's there and it's reliable.                                                                    |
| 36:34      | So I think for now, I ordered a couple extra hue bulbs just so I could get up and running,                |
| 36:40      | but I am kind of waiting to see how all the matter stuff shakes out because not only do                   |
| 36:44      | I want to go in for Lutron Caseta for the lights, but I also want to go in with Lutron                    |
| 36:49      | Caseta for the blinds as well, like I want to, the place that I'm moving into just has                    |
| 36:55      | dumb pole blinds, you know, the metal blinds that you see in most American homes.                         |
| 37:01      | I don't know, you know, outside of America what they are, but American homes are like                     |
| 37:05      | fabric blinds over here.                                                                                  |
| 37:06      | You can get them in different colours, you buy them in IKEA and you can get the smart                      |
| 37:10      | ones from IKEA as well.                                                                                   |
| 37:11      | So I have smart IKEA blinds, they work super well, I have to say, and you can also just                   |
| 37:16      | buy a car or controllers for blinds, which like go onto the chain of blind.                               |
| 37:20      | So if there's somewhere where you can't get like a blind, a smart blind to fit that space,                |
| 37:24      | but you can get a blind that you like the look of, then you could always just add a                       |
| 37:27      | smart controller to that, to work around it, not being so smart.                                          |
| 37:32      | I also, by the way, just to backtrack a little bit, just found if you don't go in on Lutron               |
| 37:36      | Caseta, you go in on Lutron Aurora, those control smart bulbs, they are smart bulb dimmers.               |
| 37:42      | And I'll put a link to those in the show notes for folks so that you can have a look at them.             |
| 37:47      | Because I knew that Lutron did something for smart bulbs, and so I've just found it on                    |
| 37:52      | their website, which is, I think, useful to know because, yeah, if you want, if you want                  |
| 37:58      | like things like changing white colours or changing colours, then you're going to want                      |
| 38:04      | a smart bulb, but you don't want to be killing the power to those.                                        |
| 38:08      | So.                                                                                                       |
| 38:09      | Yeah, see, I don't, I don't do the light bulbs that change colours.                                        |
| 38:13      | I, okay, I might be the only YouTuber on the planet that doesn't like LED lights.                         |
| 38:19      | I don't know what it is, but like the constant changing LED light, maybe it's my ADHD.                    |
| 38:25      | I find it very distracting.                                                                               |
| 38:27      | See, I just set a static, like I have three lights behind me that are colour, which I set                  |
| 38:32      | statically before the start of a show.                                                                    |
| 38:34      | And then I have a white adaptive overhead bulb, so it will change from like a cool blue                   |
| 38:40      | light in the morning to a warm yellow light in the evening.                                               |
| 38:43      | Those are what I have.                                                                                    |
| 38:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 38:45      | And that, that works well for me because I can actually see like the problem sometimes,                   |
| 38:50      | the problem with a lot of the colour bulbs is if you open them up, you'll see there's                      |
| 38:53      | like five RGB LEDs in there and 10 white ones.                                                            |
| 38:58      | So if you set it to like bright red, that bright red is not going to be bright because                    |
| 39:03      | it's only got five LEDs and they're red.                                                                  |
| 39:06      | Whereas if you set it to white, then it'll be twice as bright because there's white                       |
| 39:09      | and also it's, it appears lighter because it's a white colour instead of a red colour.                      |
| 39:14      | So yeah, so I've gone, aside from one room where I already had a colour bulb, which was                    |
| 39:19      | previously in a lamp, I have just got a white adaptive hue bulbs in my lights primarily.                  |
| 39:27      | I've got like some hue, I've got a hue go, hue iris and some light strips for colours,                     |
| 39:32      | which just get set like at the start of the day.                                                          |
| 39:35      | And that's it.                                                                                            |
| 39:36      | David, I know you were doing things with your lighting colours to indicate like different                  |
| 39:41      | things that you were doing at different times.                                                            |
| 39:42      | So as you switch from doing this thing to that thing, you were, you were looking into                     |
| 39:46      | setting colour scenes as kind of like a visual prompt for yourself.                                        |
| 39:50      | Exactly.                                                                                                  |
| 39:51      | I've got a hue strip on the back of my desk and it's like, it's like a notification system.               |
| 39:55      | Like if the doors are unlocked or if I'm changing focus modes and things like that.                       |
| 40:01      | And yeah, I haven't got it completely wired in there.                                                     |
| 40:04      | I'm using primarily for hue lights because they're so good at colour changing and most                     |
| 40:09      | of the lights I have don't do colour change because I'm cheap and I don't really need                      |
| 40:13      | it, you know, but the, but I've got a couple of hue little spotlights on.                                 |
| 40:19      | I've got like a workbench in my studio.                                                                   |
| 40:21      | I call it the iron giant, but it's like, you know, if you go to a home centre and you                     |
| 40:26      | get a big metal thing with metal drawers, that's what it, it's one of those things.                       |
| 40:30      | But I put them in the back of it.                                                                         |
| 40:32      | So it back lights anything I put on top of it.                                                            |
| 40:35      | And then I have a strip light on the back of my desk and, and that's addressable with                     |
| 40:40      | with shortcuts.                                                                                           |
| 40:41      | And you know, once you get shortcuts, any, you know, the world is your oyster.                            |
| 40:44      | And so I've been playing with doing stuff like that.                                                      |
| 40:48      | And it's kind of fun.                                                                                     |
| 40:49      | Like, you know, like I said, is the door unlocked or is, you know, like switching to like serious         |
| 40:55      | focus mode, changing colours and things like that.                                                         |
| 40:59      | It's just other ways to rewire my brain to get work done.                                                 |
| 41:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 41:04      | That makes a lot of sense.                                                                                |
| 41:05      | And I've been doing something similar as well.                                                            |
| 41:07      | I've recently got a Zigbee RGB LED strip is actually RGB, CCT, FCOB, because all of the                   |
| 41:17      | acronyms are needed.                                                                                      |
| 41:18      | So RGB, red, green, blue, CCT, colour changing temperature, FCOB, flexible, something or                   |
| 41:26      | other, obviously, the CAB, it's the one where the LEDs are so close together in the, in the               |
| 41:32      | strip that you can't actually see the individual bulbs, basically.                                        |
| 41:37      | And so I got one of those, and it's addressable, it's called addressable sections.                        |
| 41:42      | And I've stuck that up over my bed.                                                                       |
| 41:44      | So I have like a cupboards that are fixed to the wall, which go over the head of my                       |
| 41:49      | bed.                                                                                                      |
| 41:50      | And there's like a little lip that hangs down.                                                            |
| 41:51      | So I've stuck these lights to the lip where it's kind of pointing back at the wall.                       |
| 41:56      | So they're not shining directly down on my face, but like they're reflecting off of the,                  |
| 42:02      | the cupboards that hang over head, which are slightly shiny, they're not entirely matte.                  |
| 42:08      | And what that does now in the morning is before my alarm goes off, this starts red and it                 |
| 42:12      | transitions through orange, yellow, warm white.                                                           |
| 42:16      | And then when my alarm goes off, then it starts going into cool white over the next five minutes          |
| 42:22      | or so to help me wake up in the morning.                                                                  |
| 42:24      | And that has been working incredibly well.                                                                |
| 42:25      | It's not like an actual sad light for seasonal affective disorder or anything like that.                  |
| 42:33      | But you know what?                                                                                        |
| 42:34      | Having a fake sunset above my head for like half an hour in the morning is definitely working             |
| 42:38      | for me and it's helping me get up.                                                                        |
| 42:41      | So yeah, it's also pretty darn bright.                                                                    |
| 42:43      | So it might just be the brightness.                                                                       |
| 42:45      | I may find at some point that I've started sleeping with my head under the covers.                        |
| 42:49      | If that happens, I'll have to report back.                                                                |
| 42:51      | But as it is, you know, I've got colours in that sort of thing.                                            |
| 42:56      | But other than that, I'm just using, you know, cool to warm white adaptive bulbs in other                 |
| 43:00      | places and I'm just using an adaptive lighting integration in [[Home Assistant]] to automatically             |
| 43:06      | adapt colour and or brightness in some cases, just so that, you know, like my hallway lights               |
| 43:14      | will automatically adapt to be really dim at night.                                                       |
| 43:17      | So if I get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light doesn't turn                   |
| 43:20      | on like cold white at two o'clock in the morning to 100% waking you up.                                   |
| 43:24      | It's on like a nice warm white that's quite dim.                                                          |
| 43:27      | So you can see where you're going, but it doesn't really wake you up.                                     |
| 43:30      | My last bit of home kit intervention for you here is I think you should consider smart                    |
| 43:36      | locks.                                                                                                    |
| 43:37      | You know, I know it's not on your list, but there, this is something I finally put the                    |
| 43:42      | bullet on two or three years ago, and it's just so convenient.                                            |
| 43:46      | Like, I mean, we don't get much rain here, but yesterday we had a pretty good rainstorm                   |
| 43:50      | and I got home and I've got all the stuff in the car, the groceries, whatnot, I got                       |
| 43:54      | to get in the house and just sit in the car and just unlock the door with your phone and                  |
| 43:59      | then be able to just, you know, bolt in.                                                                  |
| 44:02      | It's just so convenient.                                                                                  |
| 44:03      | So if you get one with home kit integration and you turn on Siri suggestions in CarPlay,                  |
| 44:11      | then when you're at home, if you look at the bottom corner closest to the driver's seat                   |
| 44:17      | of CarPlay, you may see like a little icon that's like eight squares, or you may see                      |
| 44:24      | one with a left angle, a rectangle on the left vertically and then four squares on the                    |
| 44:29      | right.                                                                                                    |
| 44:30      | Either way, if you, if you tap the eight squares twice or you just tap the rectangle                      |
| 44:35      | on the four squares once, then that will take you like to the CarPlay home screen with like               |
| 44:39      | map directions and so on.                                                                                 |
| 44:42      | And if you've got Siri suggestions enabled and you have a home kit garage there, and                      |
| 44:47      | I know Chris, you're looking to garages, then you can unlock that.                                        |
| 44:51      | Now what I've done, I don't have a garage, but I have a garage and home kit, or at least                  |
| 44:56      | home kit things I do, because what I did in [[Home Assistant]] is just say, hey, can we pretend               |
| 45:00      | that my patio locks our garage please and send that over to home kit.                                     |
| 45:06      | And so now when it's raining, I can just tap it on my CarPlay dashboard, get out of the                   |
| 45:10      | car and bolt straight into the house without actually having to, you know, pause and get                  |
| 45:14      | soggy and wet, which is perfect.                                                                          |
| 45:16      | So if you're actually getting garage, Chris, I know you're looking at the Merrill Smart                   |
| 45:20      | garage door opener.                                                                                       |
| 45:22      | And I've heard from various people that aside from some brief blips due to some exceptionally             |
| 45:27      | cold weather in Memphis recently, that it's been working really well for them, then yeah,                 |
| 45:34      | you can, you know, unlocking your garage slash door from CarPlay is amazing.                              |
| 45:40      | Definitely recommended.                                                                                   |
| 45:41      | Or home key.                                                                                              |
| 45:42      | Look into home key options and then you can just tap your wrist on the on the lock and                    |
| 45:45      | open it.                                                                                                  |
| 45:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 45:47      | So for me, the way this house is laid out, that the garage is right in the front.                         |
| 45:53      | So like I'll probably always come in and out of the garage when like, you know, unloading                 |
| 45:57      | groceries and stuff like that.                                                                            |
| 45:59      | So garage, like a smart garage door opener, the Meross, I don't know how to pronounce it.                  |
| 46:04      | But that one is kind of like at the top of my to-do list.                                                 |
| 46:08      | It should be here tomorrow, but I can't install it until next week.                                       |
| 46:13      | I don't expect to have any issues with the cold because I am in Fresno, California.                       |
| 46:17      | It does not get cold here.                                                                                |
| 46:19      | It gets extremely hot here.                                                                               |
| 46:20      | So we'll see what it can handle as far as the heat side.                                                  |
| 46:26      | Like in the summer, I'm not even joking.                                                                  |
| 46:28      | It'll get to like 110 degrees Fahrenheit here.                                                            |
| 46:30      | Like it's no joke.                                                                                        |
| 46:33      | So we'll see how that handles in the heat.                                                                |
| 46:35      | But I will probably like, I have smart locks on like to, you know, the to-do list.                        |
| 46:40      | It's not necessarily at the top of my like, Hey, these are the things I need to do within                 |
| 46:44      | the first week of moving in.                                                                              |
| 46:46      | But it's on my list of things I want to look into because yeah, especially one with the                   |
| 46:52      | the home key, the one where you could just use like your Apple watch to unlock the door.                  |
| 46:55      | That would be very, very convenient.                                                                      |
| 46:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 46:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 47:00      | I wish my locks supported that.                                                                           |
| 47:01      | Unfortunately, they don't.                                                                                |
| 47:02      | I have Yale smart locks and over here in the UK, they don't have a home key support at                    |
| 47:09      | least yet.                                                                                                |
| 47:10      | And then I would have to switch the modules out.                                                          |
| 47:12      | And I've currently just got Z-Wave modules in, which I just shared to [[Home Assistant]]                      |
| 47:16      | and then shared it back into HomeKit.                                                                     |
| 47:18      | That was my first use of HomeKit actually, just it's cheaper to buy the Z-Wave modules                    |
| 47:23      | by a lot over here than the Control 4, which is a Zigbee.                                                 |
| 47:29      | And I didn't know how to get stuff into HomeKit in any other way at the time.                             |
| 47:34      | So I just went with [[Home Assistant]] and one large rabbit hole later, having foam automating                |
| 47:39      | things.                                                                                                   |
| 47:40      | But yeah, I think, I think the garage door opener for you Chris sounds like it's going                    |
| 47:43      | to be a very good pick there.                                                                             |
| 47:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 47:46      | I'm very excited about that.                                                                              |
| 47:48      | The one thing that I am kind of bummed about, but maybe it's a good thing is the Meross one                |
| 47:52      | isn't one of the ones that works with Amazon that like the Amazon delivery people can just                |
| 47:57      | open up the door, slide your package in and close it.                                                     |
| 48:00      | My brother has one of those and he absolutely loves that because he doesn't have to like                  |
| 48:04      | worry about like being home for an important package delivery or something like that.                     |
| 48:08      | Well, you can always look into that eufy package box that they brought out for things                   |
| 48:13      | like that.                                                                                                |
| 48:14      | Oh, okay.                                                                                                 |
| 48:15      | I think it was eufy that brought out the package box.                                                   |
| 48:17      | Somebody brought out like a smart package delivery box.                                                   |
| 48:20      | I'll see if I can find a link for the show notes.                                                         |

| 48:42      | things that will help you take it to the next level.                                                      |
| 48:45      | But this can be hard when your attention is pulled in different directions because that's                 |
| 48:49      | the reality of being a boss and moreover, you are a technical boss.                                       |
| 48:53      | You're listening to the automators, you know how to deal with basic IT stuff.                             |
| 48:57      | So why don't you do it?                                                                                   |
| 48:58      | Well, the reason you shouldn't do it is because you need to be building your business and                 |
| 49:02      | not being the IT person.                                                                                  |

| 49:37      | There's a time to be a geek and there's a time to delegate and when it comes to your                      |
| 49:40      | business delegation is how you survive.                                                                   |

| 50:24      | So Chris, one of the things that you mentioned is, since you've last been on the show, you                |
| 50:28      | haven't abandoned the iPad.                                                                               |
| 50:29      | It's all right, folks.                                                                                    |
| 50:30      | We're going to talk about that in Automator's Macs, how Chris's got fixed the iPad.                       |
| 50:34      | But you're using the Mac a lot more.                                                                      |
| 50:38      | What does that look like?                                                                                 |
| 50:39      | How has that changed things for you?                                                                      |
| 50:41      | Not necessarily just automation-wise, but what does that look like, big picture?                          |
| 50:46      | So I think the last time I was on, I had just bought a new MacBook Pro.                                   |
| 50:51      | And it's one of the M1 Macs.                                                                              |
| 50:53      | I went full ham, M1 Macs, 64 gigs of RAM, four terabytes of storage.                                      |
| 51:00      | I just went all out on this machine.                                                                      |
| 51:04      | And before that, for five years, four or five years, something like that, timelines.                      |
| 51:10      | Time doesn't make sense to me anymore.                                                                    |
| 51:13      | I was editing and doing all of my work right from the iPad.                                               |
| 51:17      | And when I say editing, I mean editing videos, editing photos, or, did I say Mac?                         |
| 51:21      | iPad.                                                                                                     |
| 51:22      | I meant iPad.                                                                                             |
| 51:23      | My brain is gone.                                                                                         |
| 51:24      | I'm sorry.                                                                                                |
| 51:25      | That's okay.                                                                                              |
| 51:26      | For four or five years, I was doing all my work on the iPad.                                              |
| 51:29      | I was editing video, I was editing photos, I was doing all my work right from the iPad.                   |
| 51:35      | But the app that I was using for editing video, it got really buggy.                                      |
| 51:39      | It got to the point where I wasn't able to export video, which is a problem when you                      |
| 51:44      | make videos for a living for an income.                                                                   |
| 51:48      | So I ended up having to get a Mac at the time.                                                            |
| 51:50      | And when I got it, I was like, okay, I'm just going to use this for video editing.                        |
| 51:54      | I love the iPad.                                                                                          |
| 51:56      | The iPad has been like my baby.                                                                           |
| 51:59      | I just absolutely love working for it.                                                                    |
| 52:02      | And over the course of this last year, I've just been slowly using the Mac more and more.                 |
| 52:08      | And I would honestly say I'm about 50-50 split between the Mac and the iPad now.                          |
| 52:12      | And we'll talk about why, and Automator's Macs go to the URL to get that.                                 |
| 52:20      | But yeah, so I've been doing a lot with shortcuts on the Mac.                                             |
| 52:24      | And there's a few key differences between shortcuts on the Mac.                                           |
| 52:28      | And I know you guys have talked about that.                                                               |
| 52:30      | But the one that I absolutely love is quick action menus, especially like in Finder.                      |
| 52:36      | That is so nice.                                                                                          |
| 52:38      | So I have a shortcut that converts any image to a proper thumbnail size for YouTube.                      |
| 52:47      | YouTube can be a little particular when it comes to like wanting a, like it wants a proper                |
| 52:53      | file size.                                                                                                |
| 52:54      | It wants a 16 by 9 image.                                                                                 |
| 52:57      | So this shortcut does all of that for me.                                                                 |
| 52:59      | And I can just right click on an image and run this from the quick action menu, which                     |
| 53:04      | it just spits out a duplicate of that version in the proper file size and the proper resolution           |
| 53:11      | and all that stuff.                                                                                       |
| 53:13      | And that's something that's just not on the iPad.                                                         |
| 53:15      | And it's a bummer that it's not there because it's just super convenient.                                 |
| 53:18      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 53:19      | You have to go through the share sheet on the iPad.                                                       |
| 53:21      | And I think this is one of the places where the differences between the Mac and the iPad                  |
| 53:27      | really show because the Mac has the quick action menu.                                                    |
| 53:31      | It's got services.                                                                                        |
| 53:33      | And then it's also now in Mac OS Ventura got share sheet for shortcuts, which it didn't                   |
| 53:38      | previously have just to confuse matters.                                                                  |
| 53:42      | And you know, I'm still using shareable for a bunch of things just because it's a great                   |
| 53:45      | app.                                                                                                      |
| 53:46      | But it's, as well, there's things where if you look in the different menus, things look                   |
| 53:50      | a little different.                                                                                       |
| 53:51      | So if you go, if you add a shortcut to the quick action menu, then you get it with like                   |
| 53:55      | an icon next to it.                                                                                       |
| 53:56      | And if it's in the services menu, you don't have any helpful icon and there's a bunch                     |
| 53:59      | of other stuff in there like revealing forklift if you're using forklift or run drop zone                 |
| 54:03      | action, if you quote drop zone or, you know, item, [[BBEdit]], all those things can show up                  |
| 54:08      | in there.                                                                                                 |
| 54:09      | They can add their own services.                                                                          |
| 54:11      | But the quick actions are more controllable in that they're in, well, you can control                     |
| 54:17      | both of them.                                                                                             |
| 54:18      | This is where it's confusing.                                                                             |
| 54:19      | But either way, you get like a bigger, bigger option.                                                     |
| 54:22      | And of course, you've also got the option to run things from the menu bar.                                |
| 54:26      | And now with Mac OS Ventura spotlight, have you been finding that you've been using things                |
| 54:30      | through spotlight or are you firmly on, I don't know, launch bar, click silver, [[Alfred]],                   |
| 54:35      | [[Raycast]], are you on one of those bandwagons?                                                              |
| 54:38      | I am all in on [[Raycast]].                                                                                   |
| 54:40      | So I was a big [[Alfred]] person for a very long time before I went all in on the iPad.                       |
| 54:49      | And then when I came back to the Mac, of course, I installed [[Alfred]].                                      |
| 54:52      | But then, you know, everyone started talking about [[Raycast]] and I was like, okay, I'll check               |
| 54:56      | this out.                                                                                                 |
| 54:57      | And it's nice.                                                                                            |
| 54:58      | And I love [[Raycast]].                                                                                       |
| 55:00      | The extension support that it has for third party apps is just, it's fantastic.                           |
| 55:06      | One of my favourite things is the extension, well, I got a couple, but one of them is the                  |
| 55:12      | ability to create a new to do for the app things.                                                         |
| 55:16      | I trigger that all day long.                                                                              |
| 55:18      | That's basically how I primarily add tasks, especially when I'm at my Mac or when I'm                     |
| 55:23      | at my Mac, really, because [[Raycast]] is only on the Mac.                                                    |
| 55:27      | That's how I add tasks into things.                                                                       |
| 55:30      | It's just so nice not to have to shift my context from whatever I am.                                     |
| 55:34      | So if I'm editing a video or editing photos or dealing with email or whatever, I don't                    |
| 55:40      | have to go into another app, you know, I hit command space, type new to do, you know, fill                |
| 55:45      | out the information, command enter, and it just sends it off to things.                                   |
| 55:49      | It's so nice.                                                                                             |
| 55:51      | But there's also an extension for [[Raycast]] for running shortcuts.                                          |
| 55:55      | And it's so good.                                                                                         |
| 55:57      | It's so fast.                                                                                             |
| 55:59      | I, it's, oh, it's so good.                                                                                |
| 56:01      | I love [[Raycast]].                                                                                           |
| 56:03      | I, I've been saying I need to make a video about it for a while and eventually I will                     |
| 56:06      | get around to it.                                                                                         |
| 56:07      | I've just been very busy.                                                                                 |
| 56:10      | But with [[Raycast]], that's basically how I trigger all of my shortcuts now.                                 |
| 56:14      | You know, I hit command space, type the shortcut name.                                                    |
| 56:18      | And what's really cool about [[Raycast]] is you can even pass input into the shortcut.                        |
| 56:22      | Now this isn't something I do a lot.                                                                      |
| 56:23      | I don't know about you guys.                                                                              |
| 56:24      | I don't, I don't have a ton of shortcuts that I can like, I have a couple, but most of them               |
| 56:32      | don't like pass input from like what I'm doing, like they just run in the background                      |
| 56:36      | or they like give me a menu and I pick from that kind of thing and do task based on that.                 |
| 56:42      | Yeah, I, so I have a lot of shortcuts that I pass input to because I run them as part                     |
| 56:47      | of another shortcut.                                                                                      |
| 56:48      | So for example, like if I'm getting together all of the apps that I'm going to talk about                 |
| 56:55      | on iOS today, I have one shortcut that goes off and it fetches the data from air table                    |
| 57:00      | and asks me, hey, like, what do you want to, like, which of these do you actually want                    |
| 57:04      | to get data for?                                                                                          |
| 57:05      | Cause I can end up planning some, some episodes like way out and I don't, when I'm quick,                 |
| 57:10      | trying to quickly plan for a show, I don't want to like be trying to cram everything                      |
| 57:13      | in, in, in that one, you know, little time spot.                                                          |
| 57:17      | So I'll, I'll just pick the ones that I need, but then it passes that off to another shortcut             |
| 57:23      | that if it doesn't get input, we'll then say, Hey, what app is it that you were looking                   |
| 57:27      | for information on place so that I can, you know, try and do something with this and then                 |
| 57:33      | create it.                                                                                                |
| 57:34      | But it, you know, it just gets iteratively passed each, each app that it needs to go                      |
| 57:39      | look for, which, you know, works really well for me.                                                      |
| 57:43      | But I tend not to end up passing shortcuts information from, I use [[Alfred]] and I've been                   |
| 57:49      | using [[Stephen Millard]] over [ThoughtAsylum's](https://thoughtasylum.com), excellent [[Alfred]] extensions.                                  |
| 57:53      | I tend not to really end up passing extra parameters in partially because I don't remember                |
| 57:59      | that that's a thing.                                                                                      |
| 58:00      | And also because my shortcuts are designed so that if they don't get given the data that                  |
| 58:04      | they need, then they ask for them.                                                                        |
| 58:07      | And this is one of the things that came about in, I think it was iOS 14, where they changed               |
| 58:12      | the sort of the, the share input so that you can say, Hey, if I'm asking for share input                  |
| 58:18      | and there isn't any, what do you want to do?                                                              |
| 58:21      | Do you want to stop and ask for something?                                                                |
| 58:23      | Do you want to continue?                                                                                  |
| 58:25      | Or do you want to stop and respond and just be like, no can do.                                           |
| 58:29      | Sorry.                                                                                                    |
| 58:30      | And I think there's another option as well.                                                               |
| 58:31      | But, you know, having that as an option makes it very, very simple to just, you know, run                 |
| 58:37      | my shortcuts as needed without providing the input, but it's nice to know that [[Raycast]]                    |
| 58:44      | has that support.                                                                                         |
| 58:45      | I know David, you've been playing with [[Raycast]] a bit.                                                     |
| 58:46      | Yeah, you know, I'm actually running them both.                                                           |
| 58:48      | I've got option space triggers, [[Raycast]] and command space triggers [[Alfred]] and there are,                  |
| 58:53      | there are better pieces for each of them, you know, like there's certain things that                      |
| 58:57      | one does better than the other.                                                                           |
| 58:59      | I will say on [[Raycast]] that the shortcuts launch is super fast.                                            |
| 59:04      | You don't have to type any modifier.                                                                      |
| 59:05      | You just type the shortcut and that's, that's really nice.                                                |
| 59:08      | There's some other really nice features in there, like, I don't know if you use [[SF Symbols]]                |
| 59:12      | at all, but their [[SF Symbols]] implementation is really good.                                               |
| 59:15      | You can search the library and grab a symbol very quickly, which I think is something I                   |
| 59:20      | use, use often.                                                                                           |
| 59:22      | I was just looking for Chris at one point I had running on [[Raycast]], but I don't see that                  |
| 59:26      | I have it anymore.                                                                                        |
| 59:27      | Well, actually the other thing for everybody is window management [[Raycast]] is really good.                 |
| 59:31      | I don't know if you've played with that Chris, but like setting a window size with [[Raycast]],               |
| 59:37      | like you, there's a, there's a window setting like saying called almost maximise, you know,               |
| 59:41      | and like it does a lot of really cool, like window sizing features that I think are fun.                  |
| 59:47      | But the one I wanted to point out to Chris is there's one where you can turn your cursor                  |
| 59:51      | into a lightsaber and I know you're a big Star Wars fan.                                                  |
| 59:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 59:55      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 59:56      | That's awesome.                                                                                           |
| 59:57      | It used to be there and I'm looking, I had it running it at one point and now I don't                     |
| 01:00:01   | see it.                                                                                                   |
| 01:00:02   | So,                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:03   | Was it like May the fourth that you did this on?                                                          |
| 01:00:06   | You know, I don't, I feel really dumb not seeing it because I had it, I thought I had                     |
| 01:00:10   | it installed, but you know, me and I was reinstalling and you know, because of what I do and I managed    |
| 01:00:15   | to, to nuke it at some point and I don't just don't see it.                                               |
| 01:00:19   | So I can't find it yet guys.                                                                              |
| 01:00:21   | This may be me going down a wild rabbit hole, but if I can find it between now and the time               |
| 01:00:25   | the show launches, I'll put a link, but that, that was a cool feature and it does the sound,              |
| 01:00:30   | you know, when you, when you send it off and, but I don't see it anywhere.                                |
| 01:00:34   | I'm searching their extension library for Saber and light and Star Wars.                                  |
| 01:00:38   | So maybe that.                                                                                            |
| 01:00:39   | Have you tried Saber with the correct and the incorrect spelling just to be sure.                         |
| 01:00:43   | Let me try one more thing.                                                                                |
| 01:00:46   | That's a pretty cool idea there.                                                                          |
| 01:00:48   | I can see like the sound might get annoying after a while, especially if you're somebody                  |
| 01:00:52   | that has to like plug in your Mac for a presentation or something like that, that might not be            |
| 01:00:56   | the best thing, but that would be so fun to play with.                                                    |
| 01:00:59   | You can, like using sound source is one of the things I love using sound source for,                      |
| 01:01:02   | especially now it's got shortcut support so that you can like properly integrate this                     |
| 01:01:05   | on the Mac is you can actually say like, Hey, I want to like mute my sound effects.                       |
| 01:01:13   | And so you can, you can just drag that down and you can send it to a different speaker                    |
| 01:01:17   | like a non-existent speaker if you wanted to, thanks to something like loop back.                         |
| 01:01:22   | And yeah, that's one of the things I do as a side note before I present things or make                    |
| 01:01:26   | a video is I've got a little shortcut that I run that like preps my screen and so on,                     |
| 01:01:32   | which I also use for screen sharing.                                                                      |
| 01:01:34   | And what are the things it does is it drags like the, or it sets the sound effects output                 |
| 01:01:38   | to like 10% and some speakers that are plugged in but are set to a reasonably quiet volume.               |
| 01:01:44   | I don't, I use them basically for this sort of thing and it makes sure that the sound                     |
| 01:01:48   | effects go to that.                                                                                       |
| 01:01:49   | So I'll still be aware of like somebody sent me a message or an emails come in or something               |
| 01:01:53   | if, you know, if I, if I need to be aware of things like that, and therefore there's                      |
| 01:01:57   | absolute left running, but it's, it's not going to the output that will get redirected                    |
| 01:02:02   | into whatever application I'm sharing with.                                                               |
| 01:02:04   | Yeah, that, that's really cool.                                                                           |
| 01:02:06   | I, I've kind of done something similar, but with device management, like I have a bunch                   |
| 01:02:11   | of shortcuts set up so that like when I'm doing a task, so especially like if I'm filming                 |
| 01:02:17   | a video, because I often film my devices.                                                                 |
| 01:02:20   | So I have a shortcut that will run and set like the proper brightness and do not disturb.                 |
| 01:02:25   | Cause I try and keep my videos looking very coherent.                                                     |
| 01:02:31   | That's probably the wrong word.                                                                           |
| 01:02:32   | Cohesive?                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:33   | Cohesive.                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:35   | Like I don't want notifications, like messages popping.                                                   |
| 01:02:36   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:37   | I don't, yeah, exactly.                                                                                   |
| 01:02:38   | Like I don't want messages popping in or like, you know, calendar appointments, like notifications        |
| 01:02:43   | showing up and stuff.                                                                                     |
| 01:02:44   | So like having shortcuts for like tasks that you do repeatedly that put your computers                    |
| 01:02:51   | into those proper states is really nice.                                                                  |
| 01:02:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:02:55   | Especially combined with focus modes now so that you can have a focus mode.                               |
| 01:02:58   | This is what I have for podcasting.                                                                       |
| 01:03:00   | I have a podcasting focus mode.                                                                           |
| 01:03:01   | I use the same one for audio and video, but it will just kill pretty much all notifications               |
| 01:03:05   | and it changes my lock screens as well so that I just have the things on the lock screens                 |
| 01:03:11   | I want to show.                                                                                           |
| 01:03:12   | So I basically just have widgets for the developer app and the tips app there, which                      |
| 01:03:19   | is the only reason why I have the tips app still installed because it occasionally pops                   |
| 01:03:22   | up something on screen.                                                                                   |
| 01:03:23   | I'll see it and go, oh, I can talk about that on iOS today.                                               |
| 01:03:25   | That's an interesting idea.                                                                               |
| 01:03:26   | But yeah, it's nice to, you know, be able to customise that.                                              |
| 01:03:32   | And I'm really glad that we actually have the option to do that now.                                      |
| 01:03:35   | I feel like I need to look into [[Raycast]].                                                                  |
| 01:03:37   | I've got my [[Alfred]] set up.                                                                                |
| 01:03:39   | Like it works perfectly for me.                                                                           |
| 01:03:41   | I've changed, I've slightly modified [[Stephen Millard\|Stephen Millard's]] script so that I actually don't                    |
| 01:03:48   | have to use a prefix for shortcuts.                                                                       |
| 01:03:50   | I can just have like my shortcuts appear, which works brilliantly for me.                                 |
| 01:03:56   | That was the biggest reason why I went to [[Raycast]] was because I didn't want to keep                       |
| 01:03:59   | typing SC and then the shortcut name.                                                                     |
| 01:04:02   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:03   | I didn't even think about like, I was like, oh, it's just now donning on me.                              |
| 01:04:06   | This is the Mac.                                                                                          |
| 01:04:07   | You can obviously modify things.                                                                          |
| 01:04:09   | I've been in the iPad world for so long that like, if something doesn't do something exactly              |
| 01:04:14   | right, like you can't, there's not a whole lot of modifying.                                              |
| 01:04:17   | So yeah, it's, but honestly, I just love [[Raycast]].                                                         |
| 01:04:22   | It's so fast.                                                                                             |
| 01:04:23   | It's so unbelievably fast that I don't see me going back to [[Alfred]].                                       |
| 01:04:30   | Fair enough.                                                                                              |
| 01:04:31   | I love [[Alfred]] and they've been adding some really cool features recently, which works                     |
| 01:04:35   | super well for me.                                                                                        |
| 01:04:36   | But one of the things I actually will do next is actually modify the shortcuts that appear                |
| 01:04:40   | so that if I don't type like SC at the start, then I will only get shortcuts that are in                  |
| 01:04:47   | folders because if the shortcuts are not in a folder, they're not organised and there's                   |
| 01:04:53   | a fairly good chance I'm going to have like untitled shortcut 274 or something showing                    |
| 01:04:58   | up, which is not what I need when I type shortcuts.                                                       |
| 01:05:00   | I'll probably won't like take control of shortcuts appearing or something.                                |
| 01:05:04   | So, you know, I want to go through and just see if I can modify it so that I'll have every                |
| 01:05:09   | shortcut when I type SC and then just shortcuts in folders when I like just search generically.           |
| 01:05:17   | I'm pretty certain I'm going to be able to do that because writing [[Alfred]] workflows has                   |
| 01:05:20   | actually been incredibly easy.                                                                            |
| 01:05:23   | And I have to say what the things that I've done recently is actually, I've been using                    |
| 01:05:30   | the, it is a workflow.                                                                                    |
| 01:05:32   | I'm just trying to remember the name of it, text expansion, where it can like watch what                  |
| 01:05:36   | you're typing and then like pop up a thing on screen to do like a fill in autocomplete.                   |
| 01:05:45   | And I know I could do this with a TextExpander, but I'm not running TextExpander on my work             |
| 01:05:48   | machine.                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:49   | So, I have basically this watches for like me typing a specific pattern and it checks                     |
| 01:05:56   | if I'm in like two specific applications.                                                                 |
| 01:06:00   | And if I'm in either of those applications, then it does the thing.                                       |
| 01:06:04   | Other than that, it just doesn't do it, which is perfect because I don't want it running                  |
| 01:06:08   | this the rest of the time.                                                                                |
| 01:06:11   | And that's something that's a little bit limiting with snippets in some other apps where like             |
| 01:06:15   | it's every app or no apps or specifically after I've typed like a semi-colon or something.                |
| 01:06:22   | I don't want to have to type a semi-colon in then my string.                                                |
| 01:06:25   | Yeah, I should have a play with [[Raycast]] at some point and see what I like about it and                    |
| 01:06:30   | so on.                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:31   | But for now, like my problem is, is [[Alfred]] works so well for me.                                          |
| 01:06:35   | I really don't want to change it because everything works.                                                |
| 01:06:39   | And you know, when you change a part of your workflow and you're like, yeah, I'm trying                   |
| 01:06:42   | to solve a problem.                                                                                       |
| 01:06:43   | And then you accidentally, instead of like getting rid of the loose pieces of like the                    |
| 01:06:46   | sand grains that are kind of bothering you in your shoe, you accidentally put an entire                   |
| 01:06:50   | beach and some sandpaper in your shoe.                                                                    |
| 01:06:52   | Like that's what I'm worried about doing.                                                                 |
| 01:06:55   | So I will, I'll have to avoid that.                                                                       |
| 01:06:57   | So let me weigh in a little bit.                                                                          |
| 01:06:58   | I've been using them both and they're both delightful.                                                    |
| 01:07:01   | I think [[Alfred]]'s new extension system is really good and [[Raycast]] has some amazing pre-written             |
| 01:07:08   | extensions.                                                                                               |
| 01:07:10   | I will say [[Alfred]], if you do any sort of file management, in my experience, [[Alfred]] runs                   |
| 01:07:16   | circles around [[Raycast]].                                                                                   |
| 01:07:17   | Like if you do, like I have certain [[Alfred]] commands that only search certain folders                      |
| 01:07:22   | and things like that, and I haven't figured out how to do that with [[Raycast]].                              |
| 01:07:26   | Same thing with customised queries of websites.                                                           |
| 01:07:28   | I feel like [[Alfred]] is better at that.                                                                     |
| 01:07:32   | But there are parts of [[Raycast]] that are just fun and like, I feel like kind of pre-packaged               |
| 01:07:38   | like the, like I was saying, the window sizing stuff earlier.                                             |
| 01:07:41   | And I did track down, there was a lightsaber command that got removed in December with                    |
| 01:07:45   | a, they said they temporarily removed it, but if you typed lightsaber, it turned your                     |
| 01:07:50   | cursor into a lightsaber.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:51   | I thought that was kind of fun.                                                                           |
| 01:07:53   | That's awesome.                                                                                           |
| 01:07:54   | That also screams to me, Disney lawyers.                                                                  |
| 01:07:57   | Who knows?                                                                                                |
| 01:07:58   | Disney have to defend their IP pretty vigorously, blame American Laws for that.                           |
| 01:08:03   | If you don't defend your IP, then you don't get to keep it.                                               |
| 01:08:07   | I hate lawyers, they ruin everything.                                                                     |
| 01:08:10   | I said American Laws, not Lawyers, David, just to be clear, but yeah, it's one of those                   |
| 01:08:17   | things.                                                                                                   |
| 01:08:18   | But yeah, I'm going to have to look at it.                                                                |
| 01:08:21   | I'm downloading it right now, just because I've been hearing about this from [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]]                     |
| 01:08:25   | Viticci and from you, Christopher, so long, that I'm going to have to try it, if only                      |
| 01:08:29   | to, you know, like, you know, give, give you, you folks are, you know, using this a fair                  |
| 01:08:34   | shot.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:35   | But it's one of those things where everything just works in [[Alfred]] and it's not that it                   |
| 01:08:41   | won't work in [[Raycast]].                                                                                    |
| 01:08:42   | It's that I'm going to have to get started by like, moving everything over into [[Raycast]].                  |
| 01:08:47   | And you have that muscle memory already too.                                                              |
| 01:08:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:51   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:52   | So even if I like swap it so that Alt Space opens [[Alfred]] and Command Space opens [[Raycast]],                 |
| 01:08:59   | like I use the searches in [[Alfred]] so much, like I'll type IMDB space, name a film or                      |
| 01:09:06   | series or something, or HA space, and then the name of the thing that I'm searching                       |
| 01:09:10   | for in [[Home Assistant]], which actually runs a duck-duck-go search with the site filter for                     |
| 01:09:16   | the [[Home Assistant]] website.                                                                               |
| 01:09:18   | And like the fact that you can do things like that so easily has just become part of my                   |
| 01:09:23   | muscle memory.                                                                                            |
| 01:09:24   | So I'm going to have to be...                                                                             |
| 01:09:25   | And you're not going to get all that.                                                                     |
| 01:09:27   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:28   | I've got to be careful about how I update things, but equally, you know, I, I can use                     |
| 01:09:31   | two tools.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:32   | Oh.                                                                                                       |
| 01:09:33   | And Siri just got triggered.                                                                              |
| 01:09:34   | And Siri agrees.                                                                                          |
| 01:09:35   | Siri just got triggered.                                                                                  |
| 01:09:36   | That was weird.                                                                                           |
| 01:09:37   | I, it was on my watch and I pushed my wrist far too far back.                                             |
| 01:09:40   | Sorry about that.                                                                                         |
| 01:09:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:42   | But Siri said that's what I figured.                                                                      |
| 01:09:43   | So obviously, Siri has spoken.                                                                            |
| 01:09:45   | I'm going to have to try this out.                                                                        |
| 01:09:48   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:49   | No, David, David's completely right.                                                                      |
| 01:09:50   | Like the file stuff is much better on [[Alfred]], but like the extensions, I, I think the extensions          |
| 01:09:57   | are better on [[Raycast]], but it's, it's, there's definitely trade-offs.                                     |
| 01:10:02   | And there's nothing wrong with running two of these things.                                               |
| 01:10:04   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:05   | You know, so I, I'm just scared that I'm going to forget that I've got both of them installed             |
| 01:10:09   | and then not use one of them.                                                                             |
| 01:10:11   | Now, one of them will be better at the other one for something and you're, you're enough                  |
| 01:10:16   | of a nerd that you're going to be like, Oh yeah, I want the [[Raycast]] window thing.                         |
| 01:10:19   | I don't want the [[Alfred]] thing.                                                                            |
| 01:10:20   | So I do it all day.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:22   | It's fine.                                                                                                |
| 01:10:23   | You know, and I'm more senile than you.                                                                   |
| 01:10:25   | So you'll be good.                                                                                        |
| 01:10:27   | Well, as it is, I will see what I can do at the moment.                                                   |
| 01:10:32   | I need to figure out the, the, the window so that it appears on my main window instead                    |
| 01:10:36   | of the, the active window, because my, my brain is broken when it appears on the window that              |
| 01:10:41   | my mouse is on.                                                                                           |
| 01:10:42   | Cause sometimes I bump my mouse around, but either way, I'll figure that out and we'll                    |
| 01:10:46   | have to report back in a future show, David.                                                              |
| 01:10:47   | I think we've, we've got a couple of a couple of hundred thanks to you guys actually content              |
| 01:10:51   | ideas for future shows.                                                                                   |
| 01:10:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:10:54   | So yeah, we'll have plenty more to talk about.                                                            |

| 01:12:28   | Our thanks to LinkedIn Jobs for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                          |
| 01:12:32   | Chris, okay, so I watch your videos and something you do is you keep making a reference to the            |
| 01:12:39   | keyboards.                                                                                                |
| 01:12:40   | In fact, you get a shelf behind you that looks like a war zone of mechanical keyboards.                   |
| 01:12:45   | Like something happened and clearly you have a problem, but I want you to share some wisdom               |
| 01:12:51   | with us.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:52   | People out there like mechanical keyboards.                                                               |
| 01:12:54   | How did you get into this?                                                                                |
| 01:12:56   | What are you using these days and what's making you excited about keyboards and what's the                |
| 01:13:01   | automation angle of this because I know there is one.                                                     |
| 01:13:04   | Yeah, so I got into this because a YouTuber friend of mine, his channel, his name's Gary,                 |
| 01:13:10   | the everyday dad, he posted a picture of a keyboard with a keycap set and it's like this                  |
| 01:13:15   | blue gradient keycap.                                                                                     |
| 01:13:17   | I can get you guys a link for the show notes, but it's this blue gradient keycap set and                  |
| 01:13:21   | it was just stunning.                                                                                     |
| 01:13:23   | It just looked amazing and I absolutely loved it.                                                         |
| 01:13:26   | So I asked him where he got it, bought it, ordered the thing and I didn't realise, but                    |
| 01:13:31   | it came completely disassembled.                                                                          |
| 01:13:32   | So I fell into the keyboard's trap.                                                                       |
| 01:13:36   | They got me.                                                                                              |
| 01:13:37   | And it wasn't my first mechanical keyboard, but my mechanical keyboard before that was                    |
| 01:13:42   | it was a WASD one.                                                                                        |
| 01:13:43   | It came completely put together.                                                                          |
| 01:13:45   | I didn't have to assemble anything.                                                                       |
| 01:13:47   | I just came with standard cherry blue switches, stuff like that.                                          |
| 01:13:51   | So this keyboard came completely disassembled.                                                            |
| 01:13:54   | I think it took me like four or five hours because I had no idea what I was doing.                        |
| 01:13:59   | I was like looking up videos and all sorts of different things, putting it together.                      |
| 01:14:04   | And once I got it together, I was like, you know, that was a lot of fun.                                  |
| 01:14:06   | That was just a lot of fun doing it.                                                                      |
| 01:14:08   | I absolutely liked it.                                                                                    |
| 01:14:09   | So I kept my eye out for other ones and I kept seeing like keycap set.                                    |
| 01:14:13   | Like I have a keycap set that is like a classic Mac keycap set, like classic, classic Mac.                |
| 01:14:20   | And it was just fun.                                                                                      |
| 01:14:21   | So like I started putting all these together.                                                             |
| 01:14:23   | If you're interested in getting into mechanical keyboards, I always tell people start with                |
| 01:14:27   | Keychron.                                                                                                 |
| 01:14:28   | Oh yeah, that's what I got.                                                                               |
| 01:14:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:32   | They make great keyboards.                                                                                |
| 01:14:33   | They're, I will say they're not as pricey as most mechanical keyboard sets.                               |
| 01:14:39   | And you can get them in different kind of levels of configuration.                                        |
| 01:14:41   | You can buy them completely put together with the switches and keycaps and not have to do                 |
| 01:14:45   | any of that stuff.                                                                                        |
| 01:14:46   | Or you can just get the base keyboard and provide your own switches and own keycaps and stuff             |
| 01:14:50   | like that.                                                                                                |
| 01:14:51   | There's there's a ton of different levels to how far you want to get into this.                           |
| 01:14:57   | And I've gone way into it.                                                                                |
| 01:14:59   | David's right.                                                                                            |
| 01:15:00   | I do have a problem.                                                                                      |
| 01:15:01   | I was counting the other day, including like macro pads and small keyboards and things.                   |
| 01:15:06   | I have about 15, which is a problem.                                                                      |
| 01:15:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:10   | I mean, you say it's a problem.                                                                           |
| 01:15:12   | I feel like I should take a moment to mention the Relay FM Discord, which is, if you're                   |
| 01:15:16   | a member of Automators Max, you've got access to the Relay FM Discord.                                    |
| 01:15:19   | If you're a member of any of the Relay shows or the All the Great shows member, then you                  |
| 01:15:24   | get access to that.                                                                                       |
| 01:15:25   | There is a keyboard channel.                                                                              |
| 01:15:26   | And I would just like to take a bonus moment to thank Ian of Earth for enabling me into                   |
| 01:15:32   | my lovely Keychron K4.                                                                                    |
| 01:15:35   | And he and some of the folks in the Keyboards channel know how that happened.                             |
| 01:15:39   | Basically, they were trying to make sure that [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] knew about something and accidentally               |
| 01:15:43   | pinged all of the mods.                                                                                   |
| 01:15:45   | And they made me buy a keyboard.                                                                          |
| 01:15:47   | That's my story and I'm sticking to it.                                                                   |
| 01:15:49   | But I got a Keychron K4 and I have to say, so I swapped the keycaps on it, swapped the                    |
| 01:15:53   | switches.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:54   | And so I've got the W4s and Sakura something or other keycaps.                                        |
| 01:16:00   | So I've got like a lilac fading to a lovely peachy colour through some pinks.                              |
| 01:16:04   | And it's gorgeous.                                                                                        |
| 01:16:05   | I love it.                                                                                                |
| 01:16:06   | And this is like the easy end of it, but I've not got into any Macro Pads or anything like                |
| 01:16:11   | that.                                                                                                     |
| 01:16:12   | I bought a Macro Pad actually the other day, Chris.                                                       |
| 01:16:13   | I didn't realise that you had Macro Pads when I did this.                                                 |
| 01:16:16   | So like, how are you using the Macro Pads?                                                                |
| 01:16:18   | Are you just like having them programmed as F keys and using them as like [[Keyboard Maestro]]                |
| 01:16:22   | or something?                                                                                             |
| 01:16:23   | Or, I mean, what's going on there?                                                                        |
| 01:16:25   | So some of the buttons are just F keys and, you know, I'll go into [[Keyboard Maestro]] and                   |
| 01:16:31   | set different actions to them.                                                                            |
| 01:16:33   | But where this gets really interesting with custom mechanical keyboards, a lot of them.                   |
| 01:16:38   | And basically anytime you go to order a custom mechanical keyboard, you can see what software             |
| 01:16:43   | is supported for this.                                                                                    |
| 01:16:45   | And I like one called Via.                                                                                |
| 01:16:47   | There's one other one, but it's extremely complex.                                                        |
| 01:16:50   | Like it is way too complex for its own good.                                                              |
| 01:16:53   | So I try and buy keyboards that are supported by what's called Via and it's a web app.                    |
| 01:16:59   | And the unfortunate thing is you have to use it through a Chromium browser.                               |
| 01:17:04   | It does not work through Safari or Firefox.                                                               |
| 01:17:06   | It has to be a Chromium browser.                                                                          |
| 01:17:08   | So I use Brave because I refuse to install Chrome on my Mac, but plug your keyboard in.                   |
| 01:17:16   | It'll get recognised for it.                                                                              |
| 01:17:17   | And there's a few things you can do with this.                                                            |
| 01:17:18   | So you can reassign keys and Via has support for media keys.                                              |
| 01:17:22   | So play, pause, backwards, volume keys, all that kind of stuff.                                           |
| 01:17:26   | So I have a macro pad off.                                                                                |
| 01:17:28   | It's the BN009.                                                                                           |
| 01:17:32   | This is one of those macro pads that it goes out of stock really quickly.                                 |
| 01:17:37   | So like if you see it and you want it, jump on it.                                                        |
| 01:17:41   | And it's completely customisable.                                                                         |
| 01:17:43   | It's nine buttons.                                                                                        |
| 01:17:44   | You can change out the switches.                                                                          |
| 01:17:46   | You can change out the keycaps.                                                                           |
| 01:17:47   | And I ordered some keycaps from WASD that were media keys.                                                |
| 01:17:51   | So I have, you know, backwards, play, pause, forward and volume up and volume down.                       |
| 01:17:57   | And then I also have four blank keys.                                                                     |
| 01:18:00   | And so you program these keys in Via and you, once you have what you want, you can basically              |
| 01:18:07   | you rebuild the firmware to the keyboard.                                                                 |
| 01:18:10   | So you're wiping out what is ever in the keyboard and you're rebuilding it.                               |
| 01:18:13   | And this doesn't have to just be the macro pad.                                                           |
| 01:18:15   | So my favourite keyboard right now is the Mode 80.                                                         |
| 01:18:20   | [[Myke Hurley]] is the one, he's responsible for making me buy this.                                          |
| 01:18:26   | But I programmed a couple of the function row keys to be media control keys.                              |
| 01:18:31   | So I have play, pause, volume up, volume down and skip and back on F11, F12, F13, F14, and                |
| 01:18:39   | F15 is what they technically would be.                                                                    |
| 01:18:42   | So those have been replaced.                                                                              |
| 01:18:44   | But you can take it a step further as well in Via.                                                        |
| 01:18:48   | So instead of just using the pre-assigned keys that are in Via like media keys or like                    |
| 01:18:53   | your standard symbols or modifier keys or letters or numbers, you can also do macros.                     |
| 01:19:00   | And what you do is you assign a macro key to be one of the keys in Via and then you                       |
| 01:19:06   | go into the macro section and you can write your own macros.                                              |
| 01:19:09   | So you could do this and have it trigger, you know, one key key press.                                    |
| 01:19:15   | You could have it trigger a series of key presses.                                                        |
| 01:19:18   | You can have it trigger the same key press over and over again.                                           |
| 01:19:20   | I'm sure for like gamers or something that would be like really cool because then you                     |
| 01:19:24   | could like farm whatever and whatever game, that kind of stuff.                                           |
| 01:19:28   | I don't play PC games, sorry.                                                                             |
| 01:19:32   | But what I did is I use this to basically give me keyboard shortcuts for triggering shortcuts             |
| 01:19:40   | like Siri shortcuts, shortcuts, the app on the iPad because on the iPad, there is no                      |
| 01:19:47   | keyboard shortcuts support on shortcuts for the iPad.                                                     |
| 01:19:52   | So what I did is I wrote a macro that hit command spaced, typed out the shortcuts name                    |
| 01:19:57   | and hit enter from one key press.                                                                         |
| 01:19:59   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:20:00   | That's pretty cool.                                                                                       |
| 01:20:01   | Did you look at using any of the accessibility features for this?                                         |
| 01:20:04   | Because I know that like iPad OS has a lot of accessibility features support and triggering               |
| 01:20:10   | keyboard shortcuts is part of this.                                                                       |
| 01:20:12   | And the reason why this comes to mind is I saw something on Amazon the other day and                      |
| 01:20:16   | I'm going to sound crazy when I say this.                                                                 |
| 01:20:19   | It was a TikTok camera ring.                                                                              |
| 01:20:22   | I don't entirely understand what this was and how it worked.                                              |
| 01:20:25   | I clicked on it because I had to click on it because I was like, what the heck is this?                   |
| 01:20:28   | I was looking for a remote camera shutter for the iPhone for my dad as a side note.                       |
| 01:20:31   | So that's how I stumbled across this.                                                                     |
| 01:20:34   | But basically what it is is it's a ring that you can wear, it recharges, it comes with                    |
| 01:20:38   | a case and so on.                                                                                         |
| 01:20:39   | I didn't order it because it seemed crazy for what we needed.                                             |
| 01:20:44   | But it has three buttons.                                                                                 |
| 01:20:45   | One of the buttons just presses the, I believe it's the volume up button, which is how you                |
| 01:20:50   | can trigger the camera on iOS to take photo.                                                              |
| 01:20:55   | But the other two buttons were using the accessibility features because you had to have the accessibility |
| 01:21:00   | features on to trigger something.                                                                         |
| 01:21:03   | And on iPad, if you have a trackpad or a mouse connected, you don't actually have to                      |
| 01:21:07   | see that accessibility dot.                                                                               |
| 01:21:09   | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:10   | So I was wondering if you can use that or do you barely see it flash up on screen as                      |
| 01:21:16   | it hits command space and types in the shortcut?                                                          |
| 01:21:19   | Is it that fast?                                                                                          |
| 01:21:20   | It's not that fast.                                                                                       |
| 01:21:23   | It works.                                                                                                 |
| 01:21:24   | But the accessibility feature, I enabled that, but it enables, and I don't remember what                  |
| 01:21:29   | it is off top of my head, but it enabled a few other things that I didn't want.                           |
| 01:21:34   | It was like...                                                                                            |
| 01:21:35   | If it went for the full keyboard control, then it would be tabbing between lots of things                 |
| 01:21:40   | and so on.                                                                                                |
| 01:21:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:21:42   | It was more than what I needed.                                                                           |
| 01:21:45   | And I just want to, okay, I'm going to pull back the curtain.                                             |
| 01:21:49   | I have made a request to Apple to pull just the keyboard shortcut bit out of that accessibility           |
| 01:21:56   | feature and make it a separate thing.                                                                     |
| 01:21:58   | So that way we could just have keyboard shortcuts for shortcuts.                                          |
| 01:22:04   | But yeah, but enabling that feature just enabled a bunch of other stuff.                                  |
| 01:22:09   | So I found this to be the best of both worlds, kind of be a good middle ground.                           |
| 01:22:15   | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 01:22:16   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:17   | No, that makes sense.                                                                                     |
| 01:22:18   | I was not thinking specifically of the full hardware control side of the keyboard, which                  |
| 01:22:21   | is something you can enable, but there are the other options where you can have things                    |
| 01:22:25   | mapped to, for example, the hot corners where swiping into a corner does a particular thing               |
| 01:22:32   | and so on.                                                                                                |
| 01:22:33   | So that's things that you can enable in the, I believe it's the accessibility settings                    |
| 01:22:38   | on iPad OS.                                                                                               |
| 01:22:41   | I left my iPad in the other room and I'm regretting it immensely right now.                               |
| 01:22:46   | So maybe if you have an iPad handy, then you could double check, but there's definitely                   |
| 01:22:49   | some other things in there that you can enable without doing full keyboard control, which                 |
| 01:22:54   | maybe worth looking into just to speed that up a little bit, optimisation, name it the                    |
| 01:23:01   | automation game, but I love this idea.                                                                    |
| 01:23:04   | So even for just thinking about this on a really basic level, it sounds like via, you                     |
| 01:23:11   | open a website from what I'm gathering, you've plugged the keyboard into your computer and                |
| 01:23:17   | having done something similar with, I use Edge because I also don't really want to install                |
| 01:23:21   | Chrome, it'll pop up and say, hey, do you want to allow this website to access devices                    |
| 01:23:28   | connected to your Mac and you say, I want it to be able to access this device, so it'll                   |
| 01:23:33   | just be accessing the keyboard and then you can kind of just go away and click on stuff                   |
| 01:23:37   | and see what magic happens or doesn't, that's the case maybe.                                             |
| 01:23:41   | But it sounds like from a very simple level, you could have this just peer text expansion                 |
| 01:23:48   | tool to start with.                                                                                       |
| 01:23:49   | So like button one, you hit it and it inserts Christopher Lawley, button two, you hit it                  |
| 01:23:53   | and it inserts your YouTube URL and so on and so forth and then you can expand that                       |
| 01:23:58   | to open the mail app with a new mail and type this information into the mail for me, which                |
| 01:24:07   | seems like a pretty cool way to get started for folks who are going, I'm not sure how                     |
| 01:24:12   | I would use this.                                                                                         |
| 01:24:13   | I think there's a lot of different ways you can use it, especially if you do a sequence                   |
| 01:24:16   | of really strange keys like F4, 0, P, N, backslash, that's not a sequence of keys that you're             |
| 01:24:24   | going to hit regularly, but if it types that and that triggers a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro                   |
| 01:24:29   | to run, well, you can actually have [[Keyboard Maestro]] run different macros depending on                    |
| 01:24:33   | what application you're in, using groups or whatever based on that single key, that's                     |
| 01:24:38   | really cool because that's one of the things I struggle with, you run out of buttons eventually           |
| 01:24:42   | in the F series.                                                                                          |
| 01:24:43   | Yes, and one of the benefits of doing it via, that was confusing, but you know what I mean,               |
| 01:24:51   | is that it's built into the firmware of the keyboard.                                                     |
| 01:24:55   | So if you have multiple Macs or if you're going between the Mac and the iPad or whatever,                 |
| 01:25:01   | it's built into the firmware of the keyboard, so no matter what computer your keyboard's                  |
| 01:25:05   | plugged into, it will always do that task.                                                                |
| 01:25:09   | So that's one of the reasons why I really like doing it that way as opposed to doing                      |
| 01:25:15   | the macros and stuff via [[Keyboard Maestro]] or something like that because yeah, I have                     |
| 01:25:21   | my MacBook Pro and I normally boot into Ventura now, but over the summer, I had whatever the              |
| 01:25:29   | previous version of macOS was that I'm already forgetting, and Ventura as, yeah, Monterey.                |
| 01:25:34   | So I had Monterey on my main drive and then I had a partition that was Ventura that I                     |
| 01:25:39   | could boot into that, and then I also had my iPad that I would plug into.                                 |
| 01:25:43   | So like this kind of just lets me unify that stuff a little more and my keyboard just plugs               |
| 01:25:48   | into the back of my studio display.                                                                       |
| 01:25:50   | So no matter what, so whatever computer is on the studio display, that's the keyboard.                    |
| 01:25:55   | This keyboard is controlling that computer.                                                               |
| 01:25:57   | You ready for to spend some more money, Chris?                                                            |
| 01:25:59   | Yes, yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:00   | Oh, I'm always ready.                                                                                     |
| 01:26:02   | I want you to look up the ultimate hacking keyboard.                                                      |
| 01:26:05   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:26:07   | That's the website.                                                                                       |
| 01:26:09   | We had Terpstra on a few months ago.                                                                        |
| 01:26:11   | I think, yes, I think I've heard, yeah, oh, this is totally right up my alley.                            |
| 01:26:17   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:26:18   | I've got another thing which may be on both of your alleys and I've just put a link                       |
| 01:26:23   | to it in the show notes.                                                                                  |
| 01:26:24   | So this is a translucent keycap set so that you can have all of the RGB's underneath your                 |
| 01:26:31   | keys and you can actually see them all.                                                                   |
| 01:26:33   | So I have some pudding keycaps which I'm going to swap some of my keys out to, but I'm now                |
| 01:26:40   | debating just getting this because I went on Prototypist because it said that they had                     |
| 01:26:43   | the BN009 Macropad in stock, unfortunately they don't, they're now out of stock.                          |
| 01:26:50   | And so I can't actually just buy it.                                                                      |
| 01:26:52   | I got very excited for a moment and was like, I'm buying this, it's happening.                            |
| 01:26:57   | And then I realised that I couldn't, I'm sure someone on keyboards will ping me as soon                   |
| 01:27:01   | as it's available if I ask them nicely.                                                                   |
| 01:27:03   | I think on their website they have a notify me when available as well.                                    |
| 01:27:08   | But yeah, it's such a great little, if you just need a nine button keyboard to do little                  |
| 01:27:16   | task here and there, it's so nice to just have off to the side.                                           |
| 01:27:19   | I really like that keyboard.                                                                              |
| 01:27:22   | These keycaps look great.                                                                                 |
| 01:27:23   | I'm not much of an RGB person.                                                                            |
| 01:27:25   | It's not my cup of tea, but I could totally see this.                                                     |
| 01:27:30   | I have one keyboard that doesn't have any letters or numbers or symbols on it.                            |
| 01:27:34   | It's just dots.                                                                                           |
| 01:27:36   | And I love people's reaction when they see that one because they're like, how do you                      |
| 01:27:39   | use this?                                                                                                 |
| 01:27:40   | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 01:27:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:27:42   | It's one of those things where sometimes this happened to me a couple of months ago.                      |
| 01:27:46   | I needed to do something on a friend's machine for them and they slid their keyboard over                 |
| 01:27:52   | to me and I glanced down at it and it was in a Dvorak layout.                                             |
| 01:27:56   | So for people who are not familiar with keyboards at all, like the standard layout for the Western        |
| 01:28:02   | world is Qwerty, where the first six keys across the top left are Q-W-E-R-T-Y.                             |
| 01:28:08   | If you are in France, it will be Azerty.                                                                  |
| 01:28:11   | If you are in Germany, it'll be Quartz, a very slightly depending on language.                            |
| 01:28:15   | But either way, it's a fairly standardised keyboard layout with things where you would                    |
| 01:28:19   | expect them to be.                                                                                        |
| 01:28:21   | And this is Dvorak layout.                                                                                |
| 01:28:24   | And so I sort of looked at it and went, huh.                                                              |
| 01:28:26   | And he was like, ah, can you touch type?                                                                  |
| 01:28:30   | I was like, yes, I can touch type.                                                                        |
| 01:28:31   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:28:32   | I'll just switch the input back to Qwerty and I'm there typing and staring at the ceiling,                 |
| 01:28:37   | trying to remember where my fingers need to go.                                                           |
| 01:28:40   | But I was successful in typing the short commands I needed to type to get everything done so                   |
| 01:28:45   | that worked.                                                                                              |
| 01:28:46   | But it was one of those moments where I was like, oh no, I theoretically know how to work                 |
| 01:28:50   | around this, but now it's going to be a test of my typing skills and how much of the mistakes             |
| 01:28:56   | I'm making is because I'm expecting to be able to look at the keycaps to remind myself                    |
| 01:29:00   | where the J and the K are next to each other versus I'm just typo-ing because my finger                   |
| 01:29:06   | hit the wrong key.                                                                                        |
| 01:29:08   | So I don't know.                                                                                          |
| 01:29:09   | But either way, it was successful in the end, but it's one of those things where seeing                   |
| 01:29:13   | somebody's keyboard with a very different layout can just mess with your brain for a                      |
| 01:29:17   | little while.                                                                                             |
| 01:29:18   | I mean, back in my IT days when people used to have, they would have those ergonomic mice,                |
| 01:29:22   | the ball mice, anytime I needed to go work on their computer, I would just bring a mouse                  |
| 01:29:27   | with me because I was like, there's no way I'm going to use this thing.                                   |
| 01:29:30   | Do you not just always have a mouse in your pocket?                                                       |
| 01:29:32   | Is this not a thing that other people do?                                                                 |
| 01:29:34   | Am I the weird one?                                                                                       |
| 01:29:35   | I mean, back in my IT days, I pretty much had, like I had a little bag that I carried                     |
| 01:29:40   | around with me and I had a mouse in there and I'd have like just like a handful of like                   |
| 01:29:44   | cables and stuff, but yeah, I hate those, those ergonomic ball mice.                                      |
| 01:29:49   | Like I don't know how anyone can use them.                                                                |
| 01:29:52   | It does break your brain a little bit sometimes.                                                          |
| 01:29:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:29:55   | So going back to the macro pad, are you using things like a Stream Deck or similar as well                |
| 01:30:02   | for videos or are you just all in on the macro pads?                                                      |
| 01:30:05   | So right now I'm all in on the macro pad, but Stream Deck actually just sent me the                       |
| 01:30:10   | new Stream Deck plus.                                                                                     |
| 01:30:11   | Oh, I love it.                                                                                            |
| 01:30:12   | I love it.                                                                                                |
| 01:30:13   | Disclosure.                                                                                               |
| 01:30:14   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:30:15   | It sent it to me.                                                                                         |
| 01:30:16   | Nice.                                                                                                     |
| 01:30:17   | It's cool.                                                                                                |
| 01:30:18   | It's interesting, but it is very limited if you aren't all in on like Elgato's like camera                |
| 01:30:24   | and lighting setup and stuff.                                                                             |
| 01:30:26   | So do you want a secret, Chris?                                                                           |
| 01:30:28   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:30:29   | Because I can share a secret with you.                                                                    |
| 01:30:30   | First of all, well, two secrets.                                                                          |
| 01:30:32   | There are other like systems like extensions that you can download into the Stream Deck                   |
| 01:30:37   | software for like Zoom, OBS, and I'm using it with Ecamm Live and things like that.                       |
| 01:30:43   | So you can download that into the software or uninstall the Stream Deck software, install                 |
| 01:30:49   | [[BetterTouchTool]], and let [[BetterTouchTool]] take over your Stream Deck.                                  |
| 01:30:52   | See, I've been meaning to do that and I just haven't had time to do that.                                 |
| 01:30:56   | I've heard, I think it was you that talked about it in the past that I heard you talk                     |
| 01:30:59   | and I was like, oh, I should do that and I wrote it down and I've just never gotten                       |
| 01:31:01   | around to it.                                                                                             |
| 01:31:02   | It's worth it.                                                                                            |
| 01:31:03   | So the OBS stuff, the Zoom stuff, I don't do a whole lot of those kinds of things.                        |
| 01:31:08   | Like I don't do a lot, a lot of live streaming or anything like that.                                     |
| 01:31:12   | So for me, the Stream Deck plus the only really, the thing that I only use the knobs for was              |
| 01:31:17   | volume control.                                                                                           |
| 01:31:18   | It was nice to have there that you could do that.                                                         |
| 01:31:20   | But like the regular Stream Deck, the 15, 16 button one, whatever the normal, the normal                  |
| 01:31:27   | one is, is just, it's so, it's perfect for like, if you want like a programmable macro                    |
| 01:31:34   | pad.                                                                                                      |
| 01:31:35   | But I really like the keyboard macro pads because one, I like those switches.                             |
| 01:31:40   | I like that clicky sound.                                                                                 |
| 01:31:41   | I like being able to customise the keycaps.                                                               |
| 01:31:44   | And then with via, I can program all the stuff that, you know, I would do on the Stream Deck              |
| 01:31:49   | into like the function buttons and stuff on, on my normal mode 80 keyboard.                               |
| 01:31:55   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:31:56   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:31:57   | That, that makes a lot of sense.                                                                          |
| 01:31:58   | I personally really like the Stream Deck for, for the fact that the, the pictures behind                  |
| 01:32:02   | the button can change.                                                                                    |
| 01:32:03   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:32:04   | That's cool.                                                                                              |
| 01:32:05   | So I, I actually have a visual representation of what it is that I'm about to press because               |
| 01:32:10   | I will have multiple folders and they will change depending on what I'm doing.                            |
| 01:32:15   | So when I'm recording automators, I get one, one deck up.                                                 |
| 01:32:18   | When I'm recording iOS day, I get a different deck up and they give me different buttons.                 |
| 01:32:21   | Um, and remembering what those are and just being able to quickly glance at what I'm                      |
| 01:32:26   | about to press and see, Oh, that's not showing me the automators deck.                                    |
| 01:32:29   | I need to hit the automators button and then hit that button is really useful.                            |
| 01:32:33   | Otherwise I might accidentally be tweeting that I'm recording iOS today live frequently.                  |
| 01:32:37   | Um, when I'm not, um, which could just be confusing for people.                                           |
| 01:32:41   | Um, but yeah, it's, it's, it's one of those things where setting it up, it takes a little                 |
| 01:32:46   | bit of work, but I feel like it's worth it.                                                               |
| 01:32:48   | And I, I've really been trying to get more stuff onto the Stream Deck and, and was particularly           |
| 01:32:53   | with the Stream Deck plus, uh, the, the touch bar, I, I need to check if there's an update                |
| 01:32:57   | for [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                    |
| 01:32:58   | Cause, um, I, I've enabled the alpha and I know that last time I checked, um, the, um,                    |
| 01:33:06   | the touch screen was not yet supported and neither was like a double press on the knobs                   |
| 01:33:10   | or the dials of the Stream Deck plus, but I believe, um, that, that may have changed.                     |
| 01:33:16   | Certainly it's, it's like, it's marked in the app as like, we know this is a thing.                       |
| 01:33:21   | It's just not here yet.                                                                                   |
| 01:33:23   | So hold tight.                                                                                            |
| 01:33:24   | Um, so yeah, but definitely take a look at it.                                                            |
| 01:33:27   | I personally feel like it is an excellent way to dive into, uh, the Stream Deck a little                  |
| 01:33:33   | more than, uh, then you, then you may have done, and particularly when you've got things                  |
| 01:33:37   | like shortcuts that you want to run, it's so easy to just run a shortcut from better                      |
| 01:33:40   | touch tool.                                                                                               |
| 01:33:41   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:33:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:33:43   | I, I, I, for me running shortcuts just goes back to [[Raycast]].                                              |
| 01:33:47   | It's just so easy to command space and cause usually my hands are already on the keyboard.                |
| 01:33:52   | So like just command space, type the shortcut name, enter, boom, runs, uh, that, that's                   |
| 01:33:57   | kind of where most of my shortcuts running works.                                                         |
| 01:34:00   | Oh, it's there.                                                                                           |
| 01:34:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:03   | I'm running the alpha.                                                                                    |
| 01:34:04   | So it may not be there in the release version, uh, for folks, uh, who are listening at home.              |
| 01:34:08   | Uh, but, uh, yeah, I have, I have touch screen support.                                                   |
| 01:34:10   | So I'm, I'm going to be playing with that, uh, you know, this weekend and just giving                     |
| 01:34:14   | that a go.                                                                                                |
| 01:34:15   | And for folks listening, Rose and, I have a, a future show on the updates to the stream                      |
| 01:34:19   | deck.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:20   | So stay tuned.                                                                                            |
| 01:34:21   | We're, we're both doing a bunch of experimentation right now.                                             |
| 01:34:23   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:24   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:25   | I'm excited for that one.                                                                                 |
| 01:34:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:34:27   | It's, it's going to be good fun.                                                                          |
| 01:34:28   | And, uh, it's one of those things where like being able to really dive into better touch                  |
| 01:34:31   | tool and it as an alternative control system is great, um, for, for folks who use windows,                |
| 01:34:37   | the Stream Deck software is much more powerful on windows, uh, than it is, uh, on Mac, uh,                |
| 01:34:43   | for various reasons, which are not entirely clear to me.                                                  |
| 01:34:46   | Um, I think it's just that the Stream Deck folks like windows more and think that more                    |
| 01:34:52   | windows people will use it.                                                                               |
| 01:34:53   | Um, I think it's a chicken and the egg problem, like the Microsoft phone, there are no users              |
| 01:34:57   | because there are no apps and there are no apps because there are no users.                               |
| 01:35:00   | We'll have fewer people using the Stream Deck if there's not great software for it.                       |
| 01:35:03   | But hey, [[BetterTouchTool]] is here to save the day.                                                       |
| 01:35:06   | So, uh, yeah, we'll have to, uh, dive into that in a future episode.                                      |
| 01:35:09   | Now that that's fully here, I may actually have to take this, this, uh, stream day plus                   |
| 01:35:13   | on holiday with me next week, David, no, um, can I take the standoff?                                     |
| 01:35:17   | There's screws.                                                                                           |
| 01:35:18   | Maybe I can take the standoff to make that a little lighter and fit in the car more easily.               |
| 01:35:21   | Well, either way, Chris, it sounds like you've, uh, you've really gone down the rabbit hole.              |
| 01:35:25   | I would love to hear if you ever decided to get one of these ultimate hacking keyboards.                  |
| 01:35:29   | I feel like someone like you might really have fun with it.                                               |
| 01:35:32   | Um, I, I have had one in a card for like eight months and I've just never pulled the trigger              |
| 01:35:37   | on it.                                                                                                    |
| 01:35:38   | I just can't.                                                                                             |
| 01:35:39   | I just, it's expensive and I just not sure if I really want to go that far down the keyboard              |
| 01:35:44   | rabbit hole, but I feel like, uh, you have reached that level that this may be in your                    |
| 01:35:49   | future.                                                                                                   |
| 01:35:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:35:51   | It definitely looks very interesting.                                                                     |
| 01:35:53   | I am setting it aside, uh, like, like we talked about, I'm moving, so, uh, there's a lot of               |
| 01:35:58   | expenses already.                                                                                         |
| 01:35:59   | So buying keyboards is on hold for right now, but, uh, I, I mean, if you have 15, you're                  |
| 01:36:05   | definitely going to end up with 16.                                                                       |
| 01:36:07   | Let's just be honest.                                                                                     |
| 01:36:08   | Oh yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:36:09   | No, I'm, I'm not saying I'm quitting.                                                                     |
| 01:36:11   | I'm not.                                                                                                  |
| 01:36:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:36:13   | No, I know, I know there will be more.                                                                    |
| 01:36:14   | Uh, it's, it definitely looks very interesting.                                                           |
| 01:36:16   | I, it is in my list of, uh, keyboard stuff I want to buy.                                                 |
| 01:36:21   | So, uh, you know, you have a problem when you have a notes document of, Hey, here's a bunch               |
| 01:36:26   | of stuff I want to buy.                                                                                   |
| 01:36:27   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:36:28   | And then, you know, the, the, the darn thing is the Apple keyboard has the touch ID button                |
| 01:36:33   | and that, that is so addictive.                                                                           |
| 01:36:35   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:36:36   | So, um, did you know that you can take the Apple keyboard apart and if you have a friend                  |
| 01:36:41   | with 3D printer, just, just saying, uh, then they can 3D print a little housing so that                   |
| 01:36:47   | you can put the touch ID from the magic keyboard with the touch ID into that housing.                     |
| 01:36:51   | So you can just have a touch ID button on your desk, which for me is great because when                   |
| 01:36:55   | I walk into a room, like I can, I could use touch ID to, to wake up my Mac and also authenticate          |
| 01:37:00   | like passwords and stuff on the Mac.                                                                      |
| 01:37:02   | Um, if you're, if you're Apple watches in sleep mode, you can't use it to, um, like                       |
| 01:37:06   | unlock things and similar on, on Mac OS.                                                                  |
| 01:37:09   | Um, and so when I, when I walk in, it's like being able to touch ID, hit a couple of stream               |
| 01:37:13   | depth buttons to get things set up the way I want.                                                        |
| 01:37:16   | Go grab some water, come back and you know, everything's set up with just the apps running                |
| 01:37:20   | that I want and things moved around and so on.                                                            |
| 01:37:23   | You know, it's, it's lovely and I sit down and do my work and then that's, that's where                   |
| 01:37:27   | [[Alfred]] comes into play.                                                                                   |
| 01:37:28   | So Rose, have you actually done that?                                                                     |
| 01:37:30   | You've, you've taken the touch ID out of it.                                                              |
| 01:37:32   | I have not done it yet.                                                                                   |
| 01:37:33   | I'm currently in the process of printing a couple of these little housings for the touch                  |
| 01:37:37   | ID button, uh, for somebody in the Relay FM, uh, discord, uh, which by the way, Chris,                   |
| 01:37:42   | uh, just, just to confirm your Hurley number is 15 then, uh, your Hurley number.                          |
| 01:37:48   | So in the Relay FM discord, there is a concept called the Hurley number, which is the number             |
| 01:37:51   | of keyboards you own.                                                                                     |
| 01:37:52   | Uh, I believe it's a number of keyboards you own.                                                         |
| 01:37:54   | There is a pin in the discord, in the discord channel for calculating your Hurley number.                 |
| 01:37:58   | Oh yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 01:37:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:38:00   | It would, yeah.                                                                                           |
| 01:38:01   | It would be 15.                                                                                           |
| 01:38:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:38:03   | Sorry.                                                                                                    |
| 01:38:04   | I, I need to be better about looking in on discords.                                                      |
| 01:38:05   | Uh, yes.                                                                                                  |
| 01:38:06   | It's, uh, 15.                                                                                             |
| 01:38:07   | Excellent.                                                                                                |
| 01:38:08   | All right.                                                                                                |
| 01:38:09   | I will make sure to mention that to them when this episode comes out because otherwise                    |
| 01:38:13   | I'm sure they're going to be messaging and saying, Hey, what's, what's Chris really                       |

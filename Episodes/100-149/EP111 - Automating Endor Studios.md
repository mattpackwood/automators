| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the automation podcast, where we automate all of the things             |
| 00:06      | and automate your technology into doing your automation bidding.                                          |
| 00:10      | David, could I have fitted the word automate into our intro one more time, do you think?                  |
| 00:14      | It felt automatic.                                                                                        |
| 00:15      | It felt automatic.                                                                                        |
| 00:16      | Well, I mean, there we go, because, I mean, I've been automating some stuff.                              |
| 00:20      | You've been automating some stuff.                                                                        |
| 00:21      | I've been automating my new iPhone purple pro, because they finally did purple this                       |
| 00:26      | year and I'm very excited about that.                                                                     |
| 00:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 00:29      | You're the first person I thought about when I saw that.                                                  |
| 00:31      | Now, I heard in the reports, I haven't seen one personally that they actually are not                     |
| 00:35      | that purple.                                                                                              |
| 00:36      | Are you satisfied with the purple-ness?                                                                   |
| 00:38      | So it really depends on the light that you look at it in.                                                 |
| 00:42      | And I'm very pleased to report that in the lighting in my office, it is exceptionally                     |
| 00:46      | purple and not only that, but the camera area is even more purple, which is, you know, the                |
| 00:52      | perfect part because, you know, I will be putting cases on this.                                          |
| 00:55      | I have the Apple Clear [[MagSafe]] case on there right now.                                                   |
| 00:59      | I also have a really lovely OtterBox sort of watercolour rainbow one, which I've got ready                 |
| 01:06      | for when I feel like changing things up.                                                                  |
| 01:08      | But, you know, I like the fact that the camera cutout is purple and I'm going to be seeing                |
| 01:13      | that and playing with that.                                                                               |
| 01:15      | And I'm slightly sad that shortcuts doesn't appear to be showing up in the dynamic island,                |
| 01:20      | but I figure we'll get to that at some point.                                                             |
| 01:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:23      | So generally, are your thoughts about the new phones?                                                     |
| 01:25      | I guess let's start cameras.                                                                              |
| 01:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:28      | You like the cameras?                                                                                     |
| 01:29      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:30      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:32      | I'm really liking it.                                                                                     |
| 01:33      | I'm liking the fact that we have the two-and-the-three-time zoom options now available to us.             |
| 01:36      | So when you go to take a picture, I think it was the 12 Pro that had the two-times optical                |
| 01:44      | zoom and then the 13 had the three times.                                                                 |
| 01:48      | And I like the fact that I now have both because of that 48 megapixel sensor.                             |
| 01:52      | It is really great.                                                                                       |
| 01:54      | I took some pictures when I picked up my phone because I had a bit of a problem with the                  |
| 01:58      | pre-order.                                                                                                |
| 01:59      | For some reason, it just didn't go through.                                                               |
| 02:00      | It wouldn't go through.                                                                                   |
| 02:01      | It wouldn't go through.                                                                                   |
| 02:02      | I know of canceling the pre-order and redoing my order from scratch.                                      |
| 02:06      | And the only way I was going to get it on launch day was I had to go and pick it up                       |
| 02:09      | in store in person, which I was able to do, thank goodness.                                               |
| 02:13      | So I had to go in storage, man.                                                                           |
| 02:15      | I got to see all the colours and confirm purple is best naturally, not that I was expecting                |
| 02:20      | anything else.                                                                                            |
| 02:21      | But yeah, so I went out and took some pictures while I was out and I'm really, really happy               |
| 02:29      | with the camera.                                                                                          |
| 02:30      | It's not that the camera before was bad, but this is one of the reasons why they sell                     |
| 02:33      | new iPhones every year, right?                                                                            |
| 02:35      | Because people want to upgrade for the camera and that the camera really is great.                        |
| 02:39      | My dad was asking me all sorts of questions about it.                                                     |
| 02:41      | I was like, do you really need the 14?                                                                    |
| 02:44      | Maybe I can have the 14 and you can have the 13.                                                          |
| 02:46      | And I was like, I've just had the 13 for a year and I'm not missing the purple iPhone.                    |
| 02:50      | Dad, come on.                                                                                             |
| 02:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 02:52      | Come on, dad.                                                                                             |
| 02:53      | You know, as you do, I took it to Disneyland and shot some pictures with it.                              |
| 02:57      | And I feel like the 2X is better than I expected because the way they're getting the 2X is                |
| 03:03      | they're taking the middle 12 pixels on the 48 megapixel sensor.                                           |
| 03:07      | But I mean, while the sensor is bigger, when you quadruple the number of pixels, the actual               |
| 03:12      | size of the pixels is smaller than the prior phone.                                                       |
| 03:16      | So I wondered if the 2X was going to be a little grainy and it actually looks pretty                      |
| 03:20      | good.                                                                                                     |
| 03:21      | I was doing some pixel peeping this morning on some of the 2X photos and they look very                   |
| 03:26      | good.                                                                                                     |
| 03:27      | And granted, I know Apple does a ton of post-production on those pixels, but they look better than        |
| 03:33      | I expected on the 2X.                                                                                     |
| 03:34      | And then I also am really curious for you as a software developer, what is your feeling                   |
| 03:39      | on the Dynamic Island and how does it look to you and all that?                                           |
| 03:43      | Well, I'm excited by this.                                                                                |
| 03:44      | And what I'm really excited by is the fact that they've tied this into those live notification            |
| 03:50      | updates.                                                                                                  |
| 03:51      | So we saw this come out at [[WWDC]], it's not in the 16 release, it'll be in 16.1 by the                      |
| 03:58      | looks of it, where you can have like a notification or a special activity, sorry, it's live activities    |
| 04:05      | on your lock screen.                                                                                      |
| 04:06      | So the examples or the classic examples are like you ordered an Uber seeing like, you                     |
| 04:11      | know, that your driver is this far away, this far away, this far away and they're here.                   |
| 04:16      | Or your Domino's Pizza, because it's got those four stages where you can go through them                  |
| 04:19      | and they can update the activity.                                                                         |
| 04:22      | I like the fact that it's tied into that, because I feel like where some of the features                  |
| 04:26      | before have struggled like force touch, 3D touch being one of them is the fact that developers            |
| 04:33      | don't want to invest the time developing for something that's only on certain models of                   |
| 04:38      | iPhone, because, you know, we already have enough problems with developers not doing                      |
| 04:43      | something for the iPad, because, well, you know, [[Instagram]], oh, well, we don't think that                 |
| 04:48      | there will be enough users for [[Instagram]] on the iPad and it's like, yes, because he prevent               |
| 04:53      | them from using [[Instagram]] on the iPad, that's why.                                                        |
| 04:56      | But you know, so I'm really glad that it ties in and I feel like this, this really is, you                |
| 05:02      | know, Apple saying like, hey, cool new feature, there's already rumors it's going to be across            |
| 05:06      | the iOS 15 lineup, of course.                                                                             |
| 05:10      | And you know, and also we're trying to make it easy on those awesome developers that,                     |
| 05:15      | you know, we keep talking about how great our app store is, we're trying to make it                       |
| 05:18      | easier for those folks because it's, you know, they develop once and it's in more places.                 |
| 05:23      | It's the same story with the lock screen complications are now the watch complications, you know, they're |
| 05:29      | one in the same.                                                                                          |
| 05:30      | So if you develop one, you don't quite get the other for free, but it's much closer than                  |
| 05:34      | it was.                                                                                                   |
| 05:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 05:36      | And I feel like this is a huge win for developers and it means that, of course, all of the awesome        |
| 05:41      | users of these devices get to benefit from that.                                                          |
| 05:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 05:45      | I think it's really nice and it got me thinking like, of course, this is here because of the              |
| 05:52      | camera cutouts, but what happens when the camera cutouts are gone?                                        |
| 05:56      | Is this going to remain and well, I kind of want to see it actually on the iPad because                   |
| 06:01      | for me, this is the menu bar, like the menu bar has come to my iPhone and I feel like                     |
| 06:06      | that is a really useful feature, you know, being able to see that, you know, like right                   |
| 06:11      | now this album is playing or something and to easily jump to it without going to the                      |
| 06:15      | notification centre or the control centre or having to slide over an app or split screen                  |
| 06:20      | or something.                                                                                             |
| 06:21      | Just being able to tap on it and get to this information, you know, I think that's really                 |
| 06:26      | cool.                                                                                                     |
| 06:27      | And I've seen some proof of concepts going around on Twitter where people are talking                     |
| 06:30      | about, you know, like, hey, maybe the Dynamic Island in the future could do this and this.                |
| 06:34      | And it feels like people have got a lot of ideas for it.                                                  |
| 06:37      | And I feel like personally, you know, like this area at the top of your screen, it's                      |
| 06:42      | not a dead zone, but like I personally always want to be able to see how much battery life                |
| 06:46      | I've got and what the time is and things like that.                                                       |
| 06:49      | And there was a craze a couple of years ago where developers would just be like, yeah,                    |
| 06:54      | I'm just taking you over the entire screen and you're not going to get to see the time                    |
| 06:57      | or what your battery like is like or what your signal is like or that you're on Wi-Fi                     |
| 07:02      | or not.                                                                                                   |
| 07:03      | And I feel like that has started trending away now because of the notch, because what                     |
| 07:07      | can you put in those corners, right?                                                                      |
| 07:09      | What is actually going to benefit the user?                                                               |
| 07:11      | And I feel like if the Dynamic Island sticks around, then, you know, that that's going                    |
| 07:17      | to be really useful.                                                                                      |
| 07:18      | I also think that maybe you get a better camera because they're not trying to blend it into               |
| 07:22      | the screen so much.                                                                                       |
| 07:24      | They are making a feature of it.                                                                          |
| 07:26      | So, you know, I don't know if we're getting a better camera, but there's two sensors up                   |
| 07:29      | there.                                                                                                    |
| 07:30      | You know, it's entirely possible that Apple are taking advantage of the fact that they've                 |
| 07:36      | put some software around that bit of hardware to give us something even more awesome.                     |
| 07:41      | So and I wouldn't put that past Apple.                                                                    |
| 07:44      | They've always been sometimes slow to implement a feature, right?                                         |
| 07:48      | But then they say, yeah, but we did it better.                                                            |
| 07:51      | And you know, sometimes they're wrong, but sometimes they're right.                                       |
| 07:53      | In this case, I think they're right.                                                                      |
| 07:54      | I mean, I think you're going to see this copied by everybody soon.                                        |
| 07:58      | But I mean, having been there when the Mac first arrived, I feel like the thing the Mac                   |
| 08:04      | brought to computers that I'd never seen before at the time was whimsy.                                   |
| 08:08      | And this feels like whimsy to me the way it kind of animates and bounces and it's kind                    |
| 08:14      | of cute.                                                                                                  |
| 08:15      | I don't know for lack of a better term and that that to me is nice.                                       |
| 08:18      | And I hope this is, you know, I hope they continue to think this way going forward and                    |
| 08:23      | add more whimsy to these devices to make them more personal.                                              |
| 08:27      | Did you notice if you dismiss an app and you do like a curveball, it like bounces off the                 |
| 08:32      | side of your phone and then goes into the dynamic island and like the dynamic island                      |
| 08:38      | will expand and then contract as it absorbs the app in.                                                   |
| 08:43      | Cable from Panic put a great tweet on Twitter showing that and he had a slow mo video.                    |
| 08:48      | I'll see if I can find it to put it in the show notes because I love the fact that there                  |
| 08:53      | is that whimsy in there.                                                                                  |
| 08:54      | Sure, if you just dismiss straight upwards, you're never going to notice this, but seriously              |
| 08:57      | folks, try.                                                                                               |
| 08:59      | If you've got a 14 pro or you can borrow a 14 pro from a friend for this, try playing                     |
| 09:04      | some music in the music app and then dismissing your phone and swiping it as far from like                |
| 09:10      | the right to the left or the left to the right as you can as you do this and just watch what              |
| 09:14      | happens with the app and the way that it sort of bounces off the screen and the dynamic                   |
| 09:18      | island absorbs it.                                                                                        |
| 09:20      | Quite good fun.                                                                                           |
| 09:21      | I spent a good five minutes doing that yesterday.                                                         |
| 09:23      | Yeah, I agree.                                                                                            |
| 09:24      | While we're on this topic before we move on, we started talking about the fact that shortcuts             |
| 09:29      | isn't really there.                                                                                       |
| 09:30      | I'm going to put you in charge of Apple and the shortcuts scene.                                          |
| 09:34      | How would you like to see shortcuts arrive in the dynamic island?                                         |
| 09:38      | Well, it's one of those things where on the one hand, do shortcuts belong in the dynamic                  |
| 09:43      | island?                                                                                                   |
| 09:44      | Yes and no, but I feel like shortcuts should be available on the lock screen and when a                   |
| 09:50      | shortcut is running, especially a longer running shortcut, it should interact with the dynamic            |
| 09:56      | island and show me that my shortcut is running.                                                           |
| 10:00      | If you tap the tile of a shortcut in the shortcuts app and you see that play button                       |
| 10:07      | pop up and it goes around and shows you the progress, why not do that?                                    |
| 10:11      | Show me the icon on the left and then over on the right hand side, show me the progress                   |
| 10:17      | of my shortcut and then as potentially things that I need to interact with pop up, let them               |
| 10:23      | slide down from that and expand.                                                                          |
| 10:26      | I feel like that would be a place to start and I have no idea how much heads up the shortcuts             |
| 10:32      | team had on the 14 Pro coming.                                                                            |
| 10:34      | I'm imagining they may have been a little busy with the whole iOS 16 thing, but regardless                |
| 10:40      | of whether or not they were given a heads up, but it would be really cool if they get to                  |
| 10:44      | do something with the dynamic island with things like that and potentially even maybe                     |
| 10:48      | suggesting shortcuts to you through that.                                                                 |
| 10:52      | When you go into the app switcher and it suggests apps for you based on handoff and things that           |
| 10:58      | you often use at this time of day and so on, it would be really nice.                                     |
| 11:01      | Maybe if the dynamic island could integrate with this too.                                                |
| 11:04      | It sure would and I do think that Apple is watching that every time they do something                     |
| 11:10      | like this, sometimes it will get completely ignored, remember the touch bar and then sometimes            |
| 11:18      | they'll build on it like focus modes last year, they really built on a lot and I think                    |
| 11:24      | dynamic island is interesting enough that this one merits further work and making it                      |
| 11:29      | more interactive and I love the idea of it on the iPad like you, I think it really could                  |
| 11:35      | be that thing.                                                                                            |
| 11:36      | On the iPad, what made mouse support on the iPad so interesting was that they made it                     |
| 11:41      | for an iPad.                                                                                              |
| 11:42      | They didn't just copy over mouse support from the Mac and I feel like this dynamic island                 |
| 11:47      | could be something similar in terms of trying to get menu bars and commands and things on                 |
| 11:53      | an iPad.                                                                                                  |
| 11:54      | I think there's something there to this that would be special and unique to the iPad so                   |
| 11:59      | I hope they're exploring it and I hope we get more of it.                                                 |
| 12:03      | Yeah, it'll be really exciting to see what happens and I think that's the thing with                      |
| 12:08      | all of these features right, we don't necessarily get everything from day one, we were talking            |
| 12:12      | about this in the last episode with shortcuts actions from certain apps, reminder seems                   |
| 12:17      | to add a bunch of features and then the next year it adds the shortcut actions for them.                  |
| 12:21      | I feel like especially when it comes to hardware features, not everybody can get a heads up               |
| 12:26      | on the software side but I feel like we will see things trickle in and especially if the                  |
| 12:31      | dynamic island comes to all of the iPhones next year then we'll see it in more and more                   |
| 12:37      | places.                                                                                                   |
| 12:38      | And then your idea about the lock screen or what do they call it now?                                     |
| 12:44      | It's not the lock screen, it's the sleep screen, the always on display widgets.                           |
| 12:49      | I would like to see them at least take a stab at getting some shortcuts in there.                         |
| 12:54      | The most of this stuff isn't very interactive so I'm not sure how it would work and it only               |
| 12:58      | gets refreshed once a second.                                                                             |
| 13:00      | Well, I don't necessarily need it to be able to update but just let me run the shortcuts                  |
| 13:07      | that I use most frequently in these focus modes.                                                          |
| 13:10      | If I have a fitness focus mode, let me have a button on my home screen that will let me                   |
| 13:17      | run a shortcut.                                                                                           |
| 13:20      | I can do that with the launcher app, obviously it has to unlock your phone and everything                 |
| 13:24      | to run it but other apps are doing this but the shortcuts app itself doesn't have lock                    |
| 13:30      | screen widget support which is a shame.                                                                   |
| 13:34      | So it does have watch complication support though so I wonder if maybe the shortcuts                      |
| 13:38      | team have said like, hey, we're going to focus on all of the other iOS 16 things that we have             |
| 13:44      | to do with to start with and then we're going to come back and look at watch complications                |
| 13:48      | and lock screen complications and do that together which would be pretty cool because                     |
| 13:53      | I know you can't do everything at the same time as much as we all wish that the shortcuts                 |
| 13:57      | team had infinite resources and availability.                                                             |
| 14:00      | I'm also glad that it's not a humongous team that can't get anything done because of its                  |
| 14:03      | own size.                                                                                                 |
| 14:04      | Yeah, then of course as a power user, I would like at least one lock screen with double                   |
| 14:09      | the widgets.                                                                                              |
| 14:10      | I would like more but I don't know, we'll take this stuff in baby steps.                                  |

| 16:02      | Okay, Rose, so the topic for today is all about me.                                                       |
| 16:07      | I've been talking about this so I have spent some money and built a little room.                          |
| 16:13      | I've added a room under the house for the purpose of recording in it and I just wanted                    |
| 16:17      | to have space that I kind of control, you know, I want to do more video with the Max                      |
| 16:21      | Berkeley Labs and the field guides and I do a lot of podcasting.                                          |
| 16:24      | I just need a nice space and I've tried, you know, using one of the bedrooms in the past                  |
| 16:30      | that didn't work out for a variety of reasons but now I have built dedicated space for it                 |
| 16:36      | and as you and I talked today they are installing the, what do you call it, the floor molding,            |
| 16:43      | you know, the baseboard in the room.                                                                      |
| 16:46      | Oh, right.                                                                                                |
| 16:47      | Skirting board in English.                                                                                |
| 16:48      | Okay, there you go.                                                                                       |
| 16:49      | I like that term better.                                                                                  |
| 16:50      | But the, it's painted, a lot of the finishes are in, the electrical isn't turned on yet                   |
| 16:55      | but it will be very shortly so everything is like, we're heading towards the end there.                   |
| 17:00      | I'm really hoping, I don't want to guarantee anything anymore because I feel like construction            |
| 17:04      | has a life of its own but I'm really hoping that the next time I sit down with you to                     |
| 17:08      | record the automators podcast I'll be in my studio.                                                       |
| 17:11      | Also.                                                                                                     |
| 17:12      | Which I've lovingly named indoor studios but the other thing that has occurred to me                      |
| 17:18      | kind of slowly throughout this process is I have always customised my home automation                     |
| 17:23      | around the fact that I live with other humans who do not listen to the automators podcast                 |
| 17:28      | and don't really care about a lot of that stuff.                                                          |
| 17:31      | Excellent.                                                                                                |
| 17:32      | So I've always had to like kind of reign myself in a little bit.                                          |
| 17:36      | You know, that's one of the reasons why the [[Lutron]] Caseta switches were such a win                      |
| 17:39      | for me because, you know, my wife and kids could still turn the lights off and on without                 |
| 17:44      | an, without an app, right?                                                                                |
| 17:47      | But it occurs to me Rose that this room is my room.                                                       |
| 17:52      | It's yours.                                                                                               |
| 17:53      | It's my room.                                                                                             |
| 17:54      | I mean, I picked the pink colours.                                                                         |
| 17:55      | So David, what I'm hearing here and you can correct me if I'm wrong is you would like                     |
| 17:59      | me to drag you down the rabbit hole Alice in Wonderland style.                                            |
| 18:03      | I have a Cheshire Cat green on my face ready for this because I'm so excited.                             |
| 18:08      | I even have purple stripey hair today because I just got my hair updated.                                 |
| 18:13      | So it's like the blue and purple stripes of the Cheshire Cat, which is just really perfect.               |
| 18:18      | I feel like this was meant to be because.                                                                 |
| 18:21      | Can I, can I just make one comment that you said you got your hair updated and I love                     |
| 18:25      | that about you that like, you look at like colouring your hair like a firmware update                      |
| 18:29      | and that's one of the reasons we love you.                                                                |
| 18:32      | I mean, it's honestly, I kind of consider it, you know, like when, when the new version                   |
| 18:36      | of iOS comes out and they've, they've changed something and just made it look a bit nicer                 |
| 18:39      | and maybe they haven't changed a lot under the hood.                                                      |
| 18:43      | You know, we don't know.                                                                                  |
| 18:44      | It all depends, but it just kind of looks like it's, it's got a, you know, a bit of                       |
| 18:47      | a fresh look.                                                                                             |
| 18:48      | You know, I kind of consider updating my hair the same way, you know, I go get my hair                    |
| 18:53      | coloured and have a lovely afternoon with my awesome hairdresser.                                          |
| 18:56      | And I feel like I come out with having, having had a bit of an update and, you know, a bit                |
| 19:02      | of a refresh.                                                                                             |
| 19:03      | That's almost like a UI update, like a new UI, whereas like, if you've got like, if you                   |
| 19:09      | broke your arm or something, that would be a hardware update when they fix that.                          |
| 19:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 19:13      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 19:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 19:15      | Having broken an ankle, not that long ago, which you bore witness to, I wouldn't recommend                |
| 19:21      | that side of the hardware update, but, you know, having a really good, nice long sleep                    |
| 19:26      | or something, which I've been doing a lot of in the last week because I took a week                       |
| 19:28      | off work, that, that also feels like a hardware update, so, you know,                                     |
| 19:32      | it definitely is.                                                                                         |
| 19:33      | So good.                                                                                                  |
| 19:34      | All right.                                                                                                |
| 19:35      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 19:36      | All right.                                                                                                |
| 19:37      | Well, that's cool.                                                                                        |
| 19:38      | But so the point for today is I have always been conservative about this stuff because                    |
| 19:42      | I didn't want to get something that was going to make my family crazy.                                    |
| 19:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 19:46      | Like, you know, one of the examples of the obvious examples is like infrared sensors                      |
| 19:50      | to turn lights off and on.                                                                                |
| 19:52      | And yeah, that seems great.                                                                               |
| 19:54      | And I would be totally cool with that in my house, but I'm not sure my family would,                      |
| 19:59      | honestly.                                                                                                 |
| 20:00      | And yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 20:01      | So, but, so I need you to guide me down this rabbit hole because I don't want, I want you                 |
| 20:07      | to make sure that I don't limit myself here.                                                              |
| 20:09      | You know, this is the chance, you know, I spent the money to build the room.                              |
| 20:13      | I'm definitely going to spend a little bit of money to make it cool with home kit stuff.                  |
| 20:19      | And that, that is one of my, that's one of my limitations for you today is it needs to                    |
| 20:24      | work in home kit generally.                                                                               |
| 20:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 20:27      | So, I guess maybe I could make an exception if you gave me a really good reason, but.                     |
| 20:31      | Well, don't forget you've got your home assistant yellow on the way and anything that you can             |
| 20:35      | add to home assistant, you can share back to home kit, which is what I do with all of                     |
| 20:40      | my things because I've gone pretty much hub-less now and I just have home assistant and it                |
| 20:45      | shares all of my sensors and things back to home assistant at home kit.                                   |
| 20:49      | If I actually want them in home kit because I've discovered I'd actually, like for example,               |
| 20:54      | the power plug that monitors my washing machine and tumble dryer, I do not want those in home             |
| 20:59      | kit because otherwise if I say, hey, Apple lady, turn everything off.                                     |
| 21:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 21:03      | Yeah, it doesn't matter if my washing machine's in mid-cycle, she's going to turn it off,                 |
| 21:07      | which is very much not my desire.                                                                         |
| 21:11      | So I have, I've been careful with making things available to myself because I know what I'm               |
| 21:18      | like, right?                                                                                              |
| 21:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 21:20      | You know, it's easy to make a mistake when it comes to something like that.                               |
| 21:23      | I feel like, you know, there's a lot that we can go through here and I feel like maybe                    |
| 21:28      | we need to start at the ceiling with the lights because I know you've mentioned to me before              |
| 21:33      | that you were installing some spotlights, right, in your ceiling.                                         |
| 21:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 21:39      | So that, I have, what I've done is the room has two lighting circuits, the main lighting                  |
| 21:44      | circuit, they're all can lights, you know, those, that's what we call them in the US.                     |
| 21:47      | They're like, they're inserted, they're embedded in the ceiling and there's a main set which              |
| 21:53      | are bright can lights and there's six of those.                                                           |
| 21:56      | And then there are many spotlights that I can actually kind of point, I can rotate and                    |
| 22:02      | point them a bit.                                                                                         |
| 22:03      | And they're lower wattage and they're all LED, but they're lower equivalent wattage                       |
| 22:10      | and there's six of them along to one wall and six of them along another wall.                             |
| 22:16      | So there's, in fact, let's just stop, stop, let me just take a minute to outline the room                 |
| 22:20      | for everybody listening.                                                                                  |
| 22:21      | It's 14 foot wide and 20 feet long.                                                                       |
| 22:24      | And so it's kind of like a long room on, and on the two small walls, you know, the 14 foot                |
| 22:30      | walls, one of them connects to the house.                                                                 |
| 22:33      | So I've got a door that goes from the house into the studio.                                              |
| 22:37      | And then on the opposite wall, the opposite 14 foot wall, there is another door that                      |
| 22:41      | goes to the backyard.                                                                                     |
| 22:43      | So I've got two doors and then one of the big walls faces south and that wall has no                      |
| 22:49      | windows, no doors.                                                                                        |
| 22:51      | It's just a long wall that I've done wood treatment on so I can use it for like a video                   |
| 22:56      | background.                                                                                               |
| 22:58      | And the reason I did that was because the sunlight is, when you try to record videos,                     |
| 23:03      | the sunlight, especially where I live in the afternoon is just brutal and it means you                    |
| 23:07      | can't record for like three hours.                                                                        |
| 23:09      | So now I have the problem solved, there's no window.                                                      |
| 23:12      | On the opposite long wall, there is a window there and, you know, kind of room for my desk                |
| 23:19      | and whatnot.                                                                                              |
| 23:21      | So that's the kind of the room setup.                                                                     |
| 23:22      | But in the ceiling, I've got these big, you know, main lights and these highlight lights.                 |
| 23:29      | And like one of the ideas of the many spotlights is they point down at that wood wall.                    |
| 23:32      | They're along the two long walls.                                                                         |
| 23:34      | There's a third lighting circuit in the room and that points at a plug that's in the outside              |
| 23:42      | of the door in the house.                                                                                 |
| 23:44      | So like the door that leads into the studio has a plug over the top of the door and I'm                   |
| 23:49      | going to put like an on-air light of some sort there, right?                                              |
| 23:53      | And so I can throw a switch and then people will know I'm recording, they don't barge                     |
| 23:57      | in while I'm recording.                                                                                   |
| 23:59      | And then there is one other circuit there where there are some plugs in the ceiling of                    |
| 24:03      | the studio.                                                                                               |
| 24:04      | That's not really lighting.                                                                               |
| 24:05      | But so there's a four switch like thing as you walk in.                                                   |
| 24:10      | The only thing I've done so far in terms of automation is I bought four [[Lutron]] Caseta                   |
| 24:16      | switches for that hurt.                                                                                   |
| 24:18      | Those are expensive, but they're all completely controllable through apps and automation and              |
| 24:24      | everything because they're all [[Lutron]] Caseta.                                                           |
| 24:26      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 24:27      | And I think, I mean, the really good thing about that as well is it's then consistent                     |
| 24:32      | with the rest of your house, right?                                                                       |
| 24:34      | So for you as well as you walk through, it doesn't feel like, oh right, because I'm in                    |
| 24:39      | this area, I have to act differently and use things differently to how I do in other areas                |
| 24:45      | of the house.                                                                                             |
| 24:46      | And if your wife or your daughters go into your studio to grab something for you maybe                    |
| 24:50      | or looking for you and they need to turn on a light, they're going to know how to do it.                  |
| 24:56      | And there's definitely something to be said there for the consistency of selling of that.                 |
| 25:02      | So those are also dimmable, right?                                                                        |
| 25:05      | Those [[Lutron]] Caseta.                                                                                     |
| 25:06      | Yeah, they have two different versions.                                                                   |
| 25:08      | I got dimmables.                                                                                          |
| 25:09      | Nice.                                                                                                     |
| 25:10      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 25:11      | Well, that is a great start because you've already got the lighting and you've got the                    |
| 25:13      | ability to control that.                                                                                  |
| 25:14      | And you're going to be able to use the [[Lutron]] Caseta with whatever solutions you end up                 |
| 25:19      | looking at because I think for me, one of the things that has worked incredibly well                      |
| 25:24      | for my home automation when it comes to recording podcasts and video is being able to tie the             |
| 25:31      | automation of things like the lights into the other context switching that I do because                   |
| 25:37      | I use Bunch to switch context.                                                                            |
| 25:40      | So like for example, when I sat down today, I clicked into the Bunch menu in my menu bar                  |
| 25:44      | on my Mac and I clicked the record automators Bunch.                                                      |
| 25:48      | And that does a whole bunch of things, including run some shortcuts, which will trigger scenes            |
| 25:54      | based on what I'm doing.                                                                                  |
| 25:57      | And so it turned on one particular light for me so that I can see easily while I'm recording.             |
| 26:02      | I'll be able to see everything on my desk and not knock over drinks and so on.                            |
| 26:06      | But because I have those different contexts, when I click on the record iOS today button,                 |
| 26:12      | it will turn on different lights behind me for the background lighting for the video                      |
| 26:18      | because iOS today also has a video component.                                                             |
| 26:20      | And I'm thinking, you haven't mentioned any colours in there at all yet.                                   |
| 26:26      | So I'm guessing that these are just white dimmables, maybe they have different shades                     |
| 26:32      | of white potentially?                                                                                     |
| 26:33      | Yeah, their temperature are just white, they're not like the full on three coloured lights.                |
| 26:40      | I can't change that.                                                                                      |
| 26:42      | What I'm wondering about is if you potentially want to add, so the Hugo or Iris or similar                |
| 26:50      | or there's some really lovely other colour lamps that you can get as well, I think Inner                   |
| 26:58      | makes some which pair to a Hue hub, which are really nice because the Hue hub will let you                  |
| 27:02      | pair some others that be devices to it and Inner INNR do you combine with that?                           |
| 27:07      | I'm wondering if maybe like one, two or even three colour lights just putting colour onto                   |
| 27:15      | the wood wall behind you, these are not intended necessarily to provide light in the sense                |
| 27:20      | of I'm seeing what I'm doing, but yeah, just accent lighting because that's one of the                    |
| 27:24      | things that Micah does on iOS today and I do as well.                                                     |
| 27:28      | And I see quite a few creators doing and of course, the best part of this is is you can                   |
| 27:32      | do seasonal theming.                                                                                      |
| 27:34      | So at Christmas, you can go all out with Christmassy colours, Valentine's Day, you could do reds            |
| 27:40      | and pinks and 4th of July, red, white and blue, I guess.                                                  |
| 27:45      | And if you can do that and it'll be fun for you as well because I'm guessing you would                    |
| 27:51      | enjoy having some fun colours there, but also it's just something that's a little bit different            |
| 27:59      | and it means that you've got that gorgeous wood, but you can add some contrast to it.                     |
| 28:03      | I'm thinking Halloween, if you've got like greens and purples and maybe some orange thrown                |
| 28:08      | in there or something, then especially if you adjust your spotlights a bit to increase                    |
| 28:13      | some of the shadowing on the wood, then that could be really good fun.                                    |
| 28:17      | And it's only a couple of lights and you can get some colour home kit compatible lights                    |
| 28:22      | pretty cheaply, which definitely makes it good fun.                                                       |
| 28:26      | Do you recommend the Hue or the Hugo's or which ones do you recommend?                                    |
| 28:31      | So I like my Hugo though, like it's one of those things where it says that it's a battery,                |
| 28:38      | a compatible one so that you don't have to have it plugged in.                                            |
| 28:41      | The battery does not really last long enough for me.                                                      |
| 28:43      | I find that like between like forgetting to charge it and then just like, oh, it ran out                  |
| 28:48      | of like battery while I was using it.                                                                     |
| 28:51      | It just doesn't feel like it lasts long enough.                                                           |
| 28:54      | The Hue iris and they had some mini iris at one point.                                                    |
| 28:57      | I'm not sure if they still have those would definitely be something that I would recommend                |
| 29:03      | because those are pretty bright and they're clear as well.                                                |
| 29:07      | The actual light itself is clear with a sort of band around the top where the actual light                |
| 29:13      | is.                                                                                                       |
| 29:14      | And so they're interesting, but it means that the colour comes out in all the places, which                |
| 29:19      | is quite fun.                                                                                             |
| 29:21      | So that's definitely something to look at.                                                                |
| 29:23      | I know that they also do, Hue also do outdoor lighting, which you've mentioned to me before               |
| 29:28      | that you were interested in looking at some fun lights for outdoors.                                      |
| 29:34      | So the fact that they also have like the lily spots for outdoor lighting is quite nice.                   |
| 29:40      | Yeah, I'm going to have to look into that.                                                                |
| 29:43      | And then they also have the Hue balloon.                                                                  |
| 29:45      | That's another one.                                                                                       |
| 29:46      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 29:47      | Yeah, that one's quite nice.                                                                              |
| 29:48      | That one, I've seen that before, but I've never ended up actually having one.                             |
| 29:55      | The bloom has the advantage over the iris of, of course, it's cheaper.                                    |
| 30:00      | The other thing that I could recommend, which especially if you're looking for colourful                   |
| 30:04      | accent lighting, I would give a 110 out of 10 to are the play bars.                                       |
| 30:10      | Now these are intended to like stick behind a TV too.                                                     |
| 30:15      | And then you can pair it with, say, a Hue sync box to play your media through.                            |
| 30:19      | So it goes through the sync box, which then talks to the play bars or a gradient strip.                   |
| 30:24      | And then, you know, it mirrors what's on your TV, essentially.                                            |
| 30:27      | So if you think Star Trek, the opening scene of Star Trek Next Generation or the credits,                 |
| 30:33      | sorry, where the ship goes to warp and it goes off in the top right corner of the screen,                 |
| 30:39      | like, you know, you have the lights and the lights go from the bottom left and then they                  |
| 30:43      | flash off at the top right just after the enterprise goes off screen.                                     |
| 30:46      | That's the sort of thing that these are intended for.                                                     |
| 30:49      | But the play bars don't have to be used like that, they're just Hue lights.                               |
| 30:53      | So you can actually use them like just to provide background lighting and they work                       |
| 30:58      | horizontally or vertically.                                                                               |
| 31:00      | They've got like a stand that comes with them.                                                            |
| 31:02      | So that might be worth looking at and you can get pairs of those, which I'm just looking                  |
| 31:08      | on the Philips UK website, a pair of play bars is £120 and a single bloom or go is £79.99.                |
| 31:16      | And then the iris is £95.                                                                                 |
| 31:20      | So it might be worth looking at that, even though, you know, these are not necessarily                    |
| 31:25      | intended as decorative lights, they're quite nice.                                                        |
| 31:30      | I certainly like the two behind my TV, they look pretty nice, they blend in, they're pretty               |
| 31:34      | discreet, but they provide a lot of colour when you're looking for them on top or below                    |
| 31:40      | or I mean on top and below.                                                                               |
| 31:41      | I mean, I have a TV that's not available in the US, it's actually got the sort of ambient                 |
| 31:48      | lighting strip built into the back of it.                                                                 |
| 31:50      | So it's got LEDs built into the back, but I've just got the play bar one left and one                     |
| 31:54      | right bounced on the TV stand just to provide extra lighting there.                                       |
| 32:00      | And it's really cool.                                                                                     |
| 32:01      | I really like it.                                                                                         |
| 32:02      | But the play bars are pretty awesome and I think that they would be good fun and also                     |
| 32:07      | you can always move them right and put them like on your desk pointing from behind your                   |
| 32:14      | monitor to the wall to provide backlighting so that the contrast between the screen and                   |
| 32:21      | the rest of the room isn't so high, which will help your eyes out.                                        |
| 32:23      | Yeah, that is one, I already have a hue colour strip along the edge of my desk.                            |
| 32:29      | So that one, that's the one, I guess that's one other piece of automation or lighting that                |
| 32:34      | I'm bringing in.                                                                                          |
| 32:35      | But I do want to, I think you're right, there needs to be a couple things that probably should            |
| 32:39      | because the background wall is going to be lit from above with white lighting.                            |
| 32:44      | I think that's going to look nice, but having a little colour accent below would be a good                 |
| 32:48      | idea.                                                                                                     |
| 32:49      | I also probably need to make a hairline light, you know, they make those lights you put behind            |
| 32:53      | you that point to the back of your head.                                                                  |
| 32:56      | I don't think a hue go would be appropriate for that, I think it needs to be something                    |
| 32:59      | a little more intense.                                                                                    |
| 33:00      | No, but honestly, actually the play bar might be, it would be pretty, like those things                   |
| 33:07      | are pretty bright if you're looking right at them and that might work really well.                        |
| 33:12      | And one thing I should mention that I really like about the play bar is you get the plug                  |
| 33:16      | for the play bar and it's like, it's a transformer plug, okay, so it's one of the larger ones,            |
| 33:22      | but it's got three holes in it, and so you can connect three lights to the same plug.                     |
| 33:28      | And that to me is just like one of those little things that like a lot of places wouldn't                 |
| 33:33      | necessarily think about, but Phillips definitely, you know, sat down and thought about this               |
| 33:37      | and thought like, how many plugs do people actually have around their TV units?                           |
| 33:42      | None, like they don't have spare ones.                                                                    |
| 33:45      | So like being able to plug, like you can do it with the gradient strip and the sync box,                  |
| 33:54      | I forgot the official name of the sync box, but either way, and the play bars, and you                    |
| 33:59      | can connect all those, you know, like they both, all of them I think come with like that,                 |
| 34:05      | the same transformer with multiple plug points on which is quite smart, so that works.                    |
| 34:09      | And the other thing to do is I got my iris on [[Amazon]] and I got it from their like return                  |
| 34:17      | section, like use like new, and it was genuinely like new, it was like brand new, it still                |
| 34:22      | had old stickers and everything on it, the box was just damaged.                                          |
| 34:25      | So it's worth keeping an eye out for that kind of deal.                                                   |
| 34:28      | And of course, you know, the time of year that we're at, you know, Black Friday and                       |
| 34:31      | so on will be coming up, so you can definitely look out for things like that to try and take              |
| 34:36      | advantage of it.                                                                                          |
| 34:38      | You know, I've looked at things like Hue has got something called a Signer light, S-I-G-N-E,              |
| 34:42      | and those look really pretty, but they are very expensive.                                                |
| 34:47      | They're like £190 for like, and they're really lovely standing lights, they can do multiple               |
| 34:53      | colours, but they're just expensive, very expensive.                                                       |
| 34:58      | And yeah, it's a bit of a shame, but I feel like there's plenty of other products out                     |
| 35:02      | there which offer really good value for money, even from the Phillips line, but the other                 |
| 35:07      | one to look at, of course, is Meross, because Meross have got some nice things, including                   |
| 35:12      | they've got their own, they've got a 10 meter, so three foot LED strip, which you can get                 |
| 35:21      | for like $40 on sale, that's a full retail price to be clear, and then they do other                      |
| 35:28      | things, and so they've got some stuff like that, but I don't know that they've got any                    |
| 35:33      | sort of like lights that would provide accent on that wooden wall that you've got behind                  |
| 35:40      | you for anything like this.                                                                               |
| 35:42      | I'm just checking their website and it doesn't look like they do, that they do have some                  |
| 35:45      | other cute ambient lights and desk lights and so on.                                                      |
| 35:49      | So for lighting, I'm going to have, the room is going to be well lit when I'm not like                    |
| 35:53      | in production, I've got two sets of lights, and then I do probably need some kind of accent               |
| 36:00      | stuff, and that would be cool, so I could push a button and it would turn off the main                    |
| 36:06      | lights, turn on the accent spots and something like a hue spotlight of some sort, coloured                 |
| 36:11      | spotlight in the background, and be up and going pretty quickly.                                          |
| 36:17      | Yeah, I think that that's a nice idea, I've got quite a few buttons, I've got lots of                     |
| 36:22      | IKEA buttons actually on my desk, but if you don't already have an IKEA hub, that wouldn't                |
| 36:26      | necessarily be such a good shout, but I know that you've already got an IKEA hub and the                  |
| 36:31      | IKEA buttons are pretty nice for things like that, and they have single press, double press               |
| 36:36      | and press and hold options, which means that you can have them do different things.                       |
| 36:41      | And don't forget, of course, with [[HomeKit]], any automation, if you scroll to the bottom,                   |
| 36:45      | you can do the convert to shortcut, meaning that the press button can be a toggle.                        |
| 36:50      | So like, hey, if the lights are in this mode, turn them into that mode, and if they're in                 |
| 36:54      | that mode, turn them into this mode or something.                                                         |
| 36:56      | Or set it as a scene and give it a URL, and then you can trigger it with a URL.                           |
| 37:01      | And I also was thinking I could script that to where like, if I have an appointment that                  |
| 37:06      | says like video production, and that's in the name of the appointment, it would just                      |
| 37:12      | turn them on, or if it's podcasting, it would do something else.                                          |
| 37:17      | Once I've got it in hooks into [[HomeKit]], then I can, you know, kind of disguise the limit                  |
| 37:21      | for me.                                                                                                   |
| 37:22      | Yes, yeah, this is something where I found [[Home Assistant]] to be exceptionally good because                |
| 37:27      | it's got calendar support, including like triggers X minutes before.                                      |
| 37:32      | So one of the things I did, I have a lava lamp in my office, and lava lamps look really                   |
| 37:38      | awesome in the background, but they look better when they've been on for half an hour to warm             |
| 37:43      | up than when they've just turned them on at the start of the show.                                        |
| 37:45      | So I have the lava lamp turned on 30 minutes before an iOS Today episode, and it just does                |
| 37:50      | that for me automatically because, you know, I haven't watched that calendar and it goes,                 |
| 37:56      | oh, right, 30 minutes for an episode, go, go, go, turn on.                                                |
| 37:59      | And that means that I just don't even need to think about preparing that.                                 |
| 38:03      | It's just done automatically based on my calendar.                                                        |
| 38:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 38:06      | For me, the final bit of lighting for me is, well, maybe it's the final bit.                              |
| 38:13      | I take that back.                                                                                         |
| 38:14      | I've got a couple of things.                                                                              |
| 38:16      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 38:17      | So number one is for the exterior of the building, I have some of those UV spotlights with integrated     |
| 38:23      | cameras, and I had them on the house before we did the construction I'm putting them back                 |
| 38:27      | on.                                                                                                       |
| 38:28      | I'm perfectly happy with those.                                                                           |
| 38:29      | They wire into an exterior light fixture, and we catch all sorts of stuff on it.                          |
| 38:35      | The other night, because the construction guys left their lunches out, we had a skunk                     |
| 38:39      | in my backyard going through their lunches.                                                               |
| 38:42      | And as you do.                                                                                            |
| 38:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 38:44      | So I showed them a video.                                                                                 |
| 38:45      | I was like, see guys, you got to pick up your trash, got one skunks in my backyard.                       |
| 38:50      | So that's cool.                                                                                           |
| 38:51      | That's figured out.                                                                                       |
| 38:52      | But then I also, because I don't think I'm going to put the desk next to the window.                      |
| 38:57      | Historically, I had a huge window behind my desk, which made lighting my face when I was                  |
| 39:01      | doing camera work on my, in front of my computer very easy, because I had a massive light source          |
| 39:08      | right behind it.                                                                                          |
| 39:09      | But the new window isn't as big, and I don't think I want to put this big monitor in front                |
| 39:13      | of my view.                                                                                               |
| 39:14      | So I think I'm going to scooch the desk a little bit to the right of the window.                          |
| 39:18      | And as a result, I'm going to put up a, one of those, I'm going to put up a light, you                    |
| 39:25      | know, one of those face lights that you put next to your screen to light you when you're                  |
| 39:29      | doing it.                                                                                                 |
| 39:30      | And I haven't picked one yet.                                                                             |
| 39:31      | But I don't know, have you got any experience with those?                                                 |
| 39:33      | I do.                                                                                                     |
| 39:35      | And there's a really nice Elgato light actually for this.                                                 |
| 39:39      | And I was, I just saw something the other day, I'm going to have to go back and find                      |
| 39:43      | it now, because it was on Twitter and it's going to be way back in my history, where                      |
| 39:47      | somebody figured out a way to control it using, I actually think it was Dan Moran on Six Colors           |
| 39:53      | even.                                                                                                     |
| 39:54      | So I probably saw it on Twitter first, but I'm now thinking that it was Dan on Six Colors                 |
| 40:00      | who was talking about this.                                                                               |
| 40:02      | He's got a way to control it from the Mac, which is of course, you know, something that                   |
| 40:06      | is really nice to have so that you can tie it into everything else you're doing.                          |
| 40:11      | Because for me, the magic of home automation, right, is where it really blends into everything            |
| 40:17      | else and just ties in.                                                                                    |
| 40:19      | I misspoke.                                                                                               |
| 40:20      | It is not an Elgato light.                                                                                |
| 40:21      | It is the Logitech Litra Glow and he's controlling it by shortcuts.                                       |
| 40:26      | So that is exactly what we wanted and I will be putting the link to that blog post in our                 |
| 40:30      | show notes for everyone.                                                                                  |
| 40:31      | I'll take a look.                                                                                         |
| 40:32      | I'm generally in the camp for Elgato because their stuff has always worked so well for                    |
| 40:38      | me, you know, but let me look at it.                                                                      |
| 40:40      | Well, this one, of course, he's got [[Stream Deck]] buttons for it now and that's in the                      |
| 40:44      | blog post and that light looks pretty good.                                                               |
| 40:47      | The other thing that I've done in the past and I have that running now is I just bought                   |
| 40:52      | some cheap studio lights of [[Amazon]], like USB power ones, like you plug them in there on,                  |
| 40:56      | you unplug them, they're off.                                                                             |
| 40:58      | And then I bought some smart USB plugs.                                                                   |
| 41:00      | So they're from Sonoff and it's just USB-A, but you can turn it on and off via Wi-Fi.                     |
| 41:08      | And those are pretty great.                                                                               |
| 41:10      | I've used them before I managed to get rid of the IKEA hub.                                               |
| 41:15      | It was definitely being a bit wonky and I found the solution to this was to reboot it                     |
| 41:19      | once a day.                                                                                               |
| 41:20      | So I just had the Sonoff like turn it off for like a minute at three o'clock in the                       |
| 41:24      | morning and then turn it back on again, which pretty much solved the problems I was having                |
| 41:28      | until I had the time to migrate everything over, which was good.                                          |
| 41:32      | But yeah, it's nice to see that there are more options for things like this coming out                    |
| 41:38      | as we go.                                                                                                 |
| 41:40      | I'm certainly liking, I like the Elgato stuff, but I do find it's also kind of pricey.                    |
| 41:48      | And I feel like if you're looking for something home automation-wise, then you can definitely             |
| 41:54      | find plenty of awesome options at very affordable prices, which definitely makes the cost of              |
| 42:02      | the new studio a little less, right?                                                                      |
| 42:04      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 42:05      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 42:06      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by LinkedIn Jobs.                                            |
| 42:10      | These days, every new potential hire can feel like a high-stakes wager for your small business.           |
| 42:14      | You want to be 100% certain that you have access to the best qualified candidates available               |
| 42:18      | and that's why you have to check out LinkedIn Jobs.                                                       |
| 42:20      | LinkedIn Jobs helps to find the right people for your team faster and for free.                           |
| 42:26      | It's one of those things.                                                                                 |
| 42:27      | Looking for a new job or a new person to work for you is really tricky and it's natural                   |
| 42:32      | that we're going to want to go and try and find out more information from whichever                       |
| 42:36      | side of the table you're sitting on.                                                                      |
| 42:38      | And the beauty of LinkedIn Jobs is, of course, that information is linked right there and                 |
| 42:42      | you can both see it.                                                                                      |
| 42:44      | So you know who you're going to be interviewing with or who's potentially going to be interviewing        |
| 42:50      | for your position and you get to see that information and get a better sense of who                       |
| 42:55      | these people really are.                                                                                  |
| 42:58      | You can have a free job post up and running within minutes on LinkedIn.                                   |
| 43:01      | It's so easy.                                                                                             |
| 43:02      | Then add your job and the purple hashtag hiring frame to your LinkedIn profile to spread the              |
| 43:05      | word that you're hiring.                                                                                  |
| 43:07      | And simple tools like screening questions make it easy to focus on candidates with just                   |
| 43:10      | the right skills and experience so you can quickly prioritise who you'd like to interview                 |
| 43:14      | and hire, meaning you can be sure to finish the year strong with the right team members                   |
| 43:20      | on board.                                                                                                 |
| 43:21      | That's why small businesses rate LinkedIn Jobs number one in delivering quality hires                     |
| 43:25      | versus leading competitors.                                                                               |

| 43:40      | Our thanks to LinkedIn Jobs for their support of this show and all of Relay FM.                          |
| 43:43      | All right.                                                                                                |
| 43:45      | So lighting is stuff I've been doing for some time with home automation, but the thing I've               |
| 43:52      | avoided really is a lot of automatic triggers.                                                            |
| 43:55      | That's because that's where I feel like I kind of make my family's life miserable.                        |
| 44:00      | But I feel like all the restraints are removed in this room.                                              |
| 44:05      | I'm all into sensors and which ones are you using and what kind of stuff are you doing                    |
| 44:11      | with them that you think would make sense for me?                                                         |
| 44:13      | Well, I mean, obviously we talked about this before, I have the vibration sensor on my                    |
| 44:17      | office chair.                                                                                             |
| 44:18      | So if I'm sitting fairly still in my office chair, it'll still notice me because there's                  |
| 44:22      | vibration and that sensor picks it up.                                                                    |
| 44:25      | And I have just standard motion sensors and door sensors in various rooms.                                |
| 44:30      | So my bathroom doesn't have a window.                                                                     |
| 44:33      | And so the door to the bathroom is open unless somebody's in there, which means that it's                 |
| 44:38      | very simple for me to have a door sensor when door is closed.                                             |
| 44:41      | Light stays on please.                                                                                    |
| 44:42      | And I also have a motion sensor in there.                                                                 |
| 44:44      | So if I just run in there to brush my hair or something, then it pops up on the light.                    |
| 44:50      | And that's pretty great.                                                                                  |
| 44:52      | But there's a new sensor out from Aqara, which of course I ordered.                                       |
| 44:58      | I managed to get it early from Aliexpress, it's the Aqara Human Presence Sensor FP1.                      |
| 45:05      | Okay, it's a bit of a mouthful.                                                                           |
| 45:08      | And it is a plug-in sensor that plugs in so it's not using batteries, it's not going                      |
| 45:15      | to run out and it uses mm-wave.                                                                            |
| 45:18      | But it is amazing at detecting somebody in a room.                                                        |
| 45:22      | Like if I had this in my office, I wouldn't need the vibration sensor.                                    |
| 45:25      | If I was sitting really still, it would still know that I'm here.                                         |
| 45:28      | And I've tested it in my living room.                                                                     |
| 45:30      | Like I just sat there reading for ages on my Kindle.                                                      |
| 45:33      | It did not notice me.                                                                                     |
| 45:35      | Like it didn't not notice me, sorry, is what I should be saying, like other motion sensors                |
| 45:40      | turned off.                                                                                               |
| 45:41      | And we're like, yeah, she's not here, even though they're like looking right at me.                       |
| 45:44      | Note the Aqara one, it knew I was there the entire time.                                                  |
| 45:48      | It was, it's really great.                                                                                |
| 45:50      | And this is where I would be going if I was looking for motion sensors.                                   |
| 45:54      | Like all of the other rooms, I've adequately carpeted them with things.                                   |
| 45:57      | I've got all sorts of things set up.                                                                      |
| 46:00      | Like I've been playing with a Raspberry Pi and a thermal camera in one room just to                       |
| 46:04      | see if I can do something with that.                                                                      |
| 46:08      | And they all work really well.                                                                            |
| 46:09      | But if you want something that just works and connects to the [[Aqara Hub]] and therefore                     |
| 46:15      | straightened home kit, yeah, this is the one.                                                             |
| 46:20      | It is exceptionally good.                                                                                 |
| 46:22      | And that is not in [[Amazon]] yet.                                                                            |
| 46:24      | As I've heard.                                                                                            |
| 46:25      | No, no, but it is available, for example, on Aliexpress.                                                  |
| 46:29      | I got mine within like a week of ordering it, which was pretty great.                                     |
| 46:33      | And it should be available through [[Amazon]].                                                                |
| 46:36      | And if you're in Europe, the Apple store is fairly soon, I believe, but it is definitely                  |
| 46:44      | coming.                                                                                                   |
| 46:45      | But this thing is impressive.                                                                             |
| 46:47      | It is incredibly good at sensing people, you know, even when you're asleep.                               |
| 46:51      | And it's using the newer [[Zigbee]] 3.0, which is slightly better at doing, you know, handoff                 |
| 46:57      | and so on, because [[Zigbee]] is a mesh network, right, where battery powered devices will                    |
| 47:02      | connect to powered devices on that same mesh so that they can, you know, pass the message                 |
| 47:08      | along essentially.                                                                                        |
| 47:09      | But previous generations of [[Zigbee]] and especially the Aqara stuff, it would just pair to whatever         |
| 47:16      | it was closest to and it would never look for another friend to help it talk to the                       |
| 47:20      | hub or the coordinator in the centre.                                                                     |
| 47:24      | And the 3.0 stuff is really good at doing that.                                                           |
| 47:27      | So, you know, I'm certainly not having any problems.                                                      |
| 47:29      | Of course, this is plug-in itself, which is great that I'm very impressed with it.                        |
| 47:34      | And I definitely recommend if you're looking for motion sensors, then this would be where                 |
| 47:40      | to go.                                                                                                    |
| 47:41      | And honestly, the [[Aqara Door and Window Sensor\|Aqara door sensors]], and you've already got the [[Aqara Water Leak Sensor\|flood sensor]], you've                     |
| 47:45      | had the fun with the dog that stole [[Aqara Water Leak Sensor\|the flood sensor]].                                                     |
| 47:50      | So your fridge was leaking, but it wasn't before.                                                         |
| 47:54      | But I definitely recommend looking into the [[Aqara]] stuff for sensors because it's very                     |
| 47:57      | affordable.                                                                                               |
| 47:58      | Their stuff itself is actually quite small, which is nice, you know, not taking up a huge                 |
| 48:03      | amount of physical space.                                                                                 |
| 48:06      | And I find [[Zigbee]] is exceptionally good for a connectivity option.                                        |
| 48:11      | You know, [[Thread]] is definitely something to look at and the Eve things look pretty great.                 |
| 48:16      | But there's not a lot of options out there which drives up the cost.                                      |
| 48:21      | Whereas if you get the slightly older generation of Aqara stuff, then that's even more affordable,        |
| 48:27      | which is definitely a win.                                                                                |
| 48:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 48:30      | And so to be clear, this is just detecting humans.                                                        |
| 48:33      | It doesn't give you like temperature data and things like that as well.                                   |
| 48:36      | No, no, this one won't give you things like that.                                                         |
| 48:38      | But also the best place to put a motion sensor is usually go be in the corner of your room.               |
| 48:43      | Like up fairly high, which is going to give you a pretty inaccurate temperature reading.                  |
| 48:47      | If you're looking for accurate temperature data, then you're going to want a temperature                  |
| 48:50      | sensor.                                                                                                   |
| 48:51      | Like, I mean, actually, I'd just go with a smart thermostat if I could.                                   |
| 48:55      | Because that is going to be the best way of controlling things because the other thing                    |
| 48:58      | is you only want the heat to be on to human comfort levels rather than, you know, mould                    |
| 49:05      | avoidance levels when you're actually in your office, you know, or you're going to be in                  |
| 49:10      | your office shortly.                                                                                      |
| 49:11      | You don't want it heating up at like three o'clock in the morning when you fall asleep                    |
| 49:14      | in bed.                                                                                                   |
| 49:15      | So I'd definitely go smart thermostat with the temperature controls that way and sensing                  |
| 49:21      | because those should be able to report what temperature it accurately is.                                 |
| 49:24      | Well, the nice thing about this Aqara occupancy sensor is it really does remove the need                  |
| 49:31      | for multiple sensors.                                                                                     |
| 49:33      | Like I was thinking for motion with a room 14 by 20, I'd probably have to put one in                      |
| 49:37      | opposite corners in order to be reliable, but hopefully this will be good enough to                       |
| 49:43      | get that whole room.                                                                                      |
| 49:45      | I think so.                                                                                               |
| 49:46      | Like it covers my entire living room very comfortably.                                                    |
| 49:51      | And you know, I've tried deliberately positioning in a way I didn't want it positioned.                   |
| 49:56      | And I put it in the far corner of my living room pointing at the doors, both of the other                 |
| 50:02      | doors in my living room.                                                                                  |
| 50:04      | Either there's a door to the outside, but the other doors into the hallway in the kitchen                 |
| 50:07      | are in the opposite corners to that.                                                                      |
| 50:09      | And I stood in my bedroom and waved at the sensor and it could see me.                                    |
| 50:17      | And I know because I then moved out of sight of the sensor and waited for it to say, no,                  |
| 50:22      | there's no one there.                                                                                     |
| 50:23      | And then waved at it from the bedroom again, like, you know, came back into view and it                   |
| 50:27      | spotted me.                                                                                               |
| 50:29      | And that was impressive.                                                                                  |
| 50:30      | I was really pleased about that.                                                                          |
| 50:32      | So I feel like this is definitely going to be one worth looking at.                                       |
| 50:37      | They are going to be sort of like $65-ish when they're available on [[Amazon]].                               |
| 50:43      | But one good sensor, definitely worth having over multiple cheaper sensors that you have                  |
| 50:49      | to position carefully and replace batteries on.                                                           |
| 50:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 50:53      | Now I just want to get my hands on one now.                                                               |
| 50:55      | I'm going to order one.                                                                                   |
| 50:56      | So I'll have to figure out that.                                                                          |
| 50:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 50:58      | I think we'll try and put a link to the place where I bought mine from Aliexpress in the                  |
| 51:03      | show notes because obviously I got my sensor and I was really pleased with it.                            |
| 51:09      | You will, as a side note for anybody who is ordering from Aliexpress, especially those                    |
| 51:14      | of you in Europe, you know, when you see the price, like after you add it to the basket                   |
| 51:19      | and go to the checkout, it then adds like the taxes for the import and everything for                     |
| 51:23      | you.                                                                                                      |
| 51:24      | So you won't get a surprise bill from customs afterwards, which is great.                                 |
| 51:27      | But the price that you see to start with is not including taxes, which for us is over                     |
| 51:32      | here is a bit of a headscratcher, obviously for you folks in America.                                     |
| 51:36      | Like you, David, it's less confusing because you're used to, you know, you see one price                  |
| 51:41      | on the shelf and then you go through the checkout and it's a different price.                             |
| 51:44      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 51:45      | But yeah, they do handle that for, you know, at least for those of us in the UK and Europe,               |
| 51:49      | which is great.                                                                                           |
| 51:50      | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 51:51      | So I'm going to have a human detection sensor.                                                            |
| 51:55      | I don't think, I don't know that I'm going to put a sensor on the door.                                   |
| 51:59      | I don't know what it would do for me.                                                                     |
| 52:00      | I have to think about it, but.                                                                            |
| 52:02      | Well, I wouldn't say that it's so much knowing about the door having been opened, but it's                |
| 52:06      | knowing that the door is open.                                                                            |
| 52:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 52:09      | Because if you think about summer, right, where you've got your air conditioner or winter                 |
| 52:14      | when you've got a heater on, you don't want the heating or the air conditioning running                   |
| 52:21      | when the door's open, right?                                                                              |
| 52:23      | Same as the window.                                                                                       |
| 52:24      | If the door of the window is open, then those really shouldn't be running.                                |
| 52:27      | And also, if you leave them open by accident, then it would be nice to have an alert if                   |
| 52:32      | they're open for more than a few minutes.                                                                 |
| 52:35      | So I personally am a big fan of having door and window sensors just because it allows                     |
| 52:41      | me to do things like disable the heating and things when those are, you know, when they're                |
| 52:48      | open.                                                                                                     |
| 52:49      | And also, I have it set up so that if I'm going somewhere, I run a shortcut and it tells                  |
| 52:56      | me which windows are open so that I know that I need to go around and close them as part                  |
| 53:01      | of what I'm doing so that when I leave, I don't accidentally leave all the windows open                   |
| 53:05      | or something.                                                                                             |
| 53:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 53:07      | I feel like you make a good argument because I do have them on the door because I don't                   |
| 53:11      | want the doors left open.                                                                                 |
| 53:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 53:14      | And sometimes people in the house forget to close the door.                                               |
| 53:16      | And that's probably not a bad idea to put one on the window either.                                       |
| 53:20      | And I want to talk to you later about a security, turning this into a quasi-security system.              |
| 53:24      | So maybe they're needed for that as well.                                                                 |
| 53:27      | But I'm going to have sensors in there detecting door and window status and human occupancy.              |
| 53:36      | The air condition I'm putting in is kind of like a unique system just for the room.                       |
| 53:41      | And I don't know that I'll be able to tie that into home kit, but either way, I may                       |
| 53:44      | put a temperature sensor in there.                                                                        |
| 53:47      | But what do I do with the triggers for these?                                                             |
| 53:49      | Now that we've talked about them, it's obvious that when you walk in the room and there's                 |
| 53:54      | a human there and it's nighttime, it's dark out, home kit's smart enough to do that to                    |
| 53:59      | turn basic lighting on.                                                                                   |
| 54:01      | I mean, personally, I'd also add a light sensor in.                                                       |
| 54:05      | So a luck sensor for clarity because if you add a luck sensor, then you can say, hey,                     |
| 54:11      | your motion's detected and the luck sensor is reporting less than X, then turn on the                     |
| 54:19      | lights, right?                                                                                            |
| 54:21      | Because you can use sunset and sunrise or an offset of sunset and sunrise to approximate                  |
| 54:28      | this.                                                                                                     |
| 54:29      | But if you've got a really cloudy day or you've had a really beautiful sunny day and the sunset's         |
| 54:34      | late in the evening, it might be turning on the lights when you don't need it to.                         |
| 54:39      | And so, yeah, I would definitely add that.                                                                |
| 54:43      | And then yes, what I do is I use motion sensors to turn on the lights.                                    |
| 54:49      | I very rarely touch a light switch or a button to turn on lights unless I want specific set               |
| 54:55      | up of lights.                                                                                             |
| 54:57      | Most of my lights just turn on automatically for me when I walk into a room and then they                 |
| 55:02      | stay on until I leave the room, which I feel like is something that with the Aqara sensor,                |
| 55:09      | you would be able to do because you can have home kit turn off lights when you're not there               |
| 55:15      | anymore.                                                                                                  |
| 55:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 55:17      | So that would certainly be an option for you.                                                             |
| 55:20      | Which light sensor do you use?                                                                            |
| 55:21      | Do you use the Aqara motion sensor that has a light detection?                                            |
| 55:24      | No, I have a dedicated Aqara lux sensor, which is just like it looks kind of like a, well,               |
| 55:33      | looks like an air tag, actually.                                                                          |
| 55:35      | That's how I would describe it.                                                                           |
| 55:36      | It looks like an air tag, but it works as a light sensor and it just reports the light                    |
| 55:42      | values back, which is great.                                                                              |
| 55:45      | And I have mine, I have one in each room actually, and I have them on my window sill in the room          |
| 55:52      | because it gives me a more accurate light reading.                                                        |
| 55:55      | And because in my case, I've got two different sides of my house, you know, I've got sort                 |
| 55:59      | of, it's not, I don't even remember what direction it faces in, by the way, the sun                       |
| 56:05      | is on one side of the building and that's on the other side of the building.                              |
| 56:08      | So you know, it means that I can say, hey, like when it's dark in this room, turn on                      |
| 56:16      | the lights, but that doesn't mean that it's dark for the whole house necessarily.                         |
| 56:21      | So that certainly helps improve the lighting for me as needed.                                            |
| 56:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 56:28      | I'm going to have to look those because I don't see that they sell those on [[Amazon]].                       |
| 56:31      | They've got a million Aqara products.                                                                     |
| 56:33      | Yeah, I just need to look deeper.                                                                         |
| 56:35      | Yes.                                                                                                      |
| 56:36      | So the originally, I think they were separately available from Xiaomi and could be a pair                 |
| 56:43      | to the [[Aqara Hub]], but I just ordered my own ones again.                                                   |
| 56:52      | I tend to order my Aqara accessories from Aliexpress just because they are affordable                     |
| 56:57      | and they arrive pretty quickly.                                                                           |
| 56:59      | But I think that one is a newer one and they definitely had a problem with the chip shortage              |
| 57:03      | during the pandemic where these were hard to get a hold of for a while, but they seem                     |
| 57:07      | to be more widely available now.                                                                          |
| 57:09      | So I'll put a link to that one in the show notes for everyone.                                            |
| 57:13      | Okay, excellent.                                                                                          |
| 57:14      | So I'll be getting my lights turned on.                                                                   |
| 57:16      | I'm going to bring, I've got at least one HomePod I can bring in and I thought that                      |
| 57:23      | would also be fun to build some automation when I go in there to play some music.                         |
| 57:28      | And I don't know if what I'm going to do with that exactly.                                               |
| 57:32      | I think I'm probably just going to have it play like one song when I enter the room.                      |
| 57:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 57:36      | At least I think it might get tedious to have, but I do like music quite often in the background.         |
| 57:41      | So we'll see.                                                                                             |
| 57:42      | And like, in terms of-                                                                                    |
| 57:43      | If I can suggest, I would have it do this as a, I mean, what I would do is I would have                   |
| 57:50      | it run or do a get conscience of URL as a home kid action.                                                |
| 57:54      | And that would then run something on my push cut server, which would check what's on my                   |
| 57:58      | calendar.                                                                                                 |
| 57:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 58:00      | And then I would record a podcast having it play some music, especially if I'm running                    |
| 58:03      | a bit late.                                                                                               |
| 58:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 58:05      | It would drive me up the wall.                                                                            |
| 58:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 58:07      | And that's when Siri, of course, is going to misunderstand you and go, yeah, sure, I'm                    |
| 58:10      | going to play some party music for you.                                                                   |
| 58:12      | No, no, no, this is not what I wanted you to do.                                                          |
| 58:15      | Thank you.                                                                                                |
| 58:16      | Got the disco ball.                                                                                       |
| 58:17      | Yeah, I get it.                                                                                           |
| 58:18      | Exactly.                                                                                                  |
| 58:19      | Exactly.                                                                                                  |
| 58:20      | Which, you know, obviously you're going to be considering adding as your next option.                     |
| 58:24      | But in the meantime, it would be definitely advisable if you can to hook your calendar                    |
| 58:30      | into that in some way so that it knows, hey, you know, don't turn, don't play the music                   |
| 58:36      | right now or David's not at home.                                                                         |
| 58:39      | That one you can do with home kit.                                                                        |
| 58:41      | So maybe don't play music when somebody comes in.                                                         |
| 58:43      | But yeah, those are good options.                                                                         |
| 58:46      | I definitely want to play with that and just kind of see where that goes.                                 |
| 58:49      | All right.                                                                                                |
| 58:50      | So let's take a quick break and I want to talk about curtains.                                            |

| 59:50      | You'll be expertly matched with your perfect coffee and a fresh bag of beans will be on                   |
| 59:54      | its way.                                                                                                  |
| 59:55      | Daisy and I signed up for trade coffee and we are digging it.                                             |
| 59:58      | They make it so easy to get signed up and find a coffee that you can try.                                 |
| 01:00:04   | Recently we've been trying a new roaster and that is one up at Lake Tahoe, California where               |
| 01:00:09   | we took our honeymoon.                                                                                    |
| 01:00:10   | That's why we picked them.                                                                                |
| 01:00:11   | They've also got a great name, Drink Coffee Do Stuff.                                                     |
| 01:00:14   | I love that name for a company.                                                                           |
| 01:00:15   | Anyway, the blend we've been trying is called Bark at the Moon and it's a rich and                        |
| 01:00:19   | comforting blend.                                                                                         |
| 01:00:21   | Daisy who drinks a lot more coffee than I really likes it and the advantage we've seen                    |
| 01:00:25   | by getting fresh beans delivered to the house is we actually spend less money because you                 |
| 01:00:30   | don't go buy that lousy coffee from those big places instead you get really good coffee                   |
| 01:00:34   | that you pick right at your house.                                                                        |
| 01:00:38   | Trade is the easiest way to get your very best tasting coffee delivered fresh when                        |
| 01:00:42   | you need it.                                                                                              |
| 01:00:43   | And you've got nothing to lose because trade guarantees you will love your first bag.                     |
| 01:00:47   | There's not the work with you to replace it for free.                                                     |

| 01:01:13   | And our thanks to trade coffee for the support of the automators and all of Relay FM.                     |
| 01:01:19   | Okay, so I know that you have curtains that pull shut with very kind of weird automation                  |
| 01:01:25   | stuff like it doesn't involve like weights and police.                                                    |
| 01:01:28   | I mean, I don't know.                                                                                     |
| 01:01:30   | Right.                                                                                                    |
| 01:01:31   | No, no.                                                                                                   |
| 01:01:32   | So I have, what are they like just curtains, I'm trying to remember they're not tab top                   |
| 01:01:38   | curtains.                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:39   | I think they're ring curtains.                                                                            |
| 01:01:41   | I'm trying to remember now what kind of curtains you can have.                                            |
| 01:01:44   | But let's maybe start with the blinds because I actually have smart blinds and you can get                |
| 01:01:48   | more smart blinds now, way more smart blinds than you could when I originally looked into                 |
| 01:01:54   | this.                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:55   | I lit curtains.                                                                                           |
| 01:01:56   | That's the kind of curtains I've got.                                                                     |
| 01:01:58   | But something else that you can do, and again, a car coming to the rescue here, a car I've                |
| 01:02:02   | got some blind controllers.                                                                               |
| 01:02:03   | So if you've got blinds, then you can actually have like if they're the sort of chain pulley              |
| 01:02:10   | ones, but also rollers, a car I sell a roller that you can put into a blind to control it.                |
| 01:02:19   | And of course, you know, there's lots of good options out there.                                          |
| 01:02:23   | We've had some folks sponsor the show.                                                                    |
| 01:02:25   | I have the IKEA blinds, IKEA have more options now than they did before.                                  |
| 01:02:30   | They don't just have blackout labels and the translucent ones.                                            |
| 01:02:33   | They've got like a pleated one, which is quite nice and so on.                                            |
| 01:02:37   | And there's a lot more options out there, and especially with the advent of the [[Zigbee]]                    |
| 01:02:43   | controllers for this, which I personally feel that if you've got a choice between a [[Zigbee]]                |
| 01:02:49   | or a [[Thread]] device or a Wi-Fi device, then you're better off with the [[Zigbee]] or [[Thread]]                    |
| 01:02:54   | one.                                                                                                      |
| 01:02:55   | Instead of the Wi-Fi one, the more things that you shove onto your network that are connected             |
| 01:02:58   | to the internet, the more likely it is something is going to go wrong.                                    |
| 01:03:02   | But yeah, so I have smart blinds.                                                                         |
| 01:03:05   | And then in front of that, I've got smart curtains.                                                       |
| 01:03:07   | And I've got a combination of [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot curtain controllers]], and I've got some Aqara ones                 |
| 01:03:11   | as well, which basically what they do is they sit on the curtain rail, and they grip the                  |
| 01:03:17   | curtain rail, and they are next to the innermost ring.                                                    |
| 01:03:22   | So they're between the first ring, like if you have two curtains closing in the centre,                   |
| 01:03:27   | you'll need two of these.                                                                                 |
| 01:03:29   | But the ring, like, you know, closes to the end and then the one next to it.                              |
| 01:03:33   | And so they're inside the curtain on the rail in there.                                                   |
| 01:03:37   | And then they just move it forward and backward, and they work super well.                                |
| 01:03:40   | I am really impressed.                                                                                    |
| 01:03:41   | Like, my curtains just open for me automatically when it's appropriate and closed.                        |
| 01:03:47   | You know, while we had our last break, I made sure that my curtains closed because they                   |
| 01:03:52   | do obviously make a little bit of noise as they close.                                                    |
| 01:03:55   | But it's nice that other than that, they would actually just close automatically in a few                 |
| 01:03:59   | minutes because that's when sunset is.                                                                    |
| 01:04:02   | And, you know, it's nice not to have to think about that, but also have it built into something.          |
| 01:04:08   | You know, if I'm going to be recording Iowa's Today, the automation that I run when I'm setting           |
| 01:04:13   | up the show is, hey, is the sun going to be setting in the next little bit?                               |
| 01:04:17   | Cool.                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:18   | I'm just going to close the shades right now because this way it's done.                                  |
| 01:04:21   | And then you set up there, and then, you know, I might manually tweak some lighting, but                  |
| 01:04:25   | the lighting then is done based on the fact that it's going to be dark outside and the                    |
| 01:04:30   | shades are closed.                                                                                        |
| 01:04:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:32   | I'm totally interested in this.                                                                           |
| 01:04:33   | If I just don't know yet what the acoustics of the room are going to be, like if the acoustics            |
| 01:04:37   | are good enough, I think I'd rather just put a set of shades or blinds in.                                |
| 01:04:44   | But if I need the, you know, sound dampening curtains to kind of absorb noise on the wall,                |
| 01:04:49   | then I'll go up a level.                                                                                  |
| 01:04:51   | But those sound dampening curtains actually usually have two or three layers to them, and                 |
| 01:04:55   | they're kind of heavy.                                                                                    |
| 01:04:56   | So.                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:57   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:58   | In my sense, the Aqara driver for the curtains is better than the [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot]] one.                          |
| 01:05:01   | [[SwitchBot]] now has a version two, which is really looking, you know, really, really good because           |
| 01:05:07   | I found that the [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot]] previously struggled with my floor length curtains in the living               |
| 01:05:12   | room.                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:13   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:14   | Now, they're a really nice sort of crushed velvet.                                                        |
| 01:05:15   | They are, you know, they're thermal as well as blackout curtains, which is great.                         |
| 01:05:22   | But they struggle with it because those are naturally quite heavy.                                        |
| 01:05:26   | But the new, so I have the rod version for most of mine.                                                  |
| 01:05:32   | I actually have the rail version as well for some curtains.                                               |
| 01:05:35   | But the new one looks like it's more powerful, but I got the Aqara one just because I was                 |
| 01:05:41   | curious and wanted to try it out and see if it was really good.                                           |
| 01:05:44   | And honestly, it's impressive.                                                                            |
| 01:05:48   | It's very, very powerful, which is great.                                                                 |
| 01:05:52   | And I have to say, it's nice that there is a solar panel option with the [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot]].                       |
| 01:05:58   | That being said, I found just based on the fact that it's so high up, and maybe it's                      |
| 01:06:03   | just the way that we hang our curtains in the UK, but the curtain rod is not level with                   |
| 01:06:07   | the top of the window.                                                                                    |
| 01:06:08   | It's above the top of the window.                                                                         |
| 01:06:10   | So by attaching the solar panel to like the [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot]], where the [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener\|SwitchBot]] is hanging,                    |
| 01:06:17   | like it doesn't get as much light as it probably ought to.                                                |
| 01:06:22   | And so it can struggle with recharging via solar.                                                         |
| 01:06:25   | But honestly, I just throw a large battery pack on the windowsill with some long USB-C                    |
| 01:06:30   | cables and charge them that way.                                                                          |
| 01:06:32   | And it works really well.                                                                                 |
| 01:06:33   | How often do you have to charge them?                                                                     |
| 01:06:36   | Like every six months or so?                                                                              |
| 01:06:38   | Not super often.                                                                                          |
| 01:06:40   | It's maybe two to three times a year, more if I'm showing off something.                                  |
| 01:06:45   | But it's not something that I feel like I need to do regularly at all.                                    |
| 01:06:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:50   | See, I'm not sure that I want curtains hanging because I don't like the distraction of them               |
| 01:06:55   | and dealing with them.                                                                                    |
| 01:06:57   | But I feel like ultimately, I'm probably going to need them because acoustics are a big deal              |
| 01:07:02   | in this room.                                                                                             |
| 01:07:03   | And the more I can dead in walls, the better, right?                                                      |
| 01:07:07   | I mean, you might be better off instead of getting curtains of just, you can get those                    |
| 01:07:12   | some really nice sound-dampening pictures where they're actual things that you hang                       |
| 01:07:18   | on the wall, but they're designed to absorb sound.                                                        |
| 01:07:20   | And the advantage of that is you're not going to have to close them when you want to record               |
| 01:07:23   | something.                                                                                                |
| 01:07:24   | Because otherwise, it's really lovely, nice sunny day in California, maybe in December                    |
| 01:07:30   | when there's fewer sunny days.                                                                            |
| 01:07:34   | And then you have to close the curtains because you're going to record.                                   |
| 01:07:36   | In other words, there might be a bit of an echo.                                                          |
| 01:07:39   | So you might find that actually doing things like that.                                                   |
| 01:07:43   | And the other thing I've seen, we did this in my old office in Austria, it's like fuzzy                   |
| 01:07:48   | dice that you can hang from your rear-free mirror type thing.                                             |
| 01:07:53   | These were not fuzzy, but they were cubes, which they were just hung from a corner and                    |
| 01:07:59   | suspended from the ceiling.                                                                               |
| 01:08:01   | And they were designed to be a sound absorption device.                                                   |
| 01:08:07   | And those were quite cool.                                                                                |
| 01:08:08   | And they came in lots of different artistic shapes and colours, which was quite fun.                       |
| 01:08:14   | So that might work and could combine as a decorative item for you.                                        |
| 01:08:18   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:19   | There are a lot of options out there for sound absorption.                                                |
| 01:08:21   | And like the wall treatment I did, the wood wall treatment actually has already helped.                   |
| 01:08:25   | But I just got a C and you don't want the room completely dead.                                           |
| 01:08:30   | No.                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:31   | But you also don't want it to have a noticeable echo.                                                     |
| 01:08:34   | No.                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:35   | No.                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:36   | So what definitely occurs to me is having a rug that you throw down on you when you're                    |
| 01:08:40   | going to be recording, especially if you're standing up and doing a video.                                |
| 01:08:43   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:08:44   | Like having a rug underneath your feet is like, A, it's going to keep your toes a bit                     |
| 01:08:48   | warmer, which is always nice, but B, it definitely will absorb any sound from just your feet              |
| 01:08:53   | moving on a smooth floor.                                                                                 |
| 01:08:57   | Carpet's pretty good for deadening things like that.                                                      |
| 01:08:59   | And if it's just a small rug, then it's easy enough to pick up so that you can have your                  |
| 01:09:03   | robot mop whizz around for you, because I know you've already got one of those.                           |
| 01:09:07   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:09:08   | It's already ordered.                                                                                     |
| 01:09:09   | The rug is already ordered.                                                                               |
| 01:09:11   | Of course it is.                                                                                          |
| 01:09:12   | It is exciting getting all this done.                                                                     |
| 01:09:14   | And I'm sure that it's not going to be perfect at the first go round, but being able to                   |
| 01:09:19   | set this stuff up to be automatically kind of running for me is something I'm looking                     |
| 01:09:24   | forward to for sure.                                                                                      |
| 01:09:27   | One of the things I want to do is look at my alarm options.                                               |
| 01:09:33   | I don't want it to be super intrusive, but if we're both leaving the house, can I arm                     |
| 01:09:40   | the doors?                                                                                                |
| 01:09:41   | I don't know.                                                                                             |
| 01:09:43   | Is there a home kit alarm unit?                                                                           |
| 01:09:45   | I've seen them in the past, but I've never tried one where it'll make noise.                              |
| 01:09:49   | My favourite part of this, David, is you already own one, which of course is everybody's favourite          |
| 01:09:55   | price tag, right?                                                                                         |
| 01:09:56   | It's free.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:57   | But if you've got an [[Aqara Hub]], it has an alarm system built in if you get door sensors                   |
| 01:10:01   | and motion sensors.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:02   | I didn't know that.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:04   | It does.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:05   | It does.                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:06   | So if you get door sensors, motion sensors, then it shows up in home kit as an alarm system.              |
| 01:10:12   | So the M1S and M2 hubs, those are the round hubs, have siren options, which can sound                     |
| 01:10:18   | a siren through the built-in speaker.                                                                     |
| 01:10:21   | Personally, I don't recommend that.                                                                       |
| 01:10:23   | If you're going to go with an alarm system, I would recommend the silent alarm system                     |
| 01:10:27   | option because the last thing that you want if somebody does break into your home is for                  |
| 01:10:31   | them to break more things for you.                                                                        |
| 01:10:35   | So I'd just go with the silent option and just turn on all the lights, make it really,                    |
| 01:10:39   | really bright, freak them out that way.                                                                   |
| 01:10:44   | But the thing is, you've got two alarm systems, actually, because you've got the eufye.                    |
| 01:10:48   | And the eufye camera system has options to do home mode and away mode, where it can record                 |
| 01:10:53   | differently to the base station, which is really nice.                                                    |
| 01:10:57   | And obviously home kit already handles the home kit secure video side of things.                          |
| 01:11:02   | But the [[Aqara Hub]] with those door and window sensors that I mentioned earlier and a motion                |
| 01:11:06   | sensor can also work as an alarm system for you.                                                          |
| 01:11:10   | And you can have it set into different modes semi-automatically through home kit.                         |
| 01:11:15   | Now I say semi-automatically because controlling an alarm system is something that requires               |
| 01:11:20   | confirmation.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:21   | So if you've ever had this pop up on your phone, like, hey, the last person just left                     |
| 01:11:27   | home, would you like to run the leaving home scene or whatever it is, automation?                         |
| 01:11:33   | Like, it's the same as when you try and do location-based shortcut trigger, right?                        |
| 01:11:38   | It's not entirely automatic.                                                                              |
| 01:11:40   | It wants you to tap it to confirm it.                                                                     |
| 01:11:43   | Because it's an alarm system, just like it would be if it was a lock or garage door,                      |
| 01:11:48   | it will require a manual confirmation to run.                                                             |
| 01:11:51   | And you can work around this as a side note by having it turn on a either real or fake                    |
| 01:11:57   | switch when you leave and then use the real or fake switch to turn on the alarm system                    |
| 01:12:02   | or open the lock or close the lock or whatever it is.                                                     |
| 01:12:06   | So it's up to you, obviously, how you do that.                                                            |
| 01:12:09   | Personally I went with building a fun alarm system in Home System because I'm that kind                   |
| 01:12:13   | of weird nerdy girl.                                                                                      |
| 01:12:15   | But you actually already have an alarm system, which is just something I'm really happy to                |
| 01:12:20   | be able to tell you, so I'm not costing you more money here, David.                                       |
| 01:12:22   | I'm saving you money.                                                                                     |
| 01:12:23   | Well, I want to talk about [[Home Assistant]] in a minute because I think that is going                       |
| 01:12:26   | to answer a bunch of problems, except I don't have mine yet.                                              |
| 01:12:29   | But that's going to be really useful.                                                                     |
| 01:12:31   | In terms of locks, I do have a home kit enabled deadbolt in there.                                        |
| 01:12:37   | So things are coming together for this build.                                                             |
| 01:12:42   | What am I missing in terms of home automation stuff that you would be using with a space                  |
| 01:12:47   | like this?                                                                                                |
| 01:12:48   | Well, I think one of the things that I have really built into my system and my day is                     |
| 01:12:56   | using lights and other things as cues for me personally.                                                  |
| 01:13:01   | So if I'm supposed to be doing this sort of thing, this is actually a trick I stole                       |
| 01:13:06   | from Scotty Jackson, who was on the show not that long ago, my co-host on Nested Folders.                |
| 01:13:10   | He has different colours to indicate that, hey, you're supposed to be doing a better                       |
| 01:13:13   | planning right now, stop doing the planning, get ready for this, and so on.                               |
| 01:13:19   | And I've been experimenting with that.                                                                    |
| 01:13:20   | I got a small coloured lamp and popped it on my desk.                                                      |
| 01:13:25   | And I have that changed colour, depending on what I'm supposed to be doing.                                |
| 01:13:29   | And I'm actually, I'm waiting for a new arrival of mine, which is a LumiCube.                           |
| 01:13:36   | So it's an LED matrix cube where you can light up in different colours, but I'm hoping that                |
| 01:13:41   | I'm going to be able to light it up with like a coloured icon and a little bit of helper                   |
| 01:13:45   | text underneath to tell me, hey, like you're supposed to be doing this thing now.                         |
| 01:13:51   | Like you've got XYZ time until this.                                                                      |
| 01:13:53   | It's a little bit like TJ Luoma's [[Stream Deck]] button for the calendar, where it colours                    |
| 01:13:59   | a button like red if there's something immediately happening on your calendar, or yellow if it's          |
| 01:14:04   | a little while away, or black if it's not happening for ages.                                             |
| 01:14:09   | And I think that having that tied in there has been really useful.                                        |
| 01:14:15   | And also just making sure that I don't forget to turn things off.                                         |
| 01:14:19   | It's not that I actively hate the environment, I love the environment, but I do have a tendency           |
| 01:14:24   | to forget to turn off lights in rooms.                                                                    |
| 01:14:27   | And I think some of this has been made a little bit worse potentially by having entirely                  |
| 01:14:31   | automated lights because I expect them to turn on and then turn off again and get a bit                   |
| 01:14:36   | confused when things don't necessarily happen like that.                                                  |
| 01:14:40   | But it is really great to know when I've finished for the day in my office, it puts the heating           |
| 01:14:47   | back to a much lower temperature and it will turn off the lights and so on for me.                        |
| 01:14:53   | And then before I'm going to go to bed, it'll remind me like, hey, don't forget, you left                 |
| 01:14:57   | the window open in this room and things like that, which all just helped me stay on top                   |
| 01:15:01   | of the things that I'm usually pretty good at doing by myself.                                            |
| 01:15:06   | And it means that I can not think about it at all just because I've got other things                      |
| 01:15:13   | that I want to be thinking about, which is really nice as far as these things go.                         |
| 01:15:19   | David Allen said, if you keep thinking about it, then you've not finished, it's still                     |
| 01:15:24   | a problem, right?                                                                                         |
| 01:15:25   | You don't trust your system.                                                                              |
| 01:15:26   | Well, I don't trust my system at all, like my mental system, so I just off-boarded all                    |
| 01:15:31   | of that into home automation.                                                                             |
| 01:15:32   | One of the things I'm interested in is this idea of a status board and I've been using                    |
| 01:15:37   | an iPad parked under my main screen for about a year now and that works great.                            |
| 01:15:42   | But because I'm spending so much money, I figured why not spend a little more?                            |
| 01:15:46   | I bought a deal on a TV off [[Amazon]] that I'm going to hang in the studio.                                  |
| 01:15:53   | It's not going to be in my direct line of sight when I get my screen, my computer screen.                 |
| 01:15:59   | But one of the ideas for it is to have an iPad driving just the iPad home screen at it                    |
| 01:16:06   | all day and set it up as a big status board, where it's going to have the time, my appointments,          |
| 01:16:11   | my pending tasks, and I think all of this would be fairly simple with just using the                      |
| 01:16:16   | home screen of the iPad, widgets, and a conversion to an HDMI cable and just have it run it.              |
| 01:16:23   | Yes, that certainly would be possible, but the other thing that occurs to me, David,                      |
| 01:16:28   | you kind of put a little bit of a pin in it earlier, when you get [[Home Assistant]], a Home                  |
| 01:16:32   | Assistant dashboard can do all of that and you can have it switch between dashboards in                   |
| 01:16:41   | [[Home Assistant]] automatically through shortcuts as well because the [[Home Assistant]] app of course           |
| 01:16:46   | has got shortcut support, which makes displays like that really cool and useful.                          |
| 01:16:54   | I've been experimenting with using the cast feature that's built into [[Home Assistant]] to                   |
| 01:16:59   | get dashboards to appear on my kitchen TV, but I have a slight problem, well, I have                      |
| 01:17:05   | a multitude of problems.                                                                                  |
| 01:17:07   | The kitchen TV is very old, and the Chromecast that I'm using for that is also very old,                  |
| 01:17:12   | and surprise, surprise, guess what happens?                                                               |
| 01:17:14   | It somehow just massively overestimates the size of the screen, so I'm missing a good                     |
| 01:17:20   | inch around the edges.                                                                                    |
| 01:17:22   | But on other TVs, it works great, and on other devices, it works really well.                             |
| 01:17:28   | And I've been playing with this and being able to tie it into different things so that                    |
| 01:17:32   | I see a different dashboard or areas of the dashboard at various times can be really,                     |
| 01:17:38   | really helpful.                                                                                           |
| 01:17:39   | So I don't see a bunch of stuff while I'm working, but then I do see things at other                      |
| 01:17:43   | times.                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:44   | I really wish that we had got the different home screens with iPadOS 16 this year because                 |
| 01:17:51   | we didn't got them on iPhone, because that would be really great, right?                                  |
| 01:17:54   | You're in a podcasting mode, and it shows you, hey, this bit of information is really                     |
| 01:17:58   | useful to you right now, but next year, next year.                                                        |
| 01:18:03   | But in the meantime, you'll be able to open and close different apps automatically.                       |
| 01:18:08   | I kind of feel like if we can get push cut automation server running, maybe even on that                  |
| 01:18:15   | same iPad, and then just have it update things for you, that would be even better.                        |
| 01:18:20   | But we'll have to wait and see.                                                                           |
| 01:18:24   | This episode of Automators is brought to you by Rogue Amoeba.                                              |
| 01:18:28   | Congratulations.                                                                                          |
| 01:18:29   | Rogue Amoeba software is celebrating their 20th anniversary.                                               |
| 01:18:33   | That means two full decades of making amazing audio apps for the Mac.                                     |
| 01:18:37   | If you're a podcaster, musician, or just someone who listens to audio on their Mac, Rogue                 |
| 01:18:41   | Amoeba can make your life better.                                                                          |
| 01:18:43   | Whatever you want to do with audio is a very good bet they have a tool to help you.                       |
| 01:18:47   | With Audio Hijack, you can record any audio.                                                              |
| 01:18:50   | feedback gives you extremely powerful audio routing without needing cables or mixers.                     |
| 01:18:54   | And sound source is the sound control that should be built into Mac OS, but isn't.                        |
| 01:18:59   | Honestly, I love all of those three and everything else that I've used from Rogue Amoeba.                  |
| 01:19:06   | But I really love the fact that all of these apps just help me do everything that I need                  |
| 01:19:10   | to do easier.                                                                                             |
| 01:19:11   | I had an issue recently where I was getting a really strange sound periodically randomly                  |
| 01:19:17   | seemingly happening on my Mac, couldn't figure out what it was doing.                                     |
| 01:19:20   | Well, I just pinned open sound source and I was able to spot the culprit really quickly                   |
| 01:19:25   | and because I didn't need audio from that, I muted that app.                                              |
| 01:19:29   | Perfect.                                                                                                  |
| 01:19:30   | Solved.                                                                                                   |

| 01:20:05   | Our thanks to Rogue Amoeba for their support of this show and Relay FM.                                    |
| 01:20:10   | So Rose, you've been teasing me about [[Home Assistant]] now for like six months.                             |
| 01:20:15   | So when you told me about it, you're like, this is amazing.                                               |
| 01:20:17   | It really helps.                                                                                          |
| 01:20:19   | I ordered one.                                                                                            |
| 01:20:20   | Yeah, you ordered [[Home Assistant]] yellow to be clear.                                                      |
| 01:20:24   | That's the new, that's the currently, they just started shipping it and mine has not                      |
| 01:20:30   | come yet.                                                                                                 |
| 01:20:31   | I could have had it today if I wanted to go and buy a computing device and install it                     |
| 01:20:37   | and do all that.                                                                                          |
| 01:20:38   | I mean, I didn't have to wait six months.                                                                 |
| 01:20:40   | But I just decided, I got a lot on my plate right now.                                                    |
| 01:20:44   | I don't want to fiddle with this.                                                                         |
| 01:20:45   | I'll order one.                                                                                           |
| 01:20:46   | It'll be done when it gets here.                                                                          |
| 01:20:47   | I don't have to worry about it.                                                                           |
| 01:20:49   | But today you keep talking about it.                                                                      |
| 01:20:51   | So I feel like I don't even really know what this [[Home Assistant]] thing is supposed to do.                 |
| 01:20:56   | If you think of Home Automation as a system, okay, it's like an operating system, right?                  |
| 01:21:05   | You can have [[HomeKit]], which is the sort of macOS of operating systems.                                    |
| 01:21:12   | But it's really more of an iOS of operating systems in that it certainly has amazing features             |
| 01:21:18   | and it's definitely got some good bonuses of the fact that, you know, it requires your                    |
| 01:21:25   | devices to have local control.                                                                            |
| 01:21:26   | So if your internet is down, then you can still control your devices providing the same                   |
| 01:21:32   | Wi-Fi network and so on and things like that.                                                             |
| 01:21:35   | But it's also limited in the fact that it has to explicitly support [[HomeKit]] for your                      |
| 01:21:42   | device to work.                                                                                           |
| 01:21:43   | And I've always been okay with that because my wife and kids also use it.                                 |
| 01:21:46   | And I feel like I don't want to make it so complex that it makes them crazy.                              |
| 01:21:51   | Absolutely.                                                                                               |
| 01:21:52   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:21:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:21:54   | But you can also see, like, you know, it's the same like as we have with the Home app                     |
| 01:21:58   | where if you use the Home app to automate something, you've only got these options.                       |
| 01:22:03   | But if you use, say, controller for [[HomeKit]] or Home Plus, then you get more options when                  |
| 01:22:08   | you run an automation.                                                                                    |
| 01:22:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:10   | You know, you can improve it, but Apple's still limiting you.                                             |
| 01:22:13   | And I'm not suggesting this is an artificial limitation.                                                  |
| 01:22:16   | It's set up because, quite frankly, this is what a lot of people want or need.                            |
| 01:22:21   | But for those of us who want or need to be able to do more, [[Home Assistant]] is an open                     |
| 01:22:28   | source and it does have an operating system option that will be running on the [[Home Assistant]]             |
| 01:22:32   | yellow that you get, David, which will let you integrate with, I believe, last time I                     |
| 01:22:40   | checked, I'm just going to go to the [[Home Assistant]] website a second, which is homeassistant.io           |
| 01:22:44   | Home Dash Assistant, it is 2,176 integrations in [[Home Assistant]].                                          |
| 01:22:53   | So this is everything from Sonos and the IKEA stuff to, you know, it has direct [[Zigbee]]                    |
| 01:23:01   | and Z-Wave integrations, Ring Doorbell, [[Lutron]], and Leviton, for example, but it also integrates          |
| 01:23:10   | with [[Google Calendar]], [[Todoist]], [[Remember the Milk]], and it can even integrate with things                   |
| 01:23:16   | like Starling, which is a bank over here in the UK, it can integrate with your energy                     |
| 01:23:23   | company to tell you how much energy you're using, and of course, it's got [[HomeKit]] support                 |
| 01:23:28   | and they're working with Master on getting Master and [[Thread]] support in there as well.                    |
| 01:23:34   | The [[Home Assistant]] yellow that you get, David, should indeed have [[Thread]] support, which is                |
| 01:23:39   | a really nice option.                                                                                     |
| 01:23:41   | But the idea of [[Home Assistant]] is I don't have to buy a device that's specifically labelled               |
| 01:23:48   | for [[HomeKit]], because as we all know, when we go and look at these things, right, if                       |
| 01:23:52   | you go and look at a case for a phone, if you're looking for a case for, say, I don't                     |
| 01:23:57   | know, a Samsung phone, it's probably, say, 20 bucks.                                                      |
| 01:24:00   | And if you look at the same case for an iPhone, it's 25.                                                  |
| 01:24:03   | You've got the Apple tax, right?                                                                          |
| 01:24:05   | And some of this is warranted, some of it's not warranted, but if you look for a [[HomeKit]]                  |
| 01:24:08   | compatible device, you will always be looking at a more expensive option pretty much, like,               |
| 01:24:14   | it's really going to be cheaper than the non-[[HomeKit]] one.                                                 |
| 01:24:16   | And especially when you look and you can see two devices on the shelf next to each other,                 |
| 01:24:21   | one of them's got the [[HomeKit]] sticker and the other one doesn't.                                          |
| 01:24:24   | You can tell that there's a price difference without even looking at the tax.                             |
| 01:24:28   | But what this allows you to do, among other things, is connect whatever you want into                     |
| 01:24:34   | your home automation system, and you could just use it as an advanced version of Homebridge               |
| 01:24:40   | and say, hey, I just want to, like, share these devices that don't have [[HomeKit]] support                   |
| 01:24:45   | back into [[HomeKit]].                                                                                        |
| 01:24:47   | But what you can also do is make your own devices.                                                        |
| 01:24:52   | So I don't have a garage, right, like, I live in an apartment, it doesn't have a garage,                  |
| 01:24:57   | I have a parking space, it's a very nice parking space.                                                   |
| 01:25:00   | But I don't have a garage, but [[HomeKit]] and CarPlay have support for a garage door, which                  |
| 01:25:05   | if you turn on Siri Suggestions in CarPlay will show up on that screen where you've                       |
| 01:25:10   | got, like, half of it's a map, and then there's music and some other things on the left-hand              |
| 01:25:15   | side.                                                                                                     |
| 01:25:16   | It'll show up as a Siri Suggestion if you've got a garage door when you arrive home.                      |
| 01:25:18   | Well, I made a garage door.                                                                               |
| 01:25:21   | I just shared my door lock into [[HomeKit]] as a garage door, and now when I get home, I                      |
| 01:25:29   | can tap the garage door button and it unlocks my door for me as I get out of the car.                     |
| 01:25:34   | I added a slight delay to that before I did it, but that means that I now have the option                 |
| 01:25:39   | to unlock my door as I'm getting out of the car, which especially if it's raining, can                    |
| 01:25:43   | save me a couple of seconds of standing there getting a bit wet, which is really nice.                    |
| 01:25:48   | But I've also been able to integrate my calendar.                                                         |
| 01:25:51   | So when iOS Today is about to start, or 13 minutes before, it will turn on my level arm                   |
| 01:25:56   | for me.                                                                                                   |
| 01:25:57   | So I don't need to think about that.                                                                      |
| 01:25:59   | Am I dumb heaters, which I put on smart plugs?                                                            |
| 01:26:02   | Well, I connected a temperature sensor to it and said, okay, temperature sensor plus                      |
| 01:26:06   | smart plug on heater equals [[HomeKit]] thermostat, because that's something that I was able to               |
| 01:26:12   | do through the generic thermostat integration.                                                            |
| 01:26:16   | And so that's kind of the first part of it, of taking whatever it is that you've got,                     |
| 01:26:21   | even if it's a smart device and making it smarter.                                                        |
| 01:26:24   | And then there's the other side of it, which is the automations, where you can say, okay,                 |
| 01:26:29   | every automation has been pre-converted to a shortcut.                                                    |
| 01:26:34   | There is no converted shortcut option, it's always a shortcut, essentially.                               |
| 01:26:37   | And then I can say, hey, I'm going to have a choose, okay, so if it is Monday, I want                     |
| 01:26:44   | you to do this.                                                                                           |
| 01:26:45   | If it is raining, I want you to do that.                                                                  |
| 01:26:48   | And otherwise, I want you to do this other thing.                                                         |
| 01:26:50   | And all of that is just built into the automation system, which you can use or you can not use            |
| 01:26:55   | depending on what you want.                                                                               |
| 01:26:58   | So you have all of those options, and then you've got a dashboard of your home showing                    |
| 01:27:05   | you kind of whatever it is that you want to see in whatever way that you want to see it.                  |
| 01:27:10   | So if I log into my [[Home Assistant]] dashboard right now, I can see, obviously, all of the                  |
| 01:27:19   | things in my home.                                                                                        |
| 01:27:20   | So you can see that I have a range of 161 kilometres in my car, so I can drive 161 kilometres             |
| 01:27:28   | without running out of fuel, though I should probably fill out before then.                               |
| 01:27:32   | My 3D printer isn't running, but if it were, it would tell me that the estimated time it                  |
| 01:27:35   | was going to finish, I can see all the lights that are on, any window shades that are open,               |
| 01:27:40   | what's up with the robot vacuum, if it needed emptying, or the water needed filling up for                |
| 01:27:46   | the mopping function.                                                                                     |
| 01:27:48   | I would see that ditto my dryer or my washer.                                                             |
| 01:27:52   | It would tell me if those needed emptying, and it's telling me my dishwasher does need                    |
| 01:27:56   | emptying, which is good, I'm glad to see that that's finished.                                            |
| 01:27:59   | And all of this information has been customised to be exactly what I need when I need it.                 |
| 01:28:06   | So if it's a day where I'm going to be in the office in Bristol because I'm working,                      |
| 01:28:11   | then it will show me when the train is leaving, because that's information that's important.              |
| 01:28:18   | And I've managed to customise that into a very personal home dashboard.                                   |
| 01:28:21   | And you don't have to go that whole hog and do all of that, but you can.                                  |
| 01:28:26   | You've got the option to do it.                                                                           |
| 01:28:27   | It has an energy dashboard, so if you integrate your energy supplier, an integrate could just             |
| 01:28:32   | be as simple as sign in to your energy supplier through [[Home Assistant]], then it can show you              |
| 01:28:37   | how much energy you're using.                                                                             |
| 01:28:39   | So I can see right now that I'm doing pretty good at not using electricity today, which                   |
| 01:28:44   | is good considering the prices, but yesterday was not such a great day.                                   |
| 01:28:49   | But I can actually see what's going on there.                                                             |
| 01:28:53   | And it's just a way to automate your home that is very much focused on if you can do                      |
| 01:28:59   | it locally, you should do it locally.                                                                     |
| 01:29:02   | So you don't want to be talking to a cloud before you talk to a device to control it.                     |
| 01:29:06   | Okay, well, see, I had thought it was just like a Rosetta Stone, and we'll let you talk                   |
| 01:29:10   | to anything, but it's more than that.                                                                     |
| 01:29:12   | Okay, it certainly is, but it's more than that.                                                           |
| 01:29:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                     |
| 01:29:16   | Okay.                                                                                                     |
| 01:29:17   | Well, mine ships, I just checked my email, they say I'm going to get it on November 4th.                  |
| 01:29:21   | So                                                                                                        |
| 01:29:22   | Lovely.                                                                                                   |
| 01:29:23   | Right about then.                                                                                         |
| 01:29:24   | I'm going to be playing with it.                                                                          |
| 01:29:25   | We'll talk about it.                                                                                      |
| 01:29:26   | Maybe we'll even do a show on it, depending on how far down the rabbit hole I go.                         |
| 01:29:28   | But Rose, thank you so much for walking me through because I feel like I have not gone                    |
| 01:29:34   | deep enough with [[HomeKit]] in some instances because it just didn't make sense in the past.                 |
| 01:29:39   | I'm definitely going to be sending some money to Aqara and maybe Hugh, and I'll be reporting              |
| 01:29:44   | back and I really hope the next time you and I sit down and record, I'll be in indoor studios             |
| 01:29:49   | with good lighting and sound and all those cool things.                                                   |
| 01:29:53   | Lovely.                                                                                                   |
| 01:29:54   | I can't wait for it.                                                                                      |
| 01:29:55   | I want to thank our sponsors today.                                                                       |

| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators. I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard. Hello,              |
| 00:07      | Rose. Hey, David. I am excited for today's guest because we've got the one, the only,                   |
| 00:14      | the amazing, Alex Cox is back. Howdy, howdy. Thank you so much for having me. I'm so,                   |
| 00:20      | so excited. Yeah, Alex, you are one of our favourite guests because,                                     |
| 00:24      | uh, how do I put this? You were living the struggle with us. Alex is, um, you know.                     |
| 00:32      | Yes. Yes. I mean, you're, you're automating stuff. I mean,                                              |
| 00:35      | as soon as we got on the prep call, you had like a list of like four questions of things                |
| 00:38      | you're trying to automate that you want. So we're going to cover some of that during the show.          |
| 00:42      | But, you know, the Automators is not meant to be a show for people who, you know, write [[Xcode]] every     |
| 00:48      | day for a living. Although Rose, I know you do that. Um, I mean, I don't usually use [[Xcode]].             |
| 00:54      | I write PHP, which is difficult to do an [[Xcode]]. I stand corrected. I stand corrected. But no,           |
| 01:01      | the reason the show exists is we want anybody out there to automate just like the chef said             |
| 01:06      | and ratatouille. Anybody can automate and, um, and, and Alex, you're on the journey with us. You        |
| 01:11      | got some cool stuff. You do, you're automating yourself. You're out there doing cool stuff,             |
| 01:14      | but you also got some questions and Rose and I are struggling with it, along with                       |
| 01:18      | you. So this is going to be a great show for anybody listening. We're going to give you some            |
| 01:21      | good automation tips. And, uh, if you're listening, the reason we dropped these shows on Fridays is     |
| 01:26      | cause we want you to spend the weekend going home and getting motivated and building some               |
| 01:31      | of your own automations. I like the way that it is really much. So we love you for listening to         |
| 01:36      | the show. By the way, here's the list of homework. Yeah. Insert like 500 page document. Um,             |
| 01:43      | accidentally, but done with love every time. But it works. We get emails from listeners all the time    |
| 01:48      | who figured out some cool automation that saves them time. And that's the whole point, right? I         |
| 01:53      | mean, we like computers, but we would rather be spending time playing with our dogs or kids in          |
| 01:58      | the garden, uh, watching TV, whatever it is that we like to do for fun. And, uh, automation can help    |
| 02:05      | you get there gang. So that's, that's right here. So Alex, Alex, one of the things that you do that     |
| 02:10      | I love is do by Friday. Uh, it's such a great podcast. I mean, I don't know who came up with            |
| 02:15      | the idea to pair you and Merlin Mann together, but it is, uh, you know, it's like peanut butter and      |
| 02:21      | jelly or it's like gasoline in a match. I'm not sure which one, but they either way, it's kind of       |
| 02:27      | awesome. Was this intended to be a compliment? I mean, that's exactly how I would describe it           |
| 02:33      | honestly because that's, that's pretty much it. All it took was me listening to Merlin Mann's shows      |
| 02:40      | for about a decade. Well, and including you David, I listened to Mac power users probably before        |
| 02:48      | any other show. I mean, maybe because you were, you were a show before                                  |
| 02:56      | your iTunes supported podcasts, right? Or am I mistaken? No, it was, it was there, but we were          |
| 03:04      | pretty early to the game, but that wasn't that. And then Rose came and then she became my favourite.     |
| 03:11      | And now I'm like, oh, the heck with all of these boys. Yeah, I'm sure you've been podcasting a          |
| 03:18      | lot longer than I am. Alex, I remember hearing about you such a long time ago. I'm thinking,            |
| 03:22      | darn, Alex, I was like, just such a cool person. I mean, I have been podcasting for as long as my       |
| 03:28      | curly. I am just not as popular. So for, and for good reason. But that's, that's such a compliment.     |
| 03:36      | Thank you, Rose. I was listening to my old automators episode. Actually, the, you were kind             |
| 03:44      | enough to have me on two years ago. And I just didn't want to repeat too much of what I had talked      |
| 03:51      | about before and realised, oh, you know what? I have with my automations kind of come not a long        |
| 03:59      | way, but as much as I would want to in that amount of time. So I think that just speaks to what David   |
| 04:06      | said, that even if you're hearing this and you just like to listen because you enjoy hearing            |
| 04:13      | David and Rose's Rosemary's voices, as I do, don't worry. There's still stuff to do. I am,              |
| 04:22      | I am, I still feel like a newbie and then realised, oh, grown a lot in two years. So that was kind      |
| 04:29      | of exciting. I gave myself a compliment. This is the first time on any show. Wow. Wow.                  |
| 04:36      | Congratulations, Alex. That is an achievement. And also, I'd just like to note, thinking that           |
| 04:41      | your automations have come a distance and you said not a long way, that might actually be a             |
| 04:47      | good thing in some ways. Because obviously, David and I are messing with this stuff all the time,       |
| 04:51      | because we're doing a podcast about automations. So we do have to push the limits to an extent          |
| 04:55      | and play with all the things. But things not having necessarily moved a lot and just improved,          |
| 05:01      | that's a sign that they're working. Exactly. My biggest problem is usually like, why is this            |
| 05:07      | not working? I had this just before we started the show today. I couldn't figure out why. I was         |
| 05:13      | asking my HomePod to set my office lights to 100%. They briefly go to 100% and then they just get      |
| 05:18      | dimmer and dimmer and dimmer. So spoiler, this weekend I was rearranging my office. Obviously,          |
| 05:23      | I've put one of the controls to adapt the lights in a box somewhere and something is resting on it      |
| 05:30      | and it's pressing the button. So I had to turn off that automation because                              |
| 05:36      | something somewhere is dimming my lights and I don't 100% know where it is right now.                   |
| 05:42      | That's going to be a fun one to fix. You know that you've grown as an                                   |
| 05:46      | automator when you realise that it could be something physical that is messing things up?               |
| 05:52      | Because just before we started recording, I'm like, oh, God, is my air conditioner still                |
| 05:57      | that loud? And went to just eventually go unplug it because my automation turned it off,                |
| 06:03      | didn't work, and then I saw a cat sitting on the button for it. So that was probably why.               |
| 06:10      | 50% of the time now, it used to be like only 10% of the time it was a cat messing up automations        |
| 06:17      | because we'll talk about it, but most of my automations are still in the real world,                    |
| 06:23      | quote, real world. But now about half the time it is a cat messing them up.                             |
| 06:29      | I think what I would just say that as a general rule, if you own a cat and you try to automate          |
| 06:36      | that the cat is going to mess it up about 10% of the time, just as a continuation of the                |
| 06:41      | psychological warfare between cats and humans. Exactly. I feel like I need to correct you,              |
| 06:46      | David, if you are owned by one or more cats. There you go. That is the correct phrasing                 |
| 06:51      | of the sentence. You don't own a cat. The cat graces you with that presence and chooses to own          |
| 06:56      | you. I'll speak as a dog person. Dogs don't mess up my automations. They just look at me sad            |
| 07:03      | when I'm trying to automate. I feel like I should remind you at the time that Ashoka was chewing        |
| 07:10      | on the flood sensor. That's right. She triggered the flood sensor because she was licking it.           |
| 07:15      | That's correct. Well, guys, dogs are in on it too, guys. Well, if any pets own you                      |
| 07:23      | and you have automation problems, you should look at them sideways. I really feel like they             |
| 07:30      | do like to mess with us a bit. That's one way to do it. Yeah, definitely. If you have a partner and     |
| 07:34      | anything goes wrong with your automation, always blame the pet. Always blame the pet. They will buy     |
| 07:39      | you so much leeway. Definitely recommend that tactic. Unless the pet is literally out at the            |
| 07:45      | house at the time that something goes wrong and there is absolutely no way that they could possibly     |
| 07:50      | have peed somewhere or put something somewhere that they shouldn't know that could be causing the       |
| 07:54      | issue. But yeah, blame the pets. Even if you've got a budgie or something, they are creative            |
| 08:00      | creatures. You can blame a budgie. I'm sure of it. Listen, if it can fart, then it can break            |
| 08:06      | an automation. If you're going to blame it. Everything buts can fart, apparently.                       |
| 08:11      | Oh, wow. This is a discussion that came up at work the other week. Don't ask me how stand up went       |
| 08:15      | out of the rails, but it did. This is what happens when the boss is out. Yeah, if it's not a sloth      |
| 08:22      | that can fart. I just had a little insight though. I was thinking, leak sensors actually could be       |
| 08:28      | quite useful when training dogs. You could put a leak sensor in the crate or wherever the dog           |
| 08:36      | stays and you would know when they peed. I never thought of it that way. Yeah, that is something        |
| 08:41      | I'm trying to set up for my brother who has just gotten a dog, actually. I believe a product that       |
| 08:48      | exists. Well, motion sensors exist, but the dog knows. There's basically a little accident area,        |
| 08:57      | we call it. The dog at least knows that if there's going to be an accident, he goes over there.         |
| 09:04      | There's a little motion sensor that works with [[HomeKit]]. Then he's like, my brother's like,              |
| 09:13      | oh, all right, I guess I got to go home and deal with that, but it prepares.                            |
| 09:18      | You could go a level deeper. You could get in a car leak sensor. They're about 15 bucks,                |
| 09:22      | but you'd have to also get in a car hub, by the way. If he got that, when it gets wet,                  |
| 09:29      | it would, he would get a, but the funny thing is the way it integrates with [[HomeKit]] is it goes off      |
| 09:34      | like there is actually a leak, like an alarm goes off. Everybody in the house hears it.                 |
| 09:39      | It comes through as a critical alert. It sings out on the HomePods. I'm using the word sing             |
| 09:43      | very generously here. It is loud. That is the only problem with that because also,                      |
| 09:50      | especially if there are HomePods involved and the dog hears it, then they're going to get like,         |
| 09:55      | I mean, this could be a good thing, right? The dog here like pees, then hears a sound and is like,      |
| 10:00      | oh no, I shouldn't have done that. At the same time, you don't want the dog to be terrified of          |
| 10:04      | going to the toilet. So yeah. It's like red alert, red alert, rover, let it, let it flow.               |
| 10:11      | I love that. That's something you may want to look into. Something which you mentioned                  |
| 10:17      | along those lines. And at some point, when we get to the next feedback show, I want to go into          |
| 10:21      | this deeper rows, but Aqara has done something cool because there's all these features with the         |
| 10:26      | Aqara hardware and Rose and I always have this asterisk. Well, Aqara cameras do this or Aqara           |
| 10:30      | sensors do that, but they don't talk to [[HomeKit]]. Well, now they've got a way to share workflows         |
| 10:35      | from the Aqara app to [[HomeKit]]. Have you seen those rows? It's a nice feature they've added              |
| 10:40      | recently with a software update. I don't want to get into it today because I need to do a little        |
| 10:45      | more prep on it. But if you've got Aqara sensors and you want to get some of those additional           |
| 10:50      | features into [[HomeKit]], it's actually easier now than it used to be. So yeah, I've seen that and         |
| 10:55      | I've also seen the SwitchBot appears to be doing something very similar as well with their              |
| 10:58      | [[Matter]]-based hub. So that's definitely something that we should look into because yeah, I've had       |
| 11:03      | some questions come in about that recently. Oh, that's so cool. I look forward to that show.            |
| 11:08      | Alex, you got to find Aqara in your life if you're doing a home automation. It's just so great.         |
| 11:13      | But you had said earlier, I'm not going to let you get away with this. You said that you had            |
| 11:17      | grown as an automator. Tell us a little bit about that. What are the automations and platforms that     |
| 11:24      | you have found yourself gravitating to in the last two years? I have finally been using a               |
| 11:31      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] to do what I want it to do and actually put my windows where I want them to go         |
| 11:42      | and for things like podcast editing or podcast recording, just setting that up was really               |
| 11:53      | intimidating. But between the two of you and [[Jason Snell]], I think I've finally gotten it to work.       |
| 12:04      | And that has been phenomenal because I absolutely adore iOS. It is my main and I talked about this      |
| 12:15      | one last show. iOS is basically my main operating system. Secondary to that is Mac OS. And like         |
| 12:24      | a lot of people, actually [[Jason Snell]] talked about this on Six Colours a couple of days ago,             |
| 12:31      | so like a lot of folks, I tried to make my iPad a primary traveling computer for a very long time       |
| 12:39      | and really enjoyed being able to have just that really kind of stark focus with one or two apps         |
| 12:50      | and sometimes barely focus, barely working focus modes. But now I know this may make some people        |
| 12:59      | cringe. I have my Mac set up like a really, really fancy iPad that I would want. I just kind of wanted  |
| 13:07      | to make my Mac into what I would want an iPad to have. And because now it's kind of like the surface    |
| 13:16      | of Mac OS for me is what I would like is iOS. And then if I want to drill deeper, if I really           |
| 13:25      | need to go into like something like God forbid Vim, which has only happened once, I can do that.        |
| 13:36      | But I can have these really powerful applications exactly where I want them to be and doing the         |
| 13:44      | exact things I want. For example, there is this certain thing in the logic where I can't put any        |
| 13:53      | keyboard shortcut for it. It's not meant to be used that often because logic is an application          |
| 14:03      | for musicians, not podcasters. And a lot of us struggle with that. So I just needed something           |
| 14:12      | to always open stripped silence, which is what you use when you are editing a podcast and you           |
| 14:19      | want to eliminate the silent parts on different tracks. So it's just easier overall to kind of          |
| 14:30      | splice it together. But there was just no way to open that setting and then change it to the exact      |
| 14:40      | sort of threshold. I know that this is nonsense to some people, I apologise.                            |
| 14:46      | No, it makes sense. You're trying to run a command and it doesn't have automation for that.             |
| 14:51      | And I just needed to click a bunch of little buttons and I couldn't do that until I set up              |
| 15:00      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] with my Stream Deck and now it works. And I should have done it a long time ago,       |
| 15:08      | but it's there now and I'm grateful for it. So you're telling me that Alex is using keyboard            |
| 15:15      | maestro doing setups and contextual computing with automation? Are you gaslighting me? Are you          |
| 15:22      | just trying to get me all excited? I mean, what's going on here? I mean, I heard the magic focus        |
| 15:27      | modes in there as well, David. Yes, I mean, it's like a trifecta. I mean, I wanted to                   |
| 15:34      | sort of save it for the show, but I know how much you like contextual both of us really like            |
| 15:40      | contextual computing. And that's why I have my Mac setup setup like this, because there's just          |
| 15:49      | too much cognitive load for me to or there there isn't too much technically. But I think of my brain    |
| 16:01      | as a computer. And I want to use as little RAM as possible on things that don't don't need it,          |
| 16:13      | so that I can do, I can use the rest of the RAM for things I can't automate, like                       |
| 16:20      | thinking up silly ideas or doing stuff with my family or friends. So, and obviously,                    |
| 16:29      | that is what automating is all about. And with my, and it's not just on my computer, I mentioned        |
| 16:38      | a little bit before about how most of my automations are also like physically based. And I'm still      |
| 16:49      | using shortcuts with NFC tags to run pretty much everything in my apartment. I've got little            |
| 17:01      | stickers set up by my desk in my kitchen in my living room, both where I sit for                        |
| 17:11      | like couch like TV time and a place for reading. And each of those NFC tags triggers a focus mode       |
| 17:24      | to change my home screen or and or start playing something on a HomePod and change the lights          |
| 17:34      | just so I can get in to both literally the focus mode on iOS, but also in my with my own brain.         |
| 17:45      | It's easier for me to be like, okay, now it is, it's like a side by brain goes to hopefully it's        |
| 17:52      | like a solid state drive. Now, it doesn't take as long to to decompress from work or it doesn't         |
| 17:59      | take as long to, you know, go from relaxing to getting stuff going out of the house. And                |
| 18:10      | because I also live in such a small space because I'm in Chicago that and I can't really like when      |
| 18:18      | I say rooms, that's very generous. Now when I suppose it's more like vague areas. So to define          |
| 18:28      | that I kind of do it by lights and those different contexts. And I haven't gotten to the point where    |
| 18:37      | I only work on certain projects in certain places. But I'm kind of almost there because,                |
| 18:43      | you know, blue versus green versus purple lights really makes my brain function in different ways.      |
| 18:50      | And I love that. I know it's not for everybody. This episode of Automators is brought to you by         |

| 20:16      | show and all of Relay FM. All right. Before the break, you were talking about your brain getting        |
| 20:24      | upgraded to an SSD. I have the opposite problem. I've come to acknowledge that my brain is more         |
| 20:29      | on the basic abacus level of compute and the automation and all the stuff I do is ways to help          |
| 20:36      | me make an abacus do more than it should. So we're both... Well, that's the thing. You're adding        |
| 20:43      | more rows and more beads. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Before I was on, you know, like a i-book sort of         |
| 20:54      | thing and then hopefully I kind of went to a power book and now, you know, with Silicon                 |
| 21:02      | Max and my M2, my brain is at the hard drive levels that each of those had and the RAM                  |
| 21:12      | amount, or at least I hope anyway. There's a Latin saying, materiam superabat opus[^1], which means the     |
| 21:22      | basically the collection is greater than the parts. And I've decided that's my life's dream,            |
| 21:27      | that when they put me in the ground, they'll say, well, he wasn't really that smart,                    |
| 21:31      | but he did some pretty good stuff with what he had, you know. And I think automation plays a role       |
| 21:37      | there. And, you know, so you mentioned [[Keyboard Maestro]] and screen setups and I will not ever           |
| 21:45      | pass up an excuse to talk about that because I think anybody listening to this should consider          |
| 21:50      | this. And the idea is using some automation tool to set your computer up to do the kinds of work        |
| 21:56      | you need to do in the best circumstances. So it sounds like you've been playing with that.              |
| 22:01      | What are you doing and how's it working? Well, I had tried to use [[Keyboard Maestro]] a little bit         |
| 22:11      | before and used your wonderful MacSparky Fields Guide, I believe, was how I wasn't introduced          |
| 22:20      | to it. But when I was like, all right, I should, I should like actually sort of like get down to        |
| 22:28      | the bones with this. That actually still hasn't happened very, very much. Mostly I kind of am           |
| 22:36      | still doing the thing where it is a surface, I don't want to say surface level, but the main            |
| 22:44      | thing is using scripts to, like I said, put windows in certain things like it will and using triggers   |
| 22:55      | like see, I'm trying to look because previous, I do have an [[Obsidian]]. Also, David, this is a thing      |
| 23:06      | that we both do. It's called CoxOS. And it's just kind of all of my, yeah, it's like all of my,         |
| 23:14      | it's all my like medication stuff, all of like the apart, there's also a section for like everything    |
| 23:21      | that runs in my apartment for if a guest needs to come over. But and I probably should have that        |
| 23:28      | with [[Keyboard Maestro]] too is like my own little read me to re set stuff up when it breaks. Because      |
| 23:37      | I mentioned before the show how I basically quit another job because in 2020, when last we talked,      |
| 23:47      | I was working at a company at Cards Against Humanity here in Chicago as the studio and events           |
| 23:54      | manager. But then in 2020, this thing happened where people really didn't want to be confined           |
| 24:01      | into a studio place, like having eight people there, not the best. Also, running big events in          |
| 24:08      | an office when that office no longer exists, not really a thing. So all of my automations               |
| 24:15      | based around that went out the window. And then I started doing freelance work with consulting on       |
| 24:25      | events, also consulting on just setting up a workflow for your like really if someone had a             |
| 24:35      | really small team, I would set them up. If they didn't have an IT person, I would just kind of be       |
| 24:42      | their go to. And I did a bunch of that for a year. And didn't I don't want to say didn't enjoy it.      |
| 24:52      | But there were so many little things that I had to work around all of my clients in order to do         |
| 25:04      | the specific thing they wanted, even though, you know, it wasn't the best way, which is fine. Like      |
| 25:11      | if you are working for someone, that is what you should do. But they should also pay you. And           |
| 25:19      | sometimes, you know, when you're freelancing, people just disappear. And that was something             |
| 25:24      | that I had never experienced until that. So and I'm like, you know, at all of my automations,           |
| 25:31      | all the things that make me incredibly fast at working, if I am just doing things for myself,           |
| 25:42      | aka just podcasting, none of this would would break. So what I am doing, I finally now this             |
| 25:51      | the past week, [[Keyboard Maestro]] is the only thing it does is right now is set windows and               |
| 26:00      | click certain buttons in logic for me. And the reason I'm able to finally do that is                    |
| 26:06      | I can just run my MacBook Air in clamshell mode. And I don't need to worry about things being           |
| 26:16      | pixel perfect anymore, because it's automatically set up that way. But before I would accidentally      |
| 26:23      | delete a complete track or something with [[Keyboard Maestro]], I'm also Oh, sorry, I'm                     |
| 26:32      | also using a Stream Deck to run the keyboard, a lot of that stuff in yeah, to run those scripts.        |
| 26:42      | Although I have to say, as I learn more about [[Keyboard Maestro]], I'm realising more and more             |
| 26:51      | each year, along with certain, certain [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]], shortcuts can do just like more and               |
| 26:58      | more of it. And whenever I go to like Google something, I don't understand it turns out                 |
| 27:06      | someone's like, Well, actually, you can do this just with shortcuts natively. And so that is very       |
| 27:13      | exciting. But for the tiny little pixel perfect things, a [[Keyboard Maestro]] is absolutely magic.         |
| 27:21      | I think their icon Yeah, oh, yep, there's their icon has a little, a little magic wand.                 |
| 27:28      | Do you have a favourite thing, David for [[Keyboard Maestro]]? Like, is there what do you think I            |
| 27:33      | should be doing with [[Keyboard Maestro]] to even expand my musical automation palette with that            |
| 27:40      | specifically? All right. So setups, you know, the idea of setting your screen up to do your edits       |
| 27:45      | or whatever it is work project you want to do. You have done the first building block and that's        |
| 27:51      | setting windows because I feel like for most people, that's the biggest part, like you sit down         |
| 27:56      | at your computer and Safari is open to Amazon, but you need to make, you know, write the report,        |
| 28:02      | edit the podcast, whatever it is you do to pay for your shoes. What if you could hit a magical          |
| 28:06      | button and Amazon went away and the editing software came up and the windows were just the              |
| 28:11      | way you like them. So you can feel like you're in the space to do the work.                             |
| 28:17      | Keyboard maestro is fine for that. And but the thing is, it's additive as you build that,               |
| 28:23      | now you've got it. So you can duplicate that and say, well, now what about when I want to do email      |
| 28:28      | while you go and you change the name of the apps, it doesn't open logic, it opens your mail app and     |
| 28:32      | it maybe sets it a little differently. But once you start building these, they become super easy        |
| 28:39      | to make additional ones, you know, and then it's just a question of deciding, well, how much do         |
| 28:43      | you want it to do? Now, historically, I always did them in [[Keyboard Maestro]], but somebody in the        |
| 28:49      | MacSparky Labs challenged me to do them in shortcuts. And honestly, I can do it in shortcuts           |
| 28:54      | just as easily because shortcuts has got powerful enough. And the window management piece of it         |
| 29:00      | was always the tricky part. The shortcuts window management can't hold a candle to                      |
| 29:04      | to [[Keyboard Maestro]]. But what shortcuts can do is run an AppleScript. And there's an app called        |
| 29:09      | [[Moom]], M-O-O-M. I'm going to give you a labs video where I explain it. [[Moom]] has AppleScript support.    |
| 29:16      | So you can set up the windows exactly as you want with [[Moom]]. And then you can run a one step            |
| 29:21      | shortcut that says, run my [[Moom]] view for editing podcasts. And they'll say, Oh, great, Alex, no         |
| 29:29      | problem. Here's logic. Here's your text edit. Here's your notes. Here's your whatever. And              |
| 29:34      | it just does it for you. So you can set up very complex windows out of shortcuts. And what shortcuts    |
| 29:41      | gives you is the ability to do things like, Oh, you want me to set your focus mode to editing?          |
| 29:46      | Sure, I'll do that too. Do you want me to run a timer in the timing app? Yeah, I got you covered.       |
| 29:52      | You know, do you want me to play the white noise app in the background? So, so shortcuts does some      |
| 29:57      | things that [[Keyboard Maestro]] doesn't. And so then people are saying, well, should I switch them all     |
| 30:02      | to shortcuts? I'm like, no, not necessarily. If you like it and [[Keyboard Maestro]], just keep doing it.   |
| 30:06      | Because now [[Keyboard Maestro]] can run shortcuts actions. So if you want to stick with keyboard           |
| 30:12      | maestro, then just run the [[Keyboard Maestro]] action to run the shortcut to set the focus mode. So        |
| 30:18      | we live in this, I keep calling it this golden age of Mac automation, because suddenly we've got        |
| 30:23      | these rich tools like shortcuts and [[Keyboard Maestro]] and [[Hazel]] and all these things are like            |
| 30:28      | at their peak. And they all talk to each other. So whichever one you want to fight you on that,         |
| 30:35      | David, I don't think we are living in a golden age of Mac automation. That was in, you know, the sort   |
| 30:42      | of, uh, well, I was going to say that was the cells to go in days, but he's still just killing it       |
| 30:49      | with especially what he's doing with voiceover. But we are in a golden age of Apple automation,         |
| 30:57      | because so much can finally talk to each other in a way that adds to that contextual computing.         |
| 31:08      | So for the weirdos like me who want to run everything on iOS, it works now. Like I can                  |
| 31:15      | trigger keyboard, I guess I can trigger [[Keyboard Maestro]] things from my phone. If I were to a           |
| 31:24      | remote, uh, like let's say I mentioned before the show, I have a separate Mac. If I want,               |
| 31:30      | if that's on, I guess I could probably maybe run it with shorter push, Pushcut that's in              |
| 31:38      | the care of Rosemary or George or so. We're gonna unleash Rose on push cut for you in just a minute     |
| 31:43      | here. But one way you could do it is you can have [[Keyboard Maestro]], you can have basically a secret     |
| 31:48      | URL. So you could call that URL from your phone and then it would trigger [[Keyboard Maestro]] on your      |
| 31:54      | second computer and do all that stuff for you. Yeah, that's that's what I was thinking, because I       |
| 32:00      | also use, well for launching the apps, I for a while had a mix of a bunch actions too with a            |
| 32:13      | [[Brett Terpstra]], which is what I would use on my laptop when I couldn't be, when I can't be in          |
| 32:21      | clamshell mode. Mostly, I know that you can do it with [[Keyboard Maestro]], but it was one of the          |
| 32:27      | things where it worked. And if it didn't, I could text Brett and say, what am I doing wrong?            |
| 32:33      | And you'd be like, here, here's the right script that you need to run it.                               |
| 32:38      | And in fairness, that thing I just described, you could do the entire thing in bunch,                   |
| 32:42      | because bunch can make shortcuts and it can run AppleScript. So you really get to choose your          |
| 32:48      | weapon. Yeah. And the other thing is, I'm pretty certain the bunch docs are where David found the       |
| 32:52      | AppleScript for [[Moom]] as well to run [[Moom]] to set the screen. The other thing I want to mention,         |
| 32:59      | by the way, about [[Moom]] is what you do with [[Moom]] is you click on the [[Moom]] menu bar icon,                 |
| 33:06      | and then you just click on save window layout snapshot. So like you put your windows where              |
| 33:10      | you want them, and then you're just like, just save it. Like, just save what I've got. Like,            |
| 33:15      | give it a name down. That's it. Like, bam. And then, yeah, that's it. Done. And then it's also          |
| 33:22      | got the, like, if you hover over the full screen icon, then it's got like, expand this to the full      |
| 33:31      | size of the current screen, but not like full screen. It's got put it over on the left side,            |
| 33:36      | put it over on the right side, put it on the top half, put it on the bottom half. And then at the       |
| 33:40      | bottom, it's got a rectangle. And you can also change this to use hexagons, which are the best          |
| 33:44      | icons. But then if you click on that little rectangle, then you can just like, select an area           |
| 33:49      | of your screen, and it kind of like, drags out like, LEGO bricks almost. And, and, and like,           |
| 33:56      | then, then it'll just snap the window that you've just, you've just changed the size of to that,        |
| 34:01      | exactly that. And then there's like, other options within there inside of that for like,                |
| 34:06      | move it to like, I've got an ultra wide monitor. So I've got things like, move it to the right          |
| 34:09      | hand third of my screen, and stuff like that. There's just so much you can do with [[Moom]]. It is          |
| 34:14      | truly crazy. And it's one of those things like, I can absolutely resize a window using something        |
| 34:20      | like cable maestro. cable maestro is a great app to use for resizing windows, if that's the app         |
| 34:24      | you're already using, and that's what you're used to and so on. But if I just want to, if somebody      |
| 34:28      | wants a recommendation for an app, that's going to like, move windows on their screen. I'm just         |
| 34:33      | going to tell them to try [[Moom]], because it's very, very easy to like, get into. And that, that menu     |
| 34:39      | bar save window layout snapshot, it's just so powerful. It makes it really, really easy to dive         |
| 34:45      | into. So you know what, Rose? I bet even if for some reason, a person is bonkers and was like,          |
| 34:54      | no, I'm going to do, that's dumb. I'm going to do my own thing. But I just went to the app store        |
| 35:03      | for [[Moom]]. And guess what? There's an app story that's clean up your windows. And what they              |
| 35:10      | suggest is, is [[Moom]] and a couple, a couple other tools. And basically, they teach you how to do         |
| 35:17      | this in, just in the basically, it's not an ad, but, you know, little app, yeah, featurette,            |
| 35:26      | which is another reason that I am excited about, like Apple just showing off what's essentially         |
| 35:33      | an automation. And it's even more accessible. That's wild. I am so stoked about that. Well,             |
| 35:42      | I'm very excited.                                                                                       |
| 35:43      | It's another one they mentioned there and better snap tool, which is built into [[BetterTouchTool]].      |
| 35:49      | If you've got that, yeah, there's, there's a whole bunch of different options for this stuff.           |
| 35:53      | I personally just like [[Moom]], it works really, really well for me. It's silly easy to use,               |
| 35:59      | I'm going to say, like, it took me a little while to figure out, like, how do I calculate one third     |
| 36:03      | of my screen? I was like, it doesn't matter exactly how I calculate it. I just need to get              |
| 36:08      | it about right. And then I can always adjust this over time. But yeah, there's a bunch of options.      |
| 36:13      | I found that story, by the way, from the app store, and I'll put a link in the show notes. And          |
| 36:17      | from what I remember that link, even if you don't have a Mac, should open on iOS as well,               |
| 36:21      | so that you can have a look at that. I have always been curious about the, like, what would happen      |
| 36:31      | with window management on the Mac when, let's say, a theoretical headset would come out. I'm like,      |
| 36:41      | okay, Apple's going to care a lot about window management eventually. And obviously, stage              |
| 36:49      | manager is what that was. But I'm so glad to see they are embracing the use of third-party apps         |
| 36:57      | still. And that also makes me excited for the possibilities for visionOS eventually,                    |
| 37:04      | which I know is later down on the document. Y'all are so organised with this.                           |
| 37:10      | I mean, I mentioned this to you when we were talking pre-show Alex, like,                               |
| 37:15      | our show outline is more of a sort of rough guideline of, here's a couple of markers,                   |
| 37:20      | let's try and hit them at some point. But it's like one of those adventure runs where it's like,        |
| 37:24      | your aim is to hit all the markers and then go to the finish line, but                                  |
| 37:28      | like, there's no order required. So that you need to do.                                                |
| 37:34      | It's fine. If we end up with too many side quests, we'll just get you back in a couple of months         |
| 37:39      | and continue talking about all this. I mean, just one last point on [[Moom]], though,                       |
| 37:43      | as people do write me and say, well, you know, this other one does this or that,                        |
| 37:46      | and, you know, but I just find it really hard to not recommend [[Moom]] because                             |
| 37:53      | the combination, it has so many window management features built in. And then                           |
| 37:57      | the ease of you saving a set up windows like Rose was talking about, and then the ease of               |
| 38:02      | triggering it via AppleScript. It's just such a killer combination. I just don't know how you          |
| 38:07      | not use that. And it, Rose is right. Like setting it up in [[Keyboard Maestro]], as much as I'm a           |
| 38:13      | fan of [[Keyboard Maestro]], it is a thing where you have to set a percentage or you have to set a pixel    |
| 38:18      | location. But what if you change your screen display or whatever? And [[Moom]] just kind of solves          |
| 38:25      | that for you. And then you can drop it into any automation platform. You can put it in,                 |
| 38:30      | you know, you put it in bunch, you can put it in shortcuts, you can use in [[Keyboard Maestro]].            |
| 38:33      | It doesn't matter. And then it just gives you, but, but, and then the big point I want to make          |
| 38:38      | before we move on is you've started it. You've got, even if you just have one, you've, you're           |
| 38:44      | like 75% of the journey just by getting one, because now it gets super easy. And then you're            |
| 38:50      | going to find yourself saying, Oh, you know, what about when I want to, you know, do ad recording?      |
| 38:57      | Or what about when I want to set up a new client project or whatever it is that you need to do          |
| 39:01      | next? No, no client projects, David. No, as I said, the words, I almost like suck them back in.         |
| 39:07      | I know you don't want to do that, but, but somebody listening might. And, and the point is              |
| 39:11      | whatever it is that you want to do next, once you've built the structure, you duplicate it,             |
| 39:16      | you change a few things, and then you've got it, you know, and then the last piece of these             |
| 39:21      | setups is having an easy way to trigger them. And you had said that you were doing it with a            |
| 39:26      | Stream Deck, which is great. Like [[Keyboard Maestro]], you know, you set up a button, run a keyboard       |
| 39:32      | maestro script, you can do the same thing with shortcuts or a bunch. But, you know,                     |
| 39:36      | making triggers on a Stream Deck is great. If you're using [[Keyboard Maestro]], a conflict                 |
| 39:40      | palette can work. There's, there's a lot of different ways. But as you start getting into               |
| 39:43      | this, you should think about, well, how do I want to trigger these? And what's the easiest way          |
| 39:47      | for me to jump between them? Yeah, I didn't even mention [[Alfred]] and [[Raycast]], which                      |
| 39:53      | I also both see you use. [[Raycast]] is awesome and it runs shortcuts right out of a box. Yeah.             |
| 40:00      | Oh, so cool. Yeah, before we move on from [[Moom]], I do just want to mention that [[Moom]] also has            |
| 40:04      | built-in triggers, because of course we love automation apps. [[Moom]] has an option to trigger             |
| 40:09      | automatically when switching to the card, like your display layout matching like something in           |
| 40:15      | particular. So if you connect like one monitor that's got say 3,440 by 1,440 pixels and one             |
| 40:23      | that's 2,560 by 1,440, then it can automatically like rearrange your windows when you connect to        |
| 40:30      | that display layout, which is great for something like a laptop that you would dock and then undock     |
| 40:36      | even if like, if you're not using it in clamshell mode, if you're using it in an open mode,             |
| 40:40      | which is what I do with my machine. And it's just so nice that it can just be like,                     |
| 40:44      | hey, I can tell that you have done this. I'm just going to rearrange your windows for you,              |
| 40:48      | because that's what you told me to do. And it's got keyboard shortcuts and stuff built in as well       |
| 40:53      | that you can set up for each of your rearrangements. So yeah, it's really good.                         |

| 43:19      | Alex, you teased us NFC tags. You said you've got NFC tags everywhere. You've got stickers.             |
| 43:27      | I've got NFC plastic chips and card-type chips that I've put in a bunch of places because               |
| 43:36      | I've stuck them to my vitamin box and so on, so that when I type my vitamins,                           |
| 43:39      | I can tap my phone on it and be like, I've taken my vitamins. Now, I don't need to think about it       |
| 43:43      | because Shortcuts magically goes up and does the work. You mentioned there's focus modes involved       |
| 43:48      | here, this background noise. What happens when your phone scans an NFC tag? What do they look like?     |
| 43:53      | Are they just white or black stickers? Have you got pretty patterns on them? What's going on with       |
| 43:58      | these?                                                                                                  |
| 43:59      | Vitamins.                                                                                               |
| 44:03      | Okay, vitamins for the Americans. I'm sorry.                                                            |
| 44:06      | Well, back when I was in university, actually, I was going to say the biggest struggle I have had       |
| 44:15      | with NFC tags is finding some that don't break. I guess the best luck I've had is with the              |
| 44:27      | SwitchBot stickers. Those are on Amazon. They're a bit more expensive than the stickers that you        |
| 44:35      | can buy for $3. There's like 80 of these little stickers, but what I use, I guess they're almost        |
| 44:47      | like cardstock a little bit. They used to be very colourful when I had each of my contexts               |
| 45:01      | or focus modes. They are based around a certain colour. Let's just say my spouse thought they            |
| 45:11      | were a bit garish. Now they are all white and my muscle memory and having them long enough,             |
| 45:19      | I don't really need them labeled. Every morning when I am in my bathroom, I just slap my phone          |
| 45:29      | on the mirror and that triggers my wake up NFC. I know that you can run an automatic shortcut to        |
| 45:41      | automate something directly in shortcuts to turn on your lights, turn on the music, and                 |
| 45:47      | do the alarm, all of that stuff. My problem was I would talk to the Apple lady and then fall back       |
| 45:59      | to sleep even though all of the lights would be on and music was on. That's why I have a sticker.       |
| 46:06      | Like after my alarm goes off, I need to tap that phone to the NFC tag to it turns all of the            |
| 46:17      | lights from this garish wake up colour. I do all of this with hue lights and shortcuts with home         |
| 46:27      | kit. I know that some people don't like hue but it's just always worked for me. They have simple        |
| 46:37      | physical switches as well and that's one thing my spouse does like. They don't need to use the NFCs     |
| 46:44      | to control the lights. In the morning it starts my toothbrush timer and the lights on turns my          |
| 46:56      | music on and sets a timer for all that. In 30 minutes, all of that shuts down very abruptly.            |
| 47:06      | The music stops. The lights in my apartment turn blue so that it's like, okay, it is work mode.         |
| 47:16      | When I say blue, I mean the one that mimics sunlight theoretically. Oh yeah, like that cold white       |
| 47:26      | blue. Yeah. It's not the most pleasant thing but it's just to be like, okay, now is the time to         |
| 47:37      | if you've been messing around, you only need 30 minutes to get ready, change things. If for some        |
| 47:45      | reason I need to go in and stop an automation, that just mucks everything up. In order to not get       |
| 47:55      | into the muck, it motivates me to get up and do those things and it migrates perfectly to               |
| 48:03      | chunking blocks of time for working. That motivates me when an automation will break.                   |
| 48:19      | I don't enjoy that. Maybe someone has a weird special thing where they're like, yes, my shortcut        |
| 48:27      | broke but I'm not that person. I try to basically think of those NFC tags as an extension of my         |
| 48:38      | brain of like, all right, if I am tapping this button, it is tapping a part of my brain. I just         |
| 48:46      | try to imagine that it's like, okay, that is that light change. Your brain did that. I know             |
| 48:54      | this sounds like bunkers but yeah, so it's bathroom and then I sit at my desk and then tap              |
| 49:02      | another NFC tag. This is a question. Well, I think I will be able to answer this question               |
| 49:10      | myself. Since I run shortcuts via NFC tag, would I be able to trigger that shortcut and it also         |
| 49:29      | talks to my muck and arranges it in a certain way? Oh my gosh, I'm so happy. In theory, I could         |
| 49:37      | just hit a button on my Stream Deck. That's what I do now to set everything up. First thing in the      |
| 49:47      | morning is whatever I want to do least. It opens up a specific OmniFocus context in the                 |
| 50:01      | not context. A perspective that is a list of things I want to do least. It has a naughty word           |
| 50:12      | as the tag. So let's just say the things I want to do least. It pops up in the corner and my email      |
| 50:21      | opens, [[Drafts]] opens, a Google doc. Well, it used to be whatever the current project was for a client    |
| 50:31      | I was working on would open and that would then I just sit for however long and then middle of          |
| 50:43      | the day I go to like take a quick break and then I run I go to my kitchen and run another NFC tag       |
| 50:52      | that is pretty basic. It changes the lights to like normal, but it will also run a I have               |
| 51:03      | a switch bot mechanical thing. I don't know. I don't have anything that can open.                       |
| 51:11      | Yeah, yeah, a button presser that will make me an afternoon espresso and it also opens                  |
| 51:17      | the blinds or the curtains. I don't have a fancy like IKEA thing that will do it automatically.         |
| 51:26      | I have a physical thing that like latches on to the pole that we had to install over the window.        |
| 51:33      | My flat. I love British English so much. We should adopt it. Yours should be the correct                |
| 51:44      | the like canonical thing. It's funny because I am trying I'm like opening CoxOS and looking             |
| 51:53      | at this because so much of this now is just ingrained in my brain. Like all right, my afternoon         |
| 51:58      | break is done and then I go I come back to my desk and I have a separate NFC tag I could probably       |
| 52:06      | now I realise no that that is too much. I was about to say like I wonder if I can run a shortcut        |
| 52:13      | and that context depending on the time it would change and I would only need one shortcut but           |
| 52:20      | I don't know if that would work and I probably shouldn't do it. Well, what you could do is              |
| 52:26      | you could log inside or using shortcuts when you run the shortcut in the morning                        |
| 52:33      | or tell you, well, let's start with in the bathroom in the morning,                                     |
| 52:36      | like when you when you tap your NFC tag there, it could reset a variable in Data Jar,                   |
| 52:42      | which is like Alex's day progress or something like that. I don't know. Whatever you want to            |
| 52:46      | call it, you know, whatever is appropriate for you. And then when you go and you tap the NFC tag        |
| 52:52      | at your desk, then it'll say, okay, Alex's day has progressed to one. You know, just I'm using          |
| 52:58      | numbers here for the sake of simplicity, but you could say like morning, morning work or whatever.      |
| 53:04      | And then if you tap it again, like the first thing that you could do is have the have the               |
| 53:08      | shortcut check this and say, okay, what is this? Oh, I already did morning work. Well,                  |
| 53:14      | in that case, I'm now going to turn on afternoon work. But if you haven't done morning work,            |
| 53:18      | then it will run the morning work one. So for example, if I don't know, you fly back from               |
| 53:23      | somewhere and you sleep late, as you don't get up until later in the day and you don't start            |
| 53:27      | working until like two or something. Then when you tap it, it'll be like, I'll just do the morning      |
| 53:31      | work one because, you know, that's that's well, that's nothing's happened yet. So yeah, like            |
| 53:36      | if you did something like that, you could use Data Jar, you could use global variables into             |
| 53:40      | books pro, you know, there's a number of different options for that. But, you know,                     |
| 53:44      | you could definitely do that. And to go back to your question about triggering stuff on the Mac,        |
| 53:49      | [[Keyboard Maestro]] has like URLs that you can use to trigger stuff. So you can just use a get             |
| 53:54      | contents of URL with the [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro URL. Oh, yeah. The only thing I'll say about that       |
| 54:00      | is I have used this before, and I stopped using it not because it didn't work. It works. If your Mac    |
| 54:06      | is on, if your Mac however, is asleep, and password protected, guess what? Yeah, [[Keyboard Maestro]]       |
| 54:13      | macro URL can't do a lot because your Mac is asleep. So you're there going computer, do the             |
| 54:18      | magic thing. You just like, yeah, that's snoring sounds. But if you've got an extra Mac around,         |
| 54:25      | like you do Alex, that might be a great use for you, you know, to keep it running. It's kind of a       |
| 54:29      | background server. Before we move on, one modification to your workflow I wanted to add.                |
| 54:35      | If you look in the show notes, I put a link in there for you. And this is something I'm                 |
| 54:41      | literally tempted to just buy it and send it to you because I just want to hear the story of this.      |
| 54:47      | But they make a little device called the Clocky running alarm clock. And this is a robot. So            |
| 54:54      | it's automation. And what it does is it sits on your nightstand, but it's an alarm clock with two       |
| 54:59      | wheels on it. And when the morning, when the alarm goes off, if you don't turn it off fast enough,      |
| 55:05      | it jumps off your nightstand and races around the room and hides itself and it keeps ringing until      |
| 55:11      | you find it. Oh my goodness. David, I feel like this works better for people who own a house            |
| 55:15      | instead of somebody who lives in a very small area. No, I think it's even better in a small area.       |
| 55:19      | It's just like, can you just imagine something like running under the bed and it's got the QR,          |
| 55:24      | you put the QR sticker on the back of it, right? Put the QR sticker on the back                         |
| 55:28      | and just, just chase it around with your phone. Like you're running around the phone                    |
| 55:32      | in your pajamas saying, come back. I feel like this is like, well, there's things where like,           |
| 55:36      | you have to like go to the kitchen and then like scan an NOC tag and that presents like a maths         |
| 55:40      | puzzle for you to solve. And if you get it wrong, then it doesn't produce your morning coffee until     |
| 55:44      | you get it right. If you're there crying, what is two times seven? I can't do two times seven without   |
| 55:49      | coffee. There used to be a Gmail feature that was that. It was great. Yeah, I think, I think Alex,      |
| 55:56      | this could really work. And, but they make another one with like a little propeller on it and it        |
| 56:00      | takes off and flies around the room. And then the alarm won't stop ringing until you retrieve the       |
| 56:05      | propeller and return it to the clock. So that's another option. Are you serious? Yes. I have            |
| 56:11      | like, I had a little doll as a kid where it would go into like a thing and you pull like a cord on      |
| 56:16      | it and like the doll would like spin out and like fly off somewhere and you'd free forever,             |
| 56:20      | chase it over the car. It reminds me of that. This, I think, you know, I have a show that is            |
| 56:27      | not just about robots, but, but we, we talk about robots a lot. If this feels like something            |
| 56:33      | that I can expense to, to do a weird. S-Royce, this is not a counting advice. Please contact your       |
| 56:41      | accountants. Chase in your clocks around the house. Yeah, I can see that. Yes. This is,                 |
| 56:46      | this looks amazing. My gosh. But the automator angles, you have to put your QR sticker on the           |
| 56:52      | back of it. So yeah, the NRC sticker goes on the back of it. And so it's only when you found it.        |
| 56:57      | That you can scan it. Yeah. I've, I've also found actually the new, there, there was something          |
| 57:07      | with the iPhone 12 pro that NFC tags failed for me a lot, but I haven't had that issue anymore,         |
| 57:16      | which is. The radio got better. I heard that too for people. Yeah. Oh, okay. Good. Good. Cool. Yeah.    |
| 57:23      | I mean, it's one of those things where, you know, a lot of people think that you need to like touch     |
| 57:28      | the NRC tag to like your device and, and you don't, it's like there's a little scanner, essentially,    |
| 57:33      | it's like, it's right next to the camera on the back of your phone. It's not like inside the camera,    |
| 57:41      | it's just next to it, but like it should be able to scan it from like a centimeter, two centimeters     |
| 57:47      | away, like half an inch away from the NRC tag. So yeah, you don't actually have to like touch           |
| 57:52      | it to it. And if you have to touch it to it, that might be a sign that the NRC tag is actually          |
| 57:56      | broken, which is one of the reasons why I switched to like the plastic chip and card varieties,         |
| 58:01      | rather than stickers, because I can use like either a glue gun, or some like blue tech,                 |
| 58:08      | white tech, like, I don't know if Americans have this, I don't know what the equivalent is.             |
| 58:13      | It's kind of like a chewing gum like texture, but it doesn't stick permanently. That stuff              |
| 58:16      | from putting up like posters and so on. I can use that to like stick the NRC tags to a lot of           |
| 58:20      | things, which is great. And then yeah, I just don't have the issue with it breaking anymore.            |
| 58:26      | Oh, that's awesome. Can we put in the show notes what you use just because I'm, I think I might         |
| 58:34      | do this, because it also looks like it won't yellow as quickly as a sticker does. That's also           |
| 58:42      | why I have to replace them. Yeah, yeah, this is the advantage of like the hard plastic chips,           |
| 58:47      | and they come in like white and black and so on as well. And you can always stick like a sticker        |
| 58:51      | on them to like tell you what they mean or whatever. But at the same time, you can also just            |
| 58:56      | use them as like a plain white chip, which you know, has the partner approval factor of these           |
| 59:02      | don't look garish and disgusting or weird, like what is going on here? Exactly. Oh, and I should        |
| 59:11      | also mention that all of these, of course, trigger time tracking shortcuts that are via Timery,         |
| 59:23      | the amazing app that I think everyone uses. But if you aren't using Timery, you should. It's            |
| 59:30      | probably, it is probably my most important like quote productivity app other than OmniFocus. And        |
| 59:41      | that's just just a huge thing. I always have a timer running just to make sure that I'm on              |
| 59:50      | track. Because if at the end of the week, I look at my report, and I haven't done what I set out to     |
| 59:59      | do, it makes me sad. And sometimes what I set out to do is literally just play video games.             |
| 01:00:06   | Next to my switch, there's also a little NFC tag. But on the back of my Nintendo switch,                |
| 01:00:18   | and that just turns all the lights down and starts my video game timer. I have a timer                  |
| 01:00:27   | or project in Timery that's just called Life. And that is what I use whenever I am just tracking        |
| 01:00:40   | existence that isn't work involved. And I want to see that bar of the graph get bigger every            |
| 01:00:50   | week. That's the goal anyway. Isn't it shocking to you, though, to see that data? Because you           |
| 01:00:55   | have this perception of how you're spending your time, and then you look at it and you're like,         |
| 01:01:02   | and the actual numbers are so far different than what you think you're spending your time on.           |
| 01:01:06   | I'm always shocked by that. Yeah, I've been time tracking since I, gosh, it was hard in high            |
| 01:01:17   | school because we weren't allowed to have phones on us or anything. But it really also just makes       |
| 01:01:26   | it easier to find out where your time is being spent in ways that are... I'm not even talking           |
| 01:01:35   | like, oh, I was too quote unquote lazy. No, I'm like, oh, I spent a long time on this project           |
| 01:01:43   | and I don't really enjoy it. And there's not really any benefits from it. So let's make that            |
| 01:01:50   | report a lot smaller. I only want to see a little bit of email and administrative time,                 |
| 01:01:56   | not that being a giant thing. This isn't do by Friday, this is automated, sorry.                        |
| 01:02:04   | But at the same time, time tracking is a really valuable tool and being able to automate that           |
| 01:02:10   | is something that's really, really useful. So I've been automating a bunch of my time tracking.         |
| 01:02:14   | You know, if I'm taking a ballet class or an acrobatics class, guess what? I run my Apple Watch         |
| 01:02:20   | workout tracking and that starts a timer timer. And then when it stops, it stops the timer timer.       |
| 01:02:26   | Really simple. I get into my car and start driving. It starts a driving timer. I get out of my car      |
| 01:02:31   | and therefore I've stopped driving. It stops my driving timer and it allows me to just know where       |
| 01:02:35   | my life is going automatically, giving me a much better sense over the week of, okay, well, we're       |
| 01:02:41   | just spent this much time sleeping, this much time driving, and this much time doing these various      |
| 01:02:48   | things like podcasting, automated time tracking and things like that because I use a bunch to start     |
| 01:02:52   | my podcasting mode. And one of the things it does is run a shortcut that starts my podcasting timer.    |
| 01:02:59   | And so I can then look back on my week. Even if I've forgotten to do manual time tracking,              |
| 01:03:04   | which, you know, I'm working on doing some stuff with the Stream Deck and so on, with Keyboard          |
| 01:03:09   | Maestro, I'm stealing from TJ Luoma as Fantastic L, Fantastic Pal, as script as an idea of like,         |
| 01:03:16   | you know, I'll just have different colours on a Stream Deck button and have [[Keyboard Maestro]]             |
| 01:03:20   | change it based on, you know, stuff that you can check or stuff that gets triggered, which happens      |
| 01:03:26   | to be done thanks to, you know, timer and shortcuts. Then yeah, like, you know, I even if I forget to   |
| 01:03:33   | do the manual stuff, it's amazing how much stuff does get logged. And things like turning down          |
| 01:03:38   | your lights when you start, you know, playing a game and so on. I've been fortunate enough to be        |
| 01:03:42   | able to completely automate that. So if I start playing a film, like my living room just dims           |
| 01:03:47   | all of its lights and everything for me, which is just great because then, you know, I sit down to      |
| 01:03:51   | watch film, all the lights dim, I hit pause, the lights come back up. So if I need to go to the         |
| 01:03:55   | bathroom, like I hit pause, I can immediately see where I'm going, I come back, I hit play,             |
| 01:03:59   | and it just dims back down into like a cinema mode, stuff like that. It's all automation,               |
| 01:04:04   | and it's just so much fun. Alex, you mentioned Apple's Vision OS and Vision Pro Glasses earlier         |
| 01:04:13   | in the context of context, like how I did that. So I too am thinking like you, every time I talk        |
| 01:04:23   | to Alex, I wish you lived closer because you and I, our nerd alignment is so close. I just feel         |
| 01:04:29   | like we would have so much fun if you lived closer. But the, but either way, what are you               |
| 01:04:33   | thinking about with the Vision OS? It's almost like I've been listening to you for a decade and         |
| 01:04:37   | it's sort of influenced the way I think. Yeah, but you always influence me every time we talk.          |
| 01:04:42   | You have such good ideas. I went, when Vision OS was announced, I mean, I think I'm more excited        |
| 01:04:51   | for a new operating system than I am the actual headset. If anyone, everyone should subscribe           |
| 01:05:01   | to my podcast and pay me so I can get a Vision Pro. No, but as I talk about, you know, all of these     |
| 01:05:12   | contexts throughout my apartment, again, they are contexts more importantly for my brain. And I         |
| 01:05:22   | am so excited that it's going to become a, the like images and, or not images, but like my              |
| 01:05:31   | sightlines are going to literally be able to, you know, be contextually triggered by like a tap of my   |
| 01:05:42   | thumb to my forefinger or whatever. That is the dream, putting on a headset and then having             |
| 01:05:52   | all of this in front of me, like having just, oh God, I bet you guys too are just imagining             |
| 01:06:03   | putting like pulling shortcut blocks in the air. That's just, that's so exciting to me.                 |
| 01:06:11   | Because I know folks are very worried about it taking you out of the real world. And sure,              |
| 01:06:20   | it's very early days, but it's also, I think, about getting the unimportant stuff out of the            |
| 01:06:31   | way. It's going to make it even easier switching contexts with Vision OS. We saw at WWDC this           |
| 01:06:42   | year. I think we saw more entertainment things than productivity and work stuff because that's,         |
| 01:06:49   | you know, what gets normal people for lack of a better term, excited. And I mean, with Vision           |
| 01:07:00   | OS already, it's going to, you know, have shortcuts. That's correct, right? They did                    |
| 01:07:08   | announce that it's going to, you'll be able to trigger shortcuts on it because they,                    |
| 01:07:12   | I don't remember 100% of being announced, but I do know that, you know, iPad apps can run on Vision     |
| 01:07:18   | OS. Kind of like you can run an iPad app on a Mac, you know, like the developer has to,                 |
| 01:07:23   | you know, make sure it's compiled for it and check a checkbox. You know, it's not going to be           |
| 01:07:28   | perfect if they just go, yeah, sure, I'll just check the box. Let's go for this. But it should          |
| 01:07:34   | work. So my understanding is, yeah, shortcuts is there on or will be there on Vision OS.                |
| 01:07:40   | And yeah, if [[Final Cut Pro]] is going to run on visionOS, I feel like most things should be              |
| 01:07:53   | able to as a digital button should be easy to press. But I like with the way that, you know,            |
| 01:08:07   | the iPad has [[Stage Manager]] and iOS has different focus modes. I want that in front of my face.          |
| 01:08:17   | Like I want reminders of what I should or could be doing without having to, you know, do something      |
| 01:08:29   | that, I don't know, it's difficult to explain because so much of it is really,                          |
| 01:08:34   | it's so different for everyone, their needs, but also their abilities. My biggest, I think,             |
| 01:08:46   | gripe with all of Apple's OS is how much the accessibility settings are buried within settings          |
| 01:08:57   | because, you know, all of us nerds can go off about the UI of every sort of system preferences          |
| 01:09:07   | UI. It's just a mess everywhere. I know it's difficult. But accessibility,                              |
| 01:09:17   | it's definitely changing. But for the longest time, it's not that it was stigmatised,                   |
| 01:09:24   | but it really wasn't talked about at WWDC. And people, I don't think, were just using it to its         |
| 01:09:34   | full potential. But now that, you know, it's so baked in with shortcuts and stuff like that,            |
| 01:09:44   | I know that for me, at least, having things on Vision OS and like, you know,                            |
| 01:09:52   | using voice control and something with Vision OS and having my hands be free to do whatever             |
| 01:10:00   | is going to be huge because it's just that little, I just get a little bit of RAM back.                 |
| 01:10:09   | Like, if I have something in literally in the corner of my vision, it can be helpful. There's           |
| 01:10:16   | this app called One Thing and it literally just sits in your menu bar and does one thing. And           |
| 01:10:24   | that's always what I am working on. Is that one thing? And it's in my menu bar and I can always         |
| 01:10:32   | see it. I think with Vision OS, sure, you, it's always in your vision and it's like,                    |
| 01:10:39   | ah, your work can be everywhere with you. And it's like, no, no, no, I want it to be like,              |
| 01:10:44   | yes, this is always here with me and I can, you know, being able to physically automate something.      |
| 01:10:55   | There's something about it that gets me excited about the future of automation and the future of        |
| 01:11:02   | accessibility because, you know, a lot of my shortcuts do end up, they end up having accessibility      |
| 01:11:13   | actions, whether it's, you know, my nighttime one changes the text to be bigger on my iPad,             |
| 01:11:19   | so I can read it. I mentioned before the show how I like to change my AirPods settings when I am        |
| 01:11:29   | out and about because it makes me, it makes it easier to hear folks. I use my iPhone sometimes          |
| 01:11:38   | to magnify things that if I can't, you know, read something, like you don't have to be,                 |
| 01:11:44   | you know, quote unquote, like disabled to use accessibility is for everyone. And hopefully,             |
| 01:11:53   | people have heard this a million times, but I kind of, I'm really excited to see what Vision OS         |
| 01:12:00   | does with accessibility and not even just like site-wise, but whatever, like just different             |
| 01:12:09   | ways to use your hands. I was very much like, there's not going to be a controller for the              |
| 01:12:17   | Vision Pro, like there's no way, no, Apple has been literal hands-on since the iPhone, like,            |
| 01:12:24   | no, future is, you know, air pokies. And I think being able to blink and move all of my windows,        |
| 01:12:36   | like, that's what I'm thinking about, I guess, like blinking and completely changing context,           |
| 01:12:44   | not blinking, but, you know, like blinking, blink three times, and then suddenly you're                 |
| 01:12:49   | in entertainment mode and all of your, all of your lights have changed. That's almost like              |
| 01:12:55   | teleporting. Yeah, and it's still hard for me to, I mean, I'm mumbly and stumbly and all the time,      |
| 01:13:11   | but even more so when I'm thinking and talking about Vision OS, since it's so new,                      |
| 01:13:16   | there's so much imagination to be had. I feel like there's so much more to the interface                |
| 01:13:23   | that we haven't seen that, like, when the iPhone was new, people were new to a touch screen,            |
| 01:13:29   | and Apple went really slowly for the first several years, getting you to do more gestures and more      |
| 01:13:34   | complex things. And I feel like there is a whole library of gestures inside Apple that they're          |
| 01:13:39   | not going to expose to, like, version three of this product. And some of those will be in accessibility |
| 01:13:44   | and some of them just won't be visible yet or available, but they'll come at some point.                |
| 01:13:50   | The other thing that you touch on, Alex, that's interesting to me is the idea of context and            |
| 01:13:54   | Vision OS, because you and I are tracking, because I'm like, I love the idea of being able, like,       |
| 01:13:59   | for me, it's like even more deep, like, what if I could say I do my writing at a cabin,                 |
| 01:14:07   | you know, at Machu Picchu, you know, and the device gets good enough that I feel like that              |
| 01:14:13   | that's there. And then before, you know, my brain, as soon as I load that up, my brain's like, oh,      |
| 01:14:17   | writing mode, get to work writing and don't think about, you know, Ahsoka series or whatever.           |
| 01:14:22   | And so I feel like there's something to that. But the interesting piece of it to me is Apple            |
| 01:14:27   | was so focused on making this an augmented reality product. They really, you know, the                  |
| 01:14:33   | high is that the windows show up in your living room and that's such a focus of them. But I feel        |
| 01:14:37   | like for context stuff, sometimes virtual reality could be better if it's done with these high-quality  |
| 01:14:44   | screens. And Apple's not talking about that, because I feel like they don't really want to              |
| 01:14:47   | talk about virtual reality. I feel like they did talk about it. And for anybody who hasn't listened     |
| 01:14:52   | to that [[Cortex]] episode, all about Vision OS and the new Vision Pro that's going to come out,            |
| 01:15:00   | because Mike got to actually try one at WWDC. If you haven't listened to that, folks,                   |
| 01:15:05   | please do go listen to that, because [[Cortex]] is amazing. And B, because Mike does a really great         |
| 01:15:09   | job of walking you through exactly what his experience was like. But the digital crown                  |
| 01:15:14   | on the side of the Vision Pro, that you can turn it and you can adjust how much reality                 |
| 01:15:22   | is in your vision. So if somebody walks in, they're still going to appear and come, like,               |
| 01:15:28   | come in and there could be a ghost. But you can say, okay, I want Machu Picchu. I want to be            |
| 01:15:36   | sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon. I want to be floating above a Formula One race, whatever       |
| 01:15:42   | it is. But you could also just be like, no, I'm just in my office at home. But because you can          |
| 01:15:50   | also, from my understanding, make your own 3D pictures and so on, I wonder if at some point             |
| 01:15:55   | we're going to get the ability to scan our environments. Because I know for me that could               |
| 01:15:59   | be really useful, because every so often, I'll have to do work, but there'll be something in            |
| 01:16:04   | my office bugging me. Like, I was in the middle of doing the same with my 3D printer last night,        |
| 01:16:09   | but I got frustrated and I stopped. And now out of the corner of my eye, I can see my 3D printer.       |
| 01:16:14   | And it's like taunting me of like, you haven't finished replacing this bit or whatever it is.           |
| 01:16:19   | Like, that's not actually the case right now. But I can imagine if I had taken a 3D scan of             |
| 01:16:25   | my office to use this like my working environment, like I could just be like, no, I'm in an idealised   |
| 01:16:31   | version of my office right now. I don't know that there's a massive box on the floor that could         |
| 01:16:35   | trip me up if I walk in that direction. I mean, obviously, like before I got up to walk around,         |
| 01:16:40   | I would have to reenter reality mode. But I feel like this could be really, really useful because       |
| 01:16:47   | it allows you to both set your context, but also just like fix your context. And I know that            |
| 01:16:54   | for a lot of people, you know, having context, sound and visual is a huge part of that and              |
| 01:17:02   | being able to get in and out of the zone. Like, I have days where I should just be able to get          |
| 01:17:06   | into the zone and snap and I'll do the exact same thing the next day that worked the previous day.      |
| 01:17:12   | And for some reason, there'll be something somewhere that I can see or hear that is bugging me and I    |
| 01:17:17   | won't be able to get in the zone. I feel like between the audio and the video in the Vision Pro,        |
| 01:17:22   | like I will be able to automate getting into the zone much more easily.                                 |
| 01:17:26   | Well, even like Alex in your small apartment, you were talking about you have a small apartment         |
| 01:17:31   | earlier. What if you could just put the headset on and feel like you're in a mountain glen or           |
| 01:17:36   | whatever? We had a meet up in the MacSparky Labs after the announcement and one of the guys in          |
| 01:17:41   | the labs spent a bunch of time in Tokyo like 10 years ago. He said, I lived in the box. He said,        |
| 01:17:46   | I lived in this tiny, tiny apartment in Tokyo. You know, they're famous for these little apartments.    |
| 01:17:51   | He said, I would have killed for this back then just because I always felt like I was like in this      |
| 01:17:56   | box. If I could put that on and feel like I was in someplace more spacious, it would have felt          |
| 01:18:01   | really good once in a while. And I feel like Apple hasn't told that story enough. I get what you        |
| 01:18:07   | mean. And Mike did a great job. I actually was in the room when Mike came back from that demo           |
| 01:18:12   | and he was all glazy-eyed. I think the way he said it to me is if they would have taken my credit       |
| 01:18:18   | card, I would have bought it right there. And I feel like there's just a lot to this thing for          |
| 01:18:23   | automators and people looking for contextual computing type applications that Apple hasn't              |
| 01:18:30   | really told that story yet, but I think it's there. I think we can say that we know it's there          |
| 01:18:40   | because so many people from the VR press, like I'm a little bit in the VR world and                     |
| 01:18:49   | so many people who like the VR press being there made me be like, okay, yeah, this is good to go.       |
| 01:18:57   | But there's just the way Apple tells stories, obviously, is always really specific. And right           |
| 01:19:05   | now, there are two terms that I think make people think certain things, which is artificial             |
| 01:19:14   | intelligence and virtual reality. And Apple really did kind of talk all about artificial                |
| 01:19:22   | intelligence and virtual reality in the WWDC keynote. They just didn't use those specifically           |
| 01:19:30   | because they want the Apple words and not the pre-written narrative that society has made.              |
| 01:19:40   | And I like that. Apple's afraid of the word [[artificial intelligence]]. They don't want it to,             |
| 01:19:45   | they don't want to get on that train, but they're doing it. Yeah. I had a bet that they would not,      |
| 01:19:53   | I was my developer friend, I'm like, I bet you a dollar and 50 cents. I don't know why I was 50         |
| 01:20:01   | cents, but Tim Cook, no one on that stage is going to say virtual reality or artificial                 |
| 01:20:12   | intelligence. They'll say machine learning. They will say, they're going to say spatial computing.      |
| 01:20:19   | And I was so happy. That was part of the bet. I'm like, yes, they did it. They used spatial             |
| 01:20:25   | computing instead of AR, or they did say AR. But Rose, like you said, I kind of want OmniFocus         |
| 01:20:35   | perspectives, like perspectives, so that I can just turn my head and then let's say you don't           |
| 01:20:46   | want to see that 3D printer. But in my VR headset, sometimes I watch Netflix. I also have an NFC tag    |
| 01:20:57   | on my, on my Quest. I will sometimes just watch Netflix in the Oculus Quest because it, or sorry,       |
| 01:21:08   | oh, Meta Quest, because that context switch is just better for my brain, even though the quality,        |
| 01:21:21   | like, you know, it's not 4K, it looks kind of crappy. But now with the Vision Pro, like, oh,            |
| 01:21:29   | like, oh, oh my gosh. And, you know, to snap back into reality when someone walks into the room is,     |
| 01:21:37   | I mean, this might be too far. But what if you could set automations to be triggered for specific       |
| 01:21:43   | people? That was, like, it wants that person, you know, like, if someone is wearing another Vision      |
| 01:21:54   | Pro, or they have, I mean, we know this thing can talk to iPhones and stuff already. Like, we,          |
| 01:22:01   | all of these chips can talk to one another, like the air tags, all of this stuff, all of the world      |
| 01:22:09   | of spatial computing is so ripe for automation that I want the David Sparks, Rosemary Orchard's,        |
| 01:22:19   | the Timery Joes of the world. David Smith, I am so, so excited for not just Apple's story,              |
| 01:22:27   | but of the developers, I know and trust their story of what spatial computing can be and our own.       |
| 01:22:36   | Like, there's still those, sorry, by our own, I mean, people, people like me who aren't necessarily     |
| 01:22:44   | developers, but build and use shortcuts, how there was those rumors that, like, oh, there's going to    |
| 01:22:50   | be a way to, like, build apps with Siri. And what I think the rumor, probably what that might be,       |
| 01:22:59   | is that we can build more apps with shortcuts and just say them into the air, like, build a             |
| 01:23:08   | shortcut just with, you know, just with voice control, which gets better. Oh, God, like, I mean,        |
| 01:23:16   | voice, I've been using voice control since my first Mac, just because it feels future-y and cool.       |
| 01:23:24   | But, you know, just doing that with your voice and being able to sort of build your own story of        |
| 01:23:31   | what you want in spatial computing excites me a lot, because just like with humans in software,         |
| 01:23:39   | diversity and system settings is better, I think.                                                       |
| 01:23:42   | All right, so let's go there for a minute. Let's get a little hypothetical. And so we're going to       |
| 01:23:46   | have to make some assumptions, because none of us have this yet. But what is your automation story?     |
| 01:23:52   | Let's say, Rose, you've got one of the things trapped on your head. How do you want to automate         |
| 01:23:56   | it to help you? What do you want to do with it? I think it really depends on the context. Like,         |
| 01:24:01   | for example, if I'm packing for a trip, like, I want, like, the current, like, a subset of things       |
| 01:24:07   | that I'm packing to be, like, a kind of little post-it note that's, like, sitting in, like, the         |
| 01:24:12   | corner of my field of view. Not obscuring stuff, but, like, it's there. And then when I look at it,     |
| 01:24:16   | it, like, zooms in and pops up and is, like, okay, you need, like, these three things left.             |
| 01:24:21   | Because number of times that I get distracted while walking around the house, looking for               |
| 01:24:25   | something while I'm packing is way too big. And, you know, it would be a similar thing going            |
| 01:24:31   | shopping. I'm not sure I would wear it to go to, like, the grocery store, but at the same time,         |
| 01:24:36   | you never know. It could be really useful if when you're looking at, like, the shelf in the             |
| 01:24:40   | grocery store, it could be, like, highlighting the things that you need. And then you look at it and    |
| 01:24:45   | it's like, by the way, here's the macro information on this. Like, this is really full of sugar,        |
| 01:24:50   | but this one right next to it, that you know, tastes pretty much the same, way better for you.          |
| 01:24:55   | Okay, I'll buy the one that's better for me. You know, that would be really nice.                       |
| 01:24:58   | So, so you want an AI bot that, like, is, like, your mother that's just gonna say,                      |
| 01:25:02   | I don't want to be like my mother, but I want, like, a personal assistant out of it, basically.         |
| 01:25:07   | Like, the thing that's reminding me, like, hey, you got distracted from this, but this is what          |
| 01:25:12   | you're supposed to be doing. Or, like, you know, just the thing that can understand that, you know,     |
| 01:25:18   | I, I'm currently, you know, I'm watching the show, but I'm like half watching the show because,         |
| 01:25:23   | like, I'm actually thinking about this problem. So it won't, like, let the show get too big and         |
| 01:25:28   | take over the screen. It will, like, you know, keep it a smaller corner. And, you know, at the end      |
| 01:25:36   | of the show, like, the episode, it won't alter play the next episode, or something, because,            |
| 01:25:41   | you know, I was kind of all lunch break and, you know, just thinking about, you know, what should       |
| 01:25:45   | I be doing next, and how do I solve this problem, etc. So, yeah, like, I feel like that's where I       |
| 01:25:51   | want to start. And then from there, you know, things like [[Swift Playgrounds]].                            |
| 01:25:55   | Wait, wait, that's where you want to start? You want to, you want a robot built?                        |
| 01:25:59   | Oh, no, no, no, this is, yeah, no, Rose, I am totally there.                                            |
| 01:26:03   | Like, obviously, it's gonna take a while and, and things like that. But, like, I feel like              |
| 01:26:08   | having, like, an OmniFocus perspective in the quarter of my field of view. And, like,                   |
| 01:26:13   | Ken's already, like, building that stuff. Exactly. Like, it's a group of already                        |
| 01:26:17   | got their apps. Like, they've got their apps run on visionOS or, like, they set them up and tested      |
| 01:26:21   | them. Like, I don't know if they've got their hands on a piece of hardware and actually been to         |
| 01:26:25   | a lab and tried stuff out. I would be surprised if they hadn't had that opportunity. But, you know,     |
| 01:26:31   | I feel like that, you know, Omni Group and so on. And similarly, [[Drafts]], I'm gonna need that,           |
| 01:26:37   | I'm gonna need [[Drafts]]. Like, obviously, I'm gonna need [[Drafts]]. But I feel like widgets on top of        |
| 01:26:43   | my life would be a really good place to start. Like, widgets and interactivity. And guess what?         |
| 01:26:48   | Widgets are becoming interactive with iOS 17. So, that's the thing.                                     |
| 01:26:52   | Yeah, it seems like it is coming together, doesn't it? Yeah. Day one beta this year because of the      |
| 01:26:57   | interactive widgets. Oh, yeah. I've just been living the best life.                                     |
| 01:27:03   | Losing my mind with, yes, it's amazing. It is so good. But then on top of that, you know, like,         |
| 01:27:11   | when we get to something like [[Swift Playgrounds]], [[Swift Playgrounds]] is already on the iPad, right?       |
| 01:27:15   | And Shortcuts is on the iPad. So, both of these apps should theoretically exist on visionOS.            |
| 01:27:20   | Because any iPad app can exist on visionOS. Now, Mac apps don't exist on visionOS. There's              |
| 01:27:26   | something like [[Xcode]] we wouldn't have, but you can share, like, you know, a Mac screen                  |
| 01:27:30   | into visionOS. So, you could still have something like [[Xcode]]. But imagine being able to, like,          |
| 01:27:34   | write your own mini apps in [[Swift Playgrounds]] and with Shortcuts on visionOS and just run them.         |
| 01:27:44   | Like, and then you get really creative. Because I feel like, I know that [[Swift Playgrounds]] has          |
| 01:27:50   | got limitations. I know a lot of people have done some really cool stuff with it. I've written          |
| 01:27:54   | stuff with it and then, you know, turned it into an app on the App Store. But I feel like               |
| 01:27:59   | bringing that into Shortcuts, like, visionOS is kind of the place to do it because it's                 |
| 01:28:05   | this whole cool new thing. And at the moment, I can write a script and run a script                     |
| 01:28:10   | on another machine from Shortcuts. I say another machine, like, macOS Shortcuts has support for         |
| 01:28:18   | command line scripts, AppleScripts, et cetera. But iOS just doesn't have that. The closest it's        |
| 01:28:23   | got is being able to run JavaScript on a page, on, like, a web page, which is a bookmarklet,            |
| 01:28:29   | essentially. But it would be really cool if you could integrate [[Swift Playgrounds]] stuff                 |
| 01:28:34   | with Shortcuts and then you could just automate all the things. Because [[Swift]] is a really powerful      |
| 01:28:38   | language. So I feel like you can pretty much do anything when you got those two. So maybe               |
| 01:28:44   | visionOS will be the thing that brings them together. I think that really quickly,                      |
| 01:28:50   | instead of iOS, visionOS is going to be my main operating system because of what you've just            |
| 01:28:58   | said. I mean, on top of that, I think that this hardware that is so different, there are going          |
| 01:29:11   | to be people who just have a different set of skills and a different way of thinking that               |
| 01:29:17   | will be building things that we've literally never seen and that other software developers may          |
| 01:29:24   | literally never thought of before, just because all of our brains are different. And I really hope      |
| 01:29:32   | that the Apple gets a, I mean, I know the SDK is there, but I really hope that cheaper hardware         |
| 01:29:42   | comes out soon, just so the accessibility of building things is easier. Because I know that             |
| 01:29:50   | I've played a little bit with the SDK, but it's just not the same. And from using a VR headset,         |
| 01:30:05   | and I've tried to use the SDK as kind of like, all right, just pretend you're in this environment.      |
| 01:30:17   | And it helps a little bit if you use a PlayStation controller, but I mean, you can't really, I think,   |
| 01:30:24   | unlock all of the possibilities unless you're using it. And only a few hundred people have              |
| 01:30:31   | ever tried this thing. I think it's going to be amazing. I'm with you guys. I feel like I don't         |
| 01:30:37   | know where it's going to lead. But for a starting point for me is getting to the contextual idea.       |
| 01:30:43   | I want to strap to my face and say, take me to the writing cabin. And I just want everything to         |
| 01:30:48   | happen. I want the focus modes, the, what I see through the headset, the apps that open. I want         |
| 01:30:55   | it to be a thing where you just put it on and you jump from one thing to a next. And it gives you       |
| 01:31:00   | like a little respite from the rest of the world, which is terrible to say. I have a great, I live      |
| 01:31:06   | in a nice little house. I'm happy. People are generally clean. But still, I would like the              |
| 01:31:11   | ability to escape once in a while and feel like it's going to be possible. I don't think that's         |
| 01:31:17   | a bad for the paltry sum of $3,500 to begin with, but yeah. In my case, plus a flight and hotel         |
| 01:31:26   | stay in the U.S. And I have prescription lenses. Yeah. But I really think that Apple is looking         |
| 01:31:34   | at this as a minimum viable technology. Like it has to have resolution and it has to have screen        |
| 01:31:41   | refresh and it has to have all this stuff to a certain minimum level in order for it to work.           |
| 01:31:46   | And that will get cheaper. And I think they call it vision pro because eventually there's               |
| 01:31:52   | just going to be a vision and a vision pro just like the iPhone. And that one will be less expensive.   |
| 01:31:58   | I mean, it is efficient. The way, I think the way they marketed was really smart. But David,            |
| 01:32:06   | have you, I think you have, you've worked in the, gosh, I forget the app name, but working in the       |
| 01:32:17   | Meta Quest when I would work in space. Yeah. I wrote a blog post about that. I was circling              |
| 01:32:25   | there with writing a blog post. And it was great except for the resolution. It was too blocky.          |
| 01:32:31   | And so you can only do it for like an hour and then you started to feel kind of a little gross.         |
| 01:32:38   | And with the vision pro, it's way higher resolution, way higher screen refresh. So I                    |
| 01:32:43   | think you'll be comfortable putting on. I don't know that you're going to want to wear it for           |
| 01:32:46   | eight hours, but I think that like if you want to do an hour or two work session, I think it            |
| 01:32:51   | probably should be no problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember Mike describing the headaches that he       |
| 01:32:55   | got from the Meta Quest pro, because essentially, like he's looking at text, right? And it's just        |
| 01:33:03   | the quality is not high enough. And Gray didn't really have this issue because, you know, he was        |
| 01:33:09   | looking at like the text projected on a whiteboard, which was a distance away. So your eyes will,       |
| 01:33:17   | you know, allow something to be a bit blurry, that's a longer distance away and not give you            |
| 01:33:22   | like that, that massively draining headache that you can get. But then, yeah, the screens in the        |
| 01:33:27   | vision pro should make it way easier because, you know, you look at stuff and it's like reality.        |
| 01:33:36   | Which is, you know, I think this is why Apple is so focused on augmented reality, because               |
| 01:33:40   | like you can just overlay text on the top of a thing. So imagine a language learner                     |
| 01:33:45   | who's put on a vision pro and they open whatever their language learning app of choice is.              |
| 01:33:49   | And suddenly everything that they see, like if they look at that thing, it gets like the name           |
| 01:33:56   | of whatever it is in the language that they're learning in both like phonetic script and,               |
| 01:34:00   | you know, whatever the correct script is for the language that they're learning underneath it.          |
| 01:34:05   | That would be so cool. Like that would be really useful. Obviously, you wouldn't be allowed to          |
| 01:34:11   | even exam. But, you know, I could just imagine like that being really useful for a whole bunch of       |
| 01:34:15   | people because it's like, oh, this thing that I never know what the name of that is. Okay,              |
| 01:34:20   | I know what the name of that is now. Great. A glass of beer, for example, in French.                    |
| 01:34:25   | Then, yeah, like, you know, this will at some point hopefully end up thinning down to something         |
| 01:34:32   | that looks like a pair of glasses or sunglasses. And, you know, being affordable for everybody.         |
| 01:34:39   | And I think, you know, when that happens, it won't seem weird anymore. Like, I would not                |
| 01:34:45   | wear a vision pro to the supermarket to buy groceries just to be clear. Not yet.                        |
| 01:34:51   | Part of me would be like, I would love to if there was like an app that could like tell me the          |
| 01:34:54   | calorie information and help me like be like, oh, you're in the fruit section. Here's the fruit         |
| 01:34:59   | fruit and vegetable section from your grocery list. These are the things that you need. You're          |
| 01:35:02   | leaving the fruit and vegetable section, but you did not buy bananas. Go back and pick up bananas.      |
| 01:35:07   | But, you know, when I was at WWC, I talked to a guy who went over to cafe Max for lunch and said,       |
| 01:35:12   | two people walked in wearing the headset, got their lunch and left without ever taking them off.        |
| 01:35:17   | I mean, it will be. I mean, I feel like on Apple campus, that's a bit more normal than,                 |
| 01:35:21   | you know, the grocery store in my town of 40,000 people here in the UK. I mean,                         |
| 01:35:27   | everyone in my office mocked me for having my AirPods in all the time. And then it was like             |
| 01:35:34   | barely six months later, everyone had them in. And I mean, I like on the Vision Pro that it             |
| 01:35:45   | you can see when someone is looking at you and you know that I wish almost there was                    |
| 01:35:53   | a signal on the AirPods somehow like a little light for folks to know like, no, I am I'm listening      |
| 01:36:00   | to you. But the clarity from the AirPods and the automation I have to make it just the world            |
| 01:36:08   | more listenable. Like I just wish that was a thing. Again, another like context switch.                 |
| 01:36:18   | Well, you know what we need to do? Once this thing gets released and we all get our hands on            |
| 01:36:23   | them and we start automating, we got to have you back, Alex. And you got to tell us what you're         |
| 01:36:28   | automating. This is all I think about, honestly. Like I have a new show just based around like,         |
| 01:36:34   | well, augmented reality and stuff in general. But I just think this is going to make,                   |
| 01:36:43   | I don't want to say make people better that makes it sound like people are bad. But I just think        |
| 01:36:48   | this is another layer of computing that is going to unlock a lot of creativity and even a lot of        |
| 01:37:01   | empathy and just different parts of our brains. The bicycle for the mind thing. Yeah. This is           |
| 01:37:09   | like a little electric scooter for your mind. I'm stoked. My abacus needs as much help as it can get.   |
| 01:37:16   | Yeah. And especially with the eyes on the front, you know, Alex, you're saying about the,               |
| 01:37:21   | you know, the idea of the indicator light for the AirPods. I feel like the eyes on the front            |
| 01:37:27   | will really help people understand with that. Like, no, I am looking at you. I'm just not               |
| 01:37:32   | taking this off because taking this off is, you know, like a thing. And then I have to put it           |
| 01:37:36   | back on and so on. And like, I am seeing like the window with the application that's got the            |
| 01:37:42   | information in that you're asking me about right here. So yeah, I feel like you're going to get         |
| 01:37:48   | there. Or you're seeing like their name and pronouns or something. And it's like, no, seeing            |
| 01:37:54   | this is like a curtain, like, no, no, I want to communicate with you, not I am ignoring you.            |
| 01:38:04   | And you both mentioned, obviously, when the hardware gets smaller and easier, we'll get                 |
| 01:38:09   | to that point. But I do think this is going to connect people more than isolate them. It's a            |
| 01:38:15   | really strong belief I've had for a while and Apple by presenting it in this way and only               |
| 01:38:26   | releasing it when the tech was ready, that it wouldn't turn people off like when you're wearing         |
| 01:38:34   | a VR headset, it makes you sick or whatever. I think no, not I think I know that this is going          |
| 01:38:43   | to revolutionise computing, even if vision OS is a total failure, because more and more people          |
| 01:38:51   | are going to think about spatial computing and ambient computing, even if it's not on your face,        |
| 01:38:58   | you're going to think about just what is around you and be more mindful in general                      |
| 01:39:06   | of how you're using something that's it's hard not to be.                                               |
| 01:39:13   | Yeah, and I don't even want to open the can of worms about the 3D video, but it's the                   |
| 01:39:18   | holiday. I mean, you really are. And we went this thing really goes mainstream, you'll be able to       |
| 01:39:24   | look at your loved one on the other side of the world, and it'll feel like they're in the               |
| 01:39:28   | room with you. And that's that's amazing. Either way, Alex, where do people go to find out more         |
| 01:39:35   | of the stuff you're making? You can go to Alexcox.me or I would ask this is coming out in two weeks,    |
| 01:39:45   | right? Yeah. Did you say overtake? Go to haptic.show if you like talking about theoretical              |
| 01:39:55   | computing and AR and VR and all of that stuff. I think you might enjoy it.                              |
| 01:40:05   | I'm signing up. I'm signing up. I can't wait. All right, we are the Automators podcast. You can         |

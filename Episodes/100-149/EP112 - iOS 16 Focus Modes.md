| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard.                 |
| 00:07      | Hi, Rosemary.                                                                                           |
| 00:08      | Hey, how are you, David?                                                                                |
| 00:09      | I am great.                                                                                             |
| 00:10      | And this is The Automators, where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your              |
| 00:14      | work for you.                                                                                           |
| 00:16      | And this isn't an episode I have been looking forward to.                                               |
| 00:19      | We're going to be talking today about the new iOS 16 focus modes, how they work, what                   |
| 00:24      | we're doing, and how you can use them to your advantage.                                                |
| 00:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 00:29      | Yeah, we are.                                                                                           |
| 00:30      | But I thought, before we dive into that, I mean, it's focus mode adjacent, but I decided                |
| 00:36      | that I was going to go strap an iPad Pro to my wrist, or, well, it's an Apple Watch Ultra,              |
| 00:43      | but for me, it certainly feels like it's an iPad Pro, but I'm really liking it.                         |
| 00:48      | Did you get one, David?                                                                                 |
| 00:49      | Yeah, I did.                                                                                            |
| 00:50      | And so now I have a Series 7 I need to sell, because I bought it thinking, well, I'll try               |
| 00:56      | it.                                                                                                     |
| 00:57      | It's really too big, and I immediately fell in love with this thing.                                    |
| 01:01      | My initial reaction when they leaked the kind of the industrial design of it, I thought                 |
| 01:05      | I didn't care for it.                                                                                   |
| 01:07      | But then when I put it on, I like this watch.                                                           |
| 01:11      | And I like that I go to bed, and it has like 75% of the battery left.                                   |
| 01:18      | And I kind of like the bigger screen, and it looks good on my wrist, but I'm bigger                     |
| 01:23      | than you are.                                                                                           |
| 01:24      | So I guess we should just start with that.                                                              |
| 01:29      | How does it fit on your wrist?                                                                          |
| 01:31      | You're a tiny person.                                                                                   |
| 01:32      | Yeah, so for context, and I'll try and put a link to the post for this in the show notes                |
| 01:38      | for folks.                                                                                              |
| 01:39      | My wrist is pretty much the size of the old 38-mil watch, which is slowly over the years                |
| 01:45      | grown to 42-mil, but they have managed to, more or less, without increasing the casing                  |
| 01:50      | size that much.                                                                                         |
| 01:52      | So the Apple Watch Ultra is a look on me.                                                               |
| 01:55      | It is a big chunky watch, but you know what, I actually really like it.                                 |
| 02:01      | It is pretty big, but it's not too big.                                                                 |
| 02:07      | It's not too crazy, and it certainly just, you know, it feels chunky, but I think the                   |
| 02:14      | trade-off in extra battery life is going to be great, speaking of which, I really need                  |
| 02:17      | to set it up so that when I go into my podcasting focus mode, it checks my Apple Watch battery          |
| 02:21      | level and then tells me to charge it if it needs to, because with this new battery, I                   |
| 02:25      | keep forgetting to charge the darn thing.                                                               |
| 02:27      | It's great.                                                                                             |
| 02:28      | I'm really liking it.                                                                                   |
| 02:29      | Yeah, when I go into my podcasting focus mode, the watch face turns green, and the faces                |
| 02:36      | turn to the times like I get the London time zone, but now I'm teasing what we're going                 |
| 02:40      | to be talking about later.                                                                              |
| 02:42      | Now if they made the same features and functionality, maybe a slightly less battery life and slightly   |
| 02:48      | smaller, would you get that one over the big one?                                                       |
| 02:50      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 02:51      | Absolutely.                                                                                             |
| 02:52      | 100%.                                                                                                   |
| 02:53      | If they had offered the smaller one, this would have been a no-brainer instead of me slowly             |
| 02:57      | trying to talk myself into it for a couple of weeks and then managing to get an appointment             |
| 03:02      | at the Apple Store to pick one up on launch day, which they still had them in stock when                |
| 03:07      | I left, which was good to know.                                                                         |
| 03:10      | But yeah, it's one of those things, especially coming from the smaller watch.                           |
| 03:14      | That means that none of my previous straps fit, which is just a little bit sad, but you                 |
| 03:19      | know what, I'm living with it.                                                                          |
| 03:21      | I'm still going to keep one of the smaller watches, and I'll figure out, because I've                   |
| 03:26      | got a Series 6 and a Series 7, I'll figure out which one I'm going to keep as my sleep                  |
| 03:31      | watch or similar for occasions where I want to dress up and use some fancier straps.                    |
| 03:37      | Well this is going to be my only watch, and it was really, I love it first sight.                       |
| 03:42      | It's lighter than it looks, it feels great on my arm, doesn't bother me at all.                         |
| 03:48      | But I like the band that came with it, it's already dirty.                                              |
| 03:51      | The orange one got dirty pretty fast, but overall I just think it's great and super                     |
| 03:57      | happy with it.                                                                                          |
| 03:58      | But I have a little bit of an automation crisis related to the Apple Watch Ultra, and that              |
| 04:04      | is there's an extra button Rose, and the button can be used to program a shortcut.                      |
| 04:10      | And it's like, what do you do?                                                                          |
| 04:13      | You have one button that can program.                                                                   |
| 04:15      | It's got one setting, you can't change that setting, like this is the worst part of it                  |
| 04:20      | for me.                                                                                                 |
| 04:21      | I was hoping that there was going to be a button in shortcuts where I was going to be                   |
| 04:24      | able to go, yep, set my action button to this, or I was going to be able to set it per watch            |
| 04:28      | face or per focus mode, something like that.                                                            |
| 04:31      | Focus mode is what I wanted, like if I am in podcasting mode and I push the button,                     |
| 04:35      | something happens.                                                                                      |
| 04:37      | Whereas if I am in work mode or personal mode, something different happens, and it doesn't              |
| 04:42      | have that built in, but we are clever automators, aren't we?                                            |
| 04:46      | We are clever automators, and not only are we clever automators, iOS 16.1 is helping                    |
| 04:52      | us out here.                                                                                            |
| 04:53      | So if you are not on the beta, then you won't have 16.1 yet, you're going to have to hold               |
| 04:57      | on a little bit, but don't worry, it'll be out soon along with iPad OS 16.1, which iPad                 |
| 05:02      | OS 16 doesn't exist.                                                                                    |
| 05:05      | So there's a bonus little action there that helps us, and that's get focus mode.                        |
| 05:11      | So that gets your current focus mode.                                                                   |
| 05:13      | There's also another one, which is very helpful for getting your current watch face.                    |
| 05:18      | And so between the fact that you can get your focus mode and you can get your watch face,               |
| 05:23      | then you will be able to get those pieces of information and then do something with those               |
| 05:29      | to figure out what you're doing.                                                                        |
| 05:31      | And so what I've started by doing is I started by thinking, okay, what are the easiest, most            |
| 05:36      | simple use cases that I will have for this?                                                             |
| 05:40      | And so I started with my fitness focus mode, which does not get a lot of usage, probably                |
| 05:47      | get a little bit more use.                                                                              |
| 05:48      | And I've just said, hey, if the current focus mode is fitness, then the action that I would             |
| 05:54      | like to do is actually start a dance workout with an open goal, and then I'm using the                  |
| 05:58      | stop shortcut action.                                                                                   |
| 05:59      | And the stop shortcut action here is key for meaning that I do not have thousands of                    |
| 06:03      | nested ifs, because otherwise you've got else, if this else, if that else, if that, and you             |
| 06:09      | slowly end up with like, you know, fingers with the screen left with content in it.                     |
| 06:14      | So what I'm doing is I'm just saying, hey, if it's this, do the thing and stop the shortcut             |
| 06:18      | and that's it, the end of story.                                                                        |
| 06:21      | So yeah, and then the final thing that it does, if none of the things apply, I get a                    |
| 06:25      | list of my Apple watch faces, I get a random item from that list, because you can get use               |
| 06:31      | the get from list action with a random parameter.                                                       |
| 06:34      | And it gives you the random item.                                                                       |
| 06:36      | And then you can set your active watch face to the outcome of the list.                                 |
| 06:41      | And so that means that if I don't have something set up for that, whatever, you know, this              |
| 06:48      | is like my default fall through action, then I get a random watch face and notification                 |
| 06:53      | that says hello world, because I wanted to test that it worked and I haven't removed                    |
| 06:56      | that yet.                                                                                               |
| 06:57      | Yeah, that, that's madness to me, like randomly changing watch faces.                                   |
| 07:02      | I can't do that.                                                                                        |
| 07:03      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 07:04      | No, this, this is literally in, in case of, you know, nothing else applying, but you                    |
| 07:08      | know, while I'm working, it does things while I'm, you know, podcasting, it does another                |
| 07:12      | thing and so on and so forth.                                                                           |
| 07:14      | So I've got it set up to be, you know, it's covered the vast majority of cases.                         |
| 07:20      | It's just if I press this and I'm not in any focus mode, I think what it should probably                |
| 07:24      | do is start timer for me, like start, or prompt me to start some kind of timer, because that            |
| 07:30      | is one of the frequent things I do on the Apple watch, but I've not gone around to that                 |
| 07:34      | yet.                                                                                                    |
| 07:35      | I'd like to go back to something.                                                                       |
| 07:37      | Just to make sure everybody caught that is there is a problem with shortcuts in the sense               |
| 07:42      | that, you know, it's a programming language, but it's, it's fairly limited.                             |
| 07:46      | And it is very easy to get caught in like this never ending nesting list of if statements.              |
| 07:53      | So like, one of the ways Rose could have done it is to say, if focus mode is work, then                 |
| 07:58      | do this else, if focus mode is, you know, driving, do this.                                             |
| 08:03      | And then like the, they just keep nesting deeper and deeper and it is madness to do                     |
| 08:09      | it that way.                                                                                            |
| 08:10      | So explain how you got around that just a little slower.                                                |
| 08:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 08:14      | So I'm using the if statement and I delete the otherwise part.                                          |
| 08:17      | That's the first thing I do with the, when I've added the if, and then I, I set the                     |
| 08:21      | if parameters to whatever it is I need.                                                                 |
| 08:23      | So in this case, and I'll put a link to a mini post that I'm putting together in the                    |
| 08:27      | show notes on this as well for folks.                                                                   |
| 08:30      | But you know, in this case, I'm checking that my current focus mode is the fitness one.                 |
| 08:36      | And then I'm saying inside of the if statement, I'm going to do my action and then stop and             |
| 08:43      | stop the shortcut.                                                                                      |
| 08:44      | So there's, there's two kinds of stops.                                                                 |
| 08:45      | There's stop and output or there's just stop.                                                           |
| 08:48      | You can use whichever you like.                                                                         |
| 08:49      | It doesn't matter here, but the key is putting that stop inside the if statement because                |
| 08:53      | that way I don't need the otherwise.                                                                    |
| 08:55      | And whatever comes afterwards, I know that the previous thing is over and done with.                    |
| 08:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 09:00      | So basically the shortcut just goes down the if list.                                                   |
| 09:03      | Like if you are in work mode, but you're not in work mode, it just jumps to the next                    |
| 09:08      | if occurrence.                                                                                          |
| 09:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 09:10      | It's not nesting them, but whenever it does hit the one that said, oh, she is in work mode,             |
| 09:15      | then do this shortcut and then stop the shortcut and then it doesn't look at the rest of the            |
| 09:20      | list to see if you're in driving mode or whatever.                                                      |
| 09:24      | And it's very ingenious throws.                                                                         |
| 09:26      | As always, you come up with great ideas to make this stuff easier for us.                               |
| 09:30      | I would like to see [[Apple]] come up with ways to do this better.                                          |
| 09:34      | So we don't have to make these, so, you know, these funny hacks, but it works.                          |
| 09:40      | And I strongly recommend everybody that's got one of these ultra watches, take a look                   |
| 09:44      | at Rosa's script, because I think this is the way you do it.                                            |
| 09:48      | You've made it contextual.                                                                              |
| 09:49      | Like I looked at different options.                                                                     |
| 09:51      | I was looking at like, well, do I put a contextual menu and then have it say, well, pick what           |
| 09:56      | you're going to do.                                                                                     |
| 09:57      | You know, what is, are you going to write?                                                              |
| 09:58      | Are you going to, you know, podcast or whatever?                                                        |
| 10:00      | But that's what focus modes are.                                                                        |
| 10:02      | We're about to spend the whole show talking about focus modes and I can apply a focus                   |
| 10:06      | mode of my watch very quickly, just swipe up and you tap it.                                            |
| 10:09      | So I don't need the button to do that.                                                                  |
| 10:12      | And, you know, you've come up with, I think, a pretty good solution where you can run a                 |
| 10:18      | specific shortcut based on where you are.                                                               |
| 10:20      | The other one I got thinking is if you're really into, if you're really into toggle timing              |
| 10:26      | or using Timery, I think this would, that button would also be a good solution to say,                  |
| 10:33      | just start a new timer, you know, because the Timery Watch app is actually very good.                   |
| 10:39      | And so you could just, you know, trigger that.                                                          |
| 10:42      | I mean, let's be honest, I'm not going to use it to, you know, trigger me climbing Mount                |
| 10:47      | Everest, but, you know, starting a timer, yeah, that's probably about my speed.                         |
| 10:53      | But so I was thinking about it for that purpose as well, which thing got me thinking, man,              |
| 10:57      | wouldn't it be nice if we could have, you know, a double tap or some, a long press                      |
| 11:02      | or, you know, do one more thing with that button?                                                       |
| 11:05      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 11:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 11:07      | Well, as a warning, if you haven't tried long pressing on this, it starts a siren.                      |
| 11:14      | That is the default setting.                                                                            |
| 11:16      | And that is a fun experience to discover in a crowded mall.                                             |
| 11:21      | I was not the person who discovered this, I would like to point out, I was the person                   |
| 11:25      | who was still setting up my Apple Watch, sitting there eating some sushi, and the person next           |
| 11:29      | to me was setting up their Apple Watch and they were playing with it and they pressed                   |
| 11:32      | and held the button.                                                                                    |
| 11:33      | And we all regretted that.                                                                              |
| 11:35      | We all regretted that decision.                                                                         |
| 11:38      | I tried it.                                                                                             |
| 11:39      | It didn't seem like it was that loud.                                                                   |
| 11:41      | Like I keep thinking because where I hike, we get mountain lions occasionally and like                  |
| 11:46      | I like a loud noise will scare them off.                                                                |
| 11:49      | So, you know, just put like one of those little pocket air horns in your pocket and that could          |
| 11:53      | save your life.                                                                                         |
| 11:54      | But this isn't enough.                                                                                  |
| 11:56      | This isn't going to chase away a mountain lion.                                                         |
| 11:58      | I can tell you in a large, hard floor, hard ceiling, open space with not enough people                  |
| 12:06      | in it, that was pretty darn loud.                                                                       |
| 12:09      | So, you know, it really echoed off the walls there.                                                     |
| 12:12      | It was impressive.                                                                                      |
| 12:13      | And, you know, one of those things, he figured out how to turn it off very quickly.                     |
| 12:17      | I'm sure it still felt like it took an absolute eternity to him.                                        |
| 12:21      | But yeah, good news is it works.                                                                        |
| 12:24      | Yeah, then it's just one of those things, but I don't know like who dives enough that                   |
| 12:33      | they want a button on the side of their watch that regardless of when or where they are,                |
| 12:38      | will start diving like a star diving mode.                                                              |
| 12:41      | That to me seems like overkill, like from what I know about diving, especially, you                     |
| 12:47      | know, like deep sea diving, like you have to be careful.                                                |
| 12:49      | You can't do it too much because it puts your body under a lot of pressure and stress.                  |
| 12:53      | I think this was here for recreational diving.                                                          |
| 12:57      | I mean, it only goes to basically a hundred feet and people, those are pretty safe dives.               |
| 13:03      | You can do those regularly.                                                                             |
| 13:06      | I do wonder, like I just want to see in a year how many divers are using the Apple Watch                |
| 13:11      | as opposed to a dedicated dive computer, but you know, I could see that a lot of recreational           |
| 13:16      | divers may do it.                                                                                       |
| 13:17      | I mean, it seems like the software is good.                                                             |
| 13:20      | The user interface, I mean, I've had limited experience with dive computers.                            |
| 13:23      | I do scuba dive, but only like with a professional and only when I'm in Hawaii.                         |
| 13:28      | It's like a rare occasion thing.                                                                        |
| 13:31      | And the guy I dive with has a very fancy dive computer, but you know, I'm just the tourist              |
| 13:40      | that he takes down 50 feet to look at the turtle, so it doesn't really, it's overkill.                  |
| 13:45      | And I could see people that do what I do, but recreationally might use it, but you know,                |
| 13:52      | tweak your zone.                                                                                        |
| 13:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 13:54      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 13:55      | It's one of those things where I look at this and think, you know, like, so for people                  |
| 14:00      | who don't have the Ultra and haven't seen it, there's a number of options.                              |
| 14:03      | There is workout, stopwatch, waypoint, backtrack, dive, torch, shortcut, and none.                      |
| 14:10      | So you can just have that button do absolutely nothing if you want.                                     |
| 14:14      | And you know, it's not a hugely limited list of options, but I do think that they've missed             |
| 14:19      | two really big tricks.                                                                                  |
| 14:21      | Give me a shortcut section that lets me configure this and tie it into those focus modes.               |
| 14:27      | Let me have like my default action button mode here in the watch app, and then let me                   |
| 14:33      | change it in a focus mode setting, because they've already brought the Apple Watch faces                |
| 14:38      | into focus modes.                                                                                       |
| 14:40      | And so this to me seems like an obvious natural extension, but I mean, you can't even configure         |
| 14:45      | the action button per watch face, which to me would be the other way that I would want                  |
| 14:52      | to configure it or think that I could configure it.                                                     |
| 14:55      | But that said, you know, I'm able to work around this pretty nicely with a shortcut.                    |
| 15:00      | It turns off if you turn off the show when run action for the setting your watch face                   |
| 15:07      | in the Apple Watch, in the shortcut that you're going to use with your Ultra button, it significantly   |
| 15:12      | speeds things up.                                                                                       |
| 15:13      | That caught me out for the first error or so when I was playing with it.                                |
| 15:16      | So I was like, shortcuts shouldn't be this slow on my Apple Watch, you know, like it's,                 |
| 15:21      | I'm aware it's no, it's not exactly, you know, my Mac Studio, but it's still a pretty                   |
| 15:27      | good device.                                                                                            |
| 15:29      | What's happening here?                                                                                  |
| 15:30      | Why is it so slow?                                                                                      |
| 15:31      | And then I realised I had a show when run up there and it was just, it was trying to                    |
| 15:35      | do a show when run, but it didn't have anything to show me.                                             |
| 15:38      | And so it, it didn't know what to do.                                                                   |
| 15:40      | So I turned that off and it's at everything up again, but yeah, it's, it's, it's nice                   |
| 15:45      | having this option.                                                                                     |
| 15:46      | I think I need to do more with like getting my calendar and tying things into what's                    |
| 15:51      | in my calendar and so on so that I know more context for all of this.                                   |
| 15:56      | Well, I do think that, you know, [[Apple|Apple's]] trying to keep it simple.                                      |
| 16:00      | And they're like, if you're a runner and you want to do your splits with the action                     |
| 16:04      | button, I can see the arguments being saying, no, if the, if the user picked this action,               |
| 16:10      | then we want it to run no matter what focus mode they're in, no matter what watch face                  |
| 16:13      | they've got on.                                                                                         |
| 16:14      | But in my opinion, the way you'd solve that problem is you'd put a setting in the watch                 |
| 16:20      | faces and focus modes and during the setup, when you do the initial choice, it just applies             |
| 16:26      | it universally and makes that your default, no matter what device into, but then gives                  |
| 16:31      | nerds like us the ability to go in and change it and say, well, you know, if I'm in a work              |
| 16:36      | mode, I want to run this other shortcut and hopefully, I mean, it's early days.                         |
| 16:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 16:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 16:43      | I mean, the only thing with setting it in the watch face and the focus mode is to me,                   |
| 16:47      | you know, which one of those takes precedence, right?                                                   |
| 16:50      | So if I set it on the watch face and I set it in the focus mode, which one is king or                   |
| 16:55      | clean?                                                                                                  |
| 16:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 16:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 16:58      | I guess that perhaps if you don't have a setting on the watch face, then you could override             |
| 17:03      | it in the focus mode.                                                                                   |
| 17:04      | But if you choose a watch face for your focus mode, but then still you can, you can change              |
| 17:11      | watch faces while you're in a focus mode.                                                               |
| 17:13      | I feel like maybe skip the watch face preference.                                                       |
| 17:15      | There we go, [[Apple]], we've just solved your crisis for you because obviously you were                    |
| 17:19      | having a crisis, not better.                                                                            |
| 17:21      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:22      | Fingers crossed, there'll be options to improve this a little bit further, which will be pretty         |
| 17:27      | good when we get them.                                                                                  |
| 17:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:30      | If I had my choice, I'd agree with you.                                                                 |
| 17:32      | I would have, if it was only one place, it would be focus mode.                                         |
| 17:35      | And that being said, when I choose a focus mode, it picks a specific watch.                             |
| 17:40      | I generate watch races for each focus mode, but I feel like I'm probably in the minority                |
| 17:45      | on that.                                                                                                |
| 17:46      | It's a little too geeky, you know, for most people.                                                     |
| 17:49      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 17:51      | I mean, I have different watch faces.                                                                   |
| 17:52      | So when my podcasting focus mode starts, it actually figures out which podcast I'm                      |
| 17:56      | recording.                                                                                              |
| 17:58      | And I've recently updated the way that I do that because the way I start my podcasting                  |
| 18:01      | focus modes is 99.9% of the time by clicking on a bunch action in my Mac menu bar.                      |
| 18:08      | And so it knows when I click record automators that I'm planning on recording automators,               |
| 18:13      | so it saves that into [[Data Jar]].                                                                         |
| 18:15      | And it just says, hey, she's recording automators.                                                      |
| 18:18      | And that means that I can just grab that information out of [[Data Jar]] and say, okay, this is where       |
| 18:22      | we're at.                                                                                               |
| 18:23      | All right.                                                                                              |
| 18:24      | Put that in your hat.                                                                                   |
| 18:25      | Yeah, we're going to get back to that.                                                                  |
| 18:27      | But what that means is then when that focus mode activates, I can look it up and I can                  |
| 18:32      | say, hey, if it's automators, set the watch face to this, stop shortcut.                                |
| 18:38      | So by the way, the stop shortcut thing, just to circle back to that, this is very useful                |
| 18:43      | for things like doing things like setting your watch face and so on.                                    |
| 18:48      | And what I would recommend if you're thinking, oh, but there's like three or four different             |
| 18:52      | things that I want to be able to do, so I can't use the stop shortcut action.                           |
| 18:56      | You can have a shortcut for setting the watch face and for setting your wallpaper or whatever           |
| 19:04      | it is.                                                                                                  |
| 19:05      | You can have multiple shortcuts and run multiple shortcuts within this, which is how I do it.           |
| 19:11      | Because then I can also reuse those shortcuts whenever I like, because a lot of those shortcuts,        |
| 19:16      | especially things like setting my watch face, those are on my Apple Watch as well, so that              |
| 19:20      | I can run them from the Apple Watch.                                                                    |
| 19:21      | I think a good rule of thumb with shortcuts is always, if you can break it down to a smaller            |
| 19:26      | unit, then do that.                                                                                     |
| 19:28      | Because it costs you nothing to make a shortcut that says run these two shortcuts.                      |
| 19:34      | It doesn't slow you down.                                                                               |
| 19:37      | And then you've got in components, and then you can call those components in different                  |
| 19:41      | shortcuts.                                                                                              |
| 19:42      | You can mix the ingredients together in different shortcuts, you only have to fix it in one             |
| 19:48      | place.                                                                                                  |
| 19:49      | It's just better all the way around.                                                                    |
| 19:51      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 19:52      | And also, just to note back previously, before we could run shortcuts without displaying                |
| 20:00      | them, the accepted way to make a shortcut faster was to wrap it in a run shortcut action                |
| 20:06      | in another shortcut, because then you would just watch the progress bar.                                |
| 20:09      | If you did the show while running option, then it was much slower.                                      |
| 20:14      | So yeah, it's quite nice that we still have that sort of thing around, because it really                |
| 20:21      | does make it a lot easier to use these things.                                                          |
| 20:24      | And also, when somebody says to me, hey, Rose, how do you deal with the watch face stuff?               |
| 20:29      | I don't have to send them a huge shortcut and say, ignore the first 350 actions.                        |
| 20:37      | You just want actions 351 to 358.                                                                       |
| 20:41      | I'd have to copy those out otherwise.                                                                   |
| 20:43      | So it's quite nice to just have it broken down like that.                                               |

| 20:59      | Drug stores can be really inconvenient.                                                                 |

| 22:26      | All right, Rose, before we get into what we're doing with focus mode, let's just talk about             |
| 22:33      | iOS 16 and focus modes.                                                                                 |
| 22:36      | I mentioned this briefly on the show during [[WWDC]], but I feel like now that it's shipped                 |
| 22:41      | we've got a much better idea of all the improvements to focus modes with iOS 16.                        |
| 22:48      | Where do you want to start?                                                                             |
| 22:50      | I want to start with the Sherlock Shortcuts Actions, which, to be clear, are still present              |
| 22:54      | in shortcuts.                                                                                           |
| 22:55      | But I feel like the fact that [[Apple]] have taken what a lot of people were doing with shortcuts           |
| 23:02      | related to the focus modes and brought that into the focus modes itself is, A, fabulous.                |
| 23:09      | I'm really pleased to see that they're clearly making the use of this anonymous feedback                |
| 23:13      | and data tracking that they get to see what people are doing, and B, it's just really                   |
| 23:18      | nice to know that I can set up a focus mode for, say, fitness, like my ballet classes                   |
| 23:25      | and so on.                                                                                              |
| 23:26      | I can choose my wallpapers, and I can choose my home screens, and I can choose my watch                 |
| 23:32      | face, and I can even do things like set low power mode and the appearance.                              |
| 23:38      | So my sleep focus mode uses low power mode because that also slows down things like push                |
| 23:42      | notifications and so on, and I don't care about push notifications from emails while                    |
| 23:46      | I'm asleep.                                                                                             |
| 23:47      | That's fine.                                                                                            |
| 23:48      | I'll get them when I wake up.                                                                           |
| 23:49      | That's the first I need here of them, and I always want to in dark mode, regardless                     |
| 23:53      | of when I'm sleeping, if I'm sleeping at two o'clock in the afternoon because I'm ill,                  |
| 23:58      | then I will be darkening the room as much as possible, and I do not want to be blinded                  |
| 24:03      | by a white iPhone screen if I happen to wake up and check it.                                           |
| 24:07      | So yeah, I'm really liking the fact that they've clearly been observing what people                     |
| 24:12      | have been asking for and doing and pulling that into the focus modes, and that clearly                  |
| 24:21      | has kicked off the start of the focus filters, but it's just really good to see that this               |
| 24:25      | has been put somewhere very, very obvious for people to use.                                            |
| 24:28      | Yeah, and the focus filters are already getting adopted by third-party applications.                    |
| 24:34      | So the big view of focus filters is when I go into a specific focus mode, I can give                    |
| 24:42      | instructions to system settings like dark versus light mode or applications as to what                  |
| 24:48      | information they display.                                                                               |
| 24:50      | The obvious examples are email and calendar apps.                                                       |
| 24:53      | So like if you have a focus mode related to work, you can say, only show me my work calendar.           |
| 25:00      | And the [[Apple Calendar]] app supported it, it's initially now fantastic, how it supports it.              |
| 25:05      | I'm sure some of the other third-party apps are already on the bandwagon, but the idea                  |
| 25:09      | is if I put myself in work focus mode, I don't see my personal calendar anymore, and I just             |
| 25:14      | see work.                                                                                               |
| 25:15      | And then the opposite, when I go home and I leave work mode, then the work calendar disappears,         |
| 25:19      | which is a great way to help keep yourself focused on what you should be doing as opposed               |
| 25:25      | to drag and work home with you.                                                                         |
| 25:27      | And then the other example of that is email, and you can have it say, only show me my work              |
| 25:32      | email account when I'm in work mode, and then when I leave work mode, don't show me my work             |
| 25:37      | account.                                                                                                |
| 25:38      | Have you ever had that happen to you, like where you're somewhere having fun and some                   |
| 25:42      | darkness inside of you causes you to open your email application and it just totally                    |
| 25:48      | chills your vibe?                                                                                       |
| 25:49      | Is that the right term?                                                                                 |
| 25:50      | Is that the right term?                                                                                 |
| 25:51      | It doesn't really happen to me, I have to say, because I'm very fortunate, I love my                    |
| 25:57      | job and the people I work with, I'm aware that I'm very lucky with that, but it definitely              |
| 26:04      | has happened, I've been on holiday at the airport and I'm still seeing messages and                     |
| 26:09      | stuff come in, and I know part of this is my fault for doing things like installing                     |
| 26:15      | work slack and stuff on my phone, and there's no obligation to, but it's nice that we are               |
| 26:21      | getting these filters through.                                                                          |
| 26:22      | There's something you've said there, David, can you have an email account not included                  |
| 26:28      | in the defaults, but then have it in the focus modes, because that's what I've been struggling          |
| 26:33      | with, because what I've been doing, and I'll just spoil people through what I've been doing             |
| 26:38      | so that they get a bit of an idea.                                                                      |
| 26:40      | So I go to the settings app, I open the focus section, and I go to the work option.                     |
| 26:47      | And bearing in mind, this is opt-in versus opt-out now for each focus mode.                             |
| 26:54      | So I've got it set up for times and places and so on.                                                   |
| 26:56      | And then I've set the filter inboxes to my specific inbox, which is great, but I don't                  |
| 27:02      | see a way to filter my inboxes by default when I'm not in a focus mode, unless I use                    |
| 27:09      | say a custom home screen icon, which I'm very open to doing.                                            |
| 27:12      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 27:13      | I'm not sure I understand your problem.                                                                 |
| 27:15      | So if you're going to work focus...                                                                     |
| 27:16      | Well, I don't want to see my work mail, or I don't want my work mail included in the                    |
| 27:21      | all mail boxes list when I'm not in my work focus mode.                                                 |
| 27:24      | Well, I haven't faced that because I actually have a personal focus mode, which we're going             |
| 27:29      | to find out about later.                                                                                |
| 27:32      | I'm in focus mode 24-7.                                                                                 |
| 27:35      | I have never quite got into that habit.                                                                 |
| 27:38      | And that is something that, again, I'm considering doing now because previously focus modes were        |
| 27:47      | you had to opt things into your focus mode.                                                             |
| 27:51      | And my problem with that is I had to opt too many things in to various focus modes and                  |
| 27:56      | can't continually update them.                                                                          |
| 27:58      | So the fact that the focus filters exist now means that this is going to be a lot easier,               |
| 28:03      | I think, because going back to your thing about the calendar, I'm also really pleased                   |
| 28:07      | to see third-party applications, including the Flexibits apps, CardHop and Fantastical,                 |
| 28:13      | both support focus mode filters.                                                                        |
| 28:15      | So I can have my filters, my contacts and calendar filtered in my preferred apps for exactly            |
| 28:25      | what I wanted, which is really nice because I already had calendar sets in Fantastical.                 |
| 28:30      | So I'm just able to reuse those, which is great.                                                        |
| 28:32      | I want to get back to this idea of inclusive versus exclusive filters because I think it's              |
| 28:37      | a huge deal.                                                                                            |
| 28:38      | But let's just, before we get there, on these focus filters, in addition to the ones Rose               |
| 28:43      | just mentioned, [[Drafts]] has focus filters.                                                               |
| 28:47      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                               |
| 28:48      | Because it's [[Drafts]] and it has focus filters.                                                           |
| 28:51      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 28:52      | I'm loving this.                                                                                        |
| 28:55      | If there is anything that you should expect from Agile Tortoise, it's that they do their                |
| 28:59      | absolute best to implement all the new iOS features as early as they possibly can.                      |
| 29:06      | And this was no exception.                                                                              |
| 29:08      | So [[Drafts]] allows you to filter by workspace, but not only by workspace, you can go further.             |
| 29:16      | So I should note that what you can do for a [[Drafts]] workspace, workspaces are their pro                  |
| 29:22      | features, is that you can say, hey, the workspace should be associated with this action group           |
| 29:30      | and this action bar group, the action bar being the bar that you would see above a digital              |
| 29:34      | keyboard on an iOS device or at the bottom of the screen on an iPad or similar with a                   |
| 29:39      | keyboard connected or the Mac, but you can override those if you want to.                               |
| 29:44      | So if you have the same workspace that you would use in a few different places, then                    |
| 29:49      | you can actually customise this and say, no, actually, in this particular case, I would                 |
| 29:54      | like to change the action group, the action list group or the action bar group to that.                 |
| 29:59      | And you can also have it open a particular draft.                                                       |
| 30:01      | I really like that idea.                                                                                |
| 30:04      | I'm considering making a packing focus mode, David, for when I'm packing to do various                  |
| 30:08      | things and it will pin the current draft at the top.                                                    |
| 30:14      | Well, that's what I need when I'm packing.                                                              |
| 30:17      | When I reopen [[Drafts]], it always needs to be the same draft unless I specifically open                   |
| 30:22      | another one.                                                                                            |
| 30:23      | And you can also even choose specific [[Drafts]], but it's pretty cool.                                     |
| 30:27      | I'm very much liking this.                                                                              |
| 30:29      | Yeah, so with [[Drafts]], not only can you have it open up the group of [[Drafts]] related to                   |
| 30:36      | work when you're in work focus mode, you can have a hide them and show your personal ones               |
| 30:40      | when you're in personal mode.                                                                           |
| 30:41      | And like Rose said, if you create custom actions in [[Drafts]], you can have only the custom actions        |
| 30:46      | related to work show up.                                                                                |
| 30:49      | I never expected [[Drafts]] or any notes app to take part in this feature, but of course                    |
| 30:55      | it was [[Drafts]].                                                                                          |
| 30:56      | And of course, you immediately see the benefit of it and yeah, yeah, you do.                            |
| 31:01      | There is another notes app, which I feel is worth a shout out for for this because they've              |
| 31:06      | added not only focus mode support, but they've also added shortcut support and that's agenda.           |
| 31:13      | Agenda previously was all in on the [[URL Schemes]] and they've still got those to be clear, but            |
| 31:19      | they have decided that they're implementing focus mode support so you can filter by categories.         |
| 31:23      | So you can create categories of projects and agenda, which is pretty nice.                              |
| 31:27      | So I've got, you know, my work category is selected obviously for work.                                 |
| 31:30      | And then of course, they've added shortcut support so that you can, you know, make the                  |
| 31:35      | most of more of these things.                                                                           |
| 31:37      | But I really like not only that you have all of the options that you can filter by and,                 |
| 31:44      | you know, there's other things that are here as well, like Noir has a focus mode filter                 |
| 31:50      | and you might be thinking wait what Noir it's it's the dark mode like browser extension                 |
| 31:55      | for [[Safari]].                                                                                             |
| 31:56      | Yes, it is, but you can set it that you can toggle it.                                                  |
| 31:59      | So if it's usually on auto, then you could set it to as explicitly on or off in certain                 |
| 32:04      | focus modes and you can choose the theme that it uses as well, but streaks the habit tracking           |
| 32:09      | app has support and focused the Pomodoro timer also has filter support for the session groups.          |
| 32:19      | But I think David, I think possibly my favourite one is [[Safari]] and those tab groups because              |
| 32:24      | I've been, I've been going all in on the tab groups.                                                    |
| 32:27      | I'm really liking it.                                                                                   |
| 32:28      | I did, I do keep getting caught out a little bit though, [[Safari Technology Preview]] and                  |
| 32:33      | [[Safari]] do not share tab groups.                                                                         |
| 32:35      | And this confuses me every once in a while because I will go to look for a tab group                    |
| 32:38      | on my Mac because I like to use [[Safari Technology Preview]] there.                                        |
| 32:42      | The purple icon may have something to do with that anyway, you know, and so, and I'll look              |
| 32:46      | for a tab group and be like, Hmm, where is it?                                                          |
| 32:49      | Oh, right.                                                                                              |
| 32:50      | I created it in [[Safari]] on my iPhone.                                                                    |
| 32:51      | So it's in [[Safari]], [[Safari]], not [[Safari Technology Preview]] [[Safari]], but it's, it's working pretty          |
| 32:55      | well.                                                                                                   |
| 32:56      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 32:57      | A couple of questions there.                                                                            |
| 32:58      | Is the [[Safari]] tab groups implementation with prior to Ventura max working with this?                    |
| 33:05      | Because yeah.                                                                                           |
| 33:06      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 33:07      | So I have been kind of holding off on tab groups because I wanted to wait until my,                     |
| 33:11      | my main machine was on Ventura, but I can't do that yet because, you know, betas and audio              |
| 33:16      | recording and [[ScreenFlow]], blah, blah, blah.                                                            |
| 33:20      | But the, but if it's, if it's compatible, then I need to actually dig into that.                        |
| 33:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 33:25      | The tab groups haven't changed themselves.                                                              |
| 33:27      | All that's happened, I say all, because clearly the folks over on the [[Safari]] team have been             |
| 33:31      | working super hard on this.                                                                             |
| 33:33      | They've just added about 16,000 shortcuts actions.                                                      |
| 33:37      | And of course they've got all of the, the, the focus mode filters, but you can access                   |
| 33:42      | a tab group, you know, at any stage, regardless of whether or not you're in a focus mode.               |
| 33:49      | So you'll need to set it manually on your Mac for the time being.                                       |
| 33:53      | But other than that, you know, it should be good to go.                                                 |
| 33:57      | I'm actually already seeing as well shared with you.                                                    |
| 34:00      | Oh, no way.                                                                                             |
| 34:01      | Shared with you is not the tab groups that have been shared with me.                                    |
| 34:03      | It's the links that have been shared with me.                                                           |
| 34:06      | Shared with you is getting an upgrade with, or got an upgrade with iOS 16 and we'll get                 |
| 34:12      | an upgrade with Mac OS Ventura, but obviously Ventura is not out yet, but I can see, you                |
| 34:18      | know, links that have been shared with me already, which is quite nice.                                 |
| 34:20      | I do like tab groups.                                                                                   |
| 34:21      | So I'm with you.                                                                                        |
| 34:22      | I think, and I think that, you know, this is a nice way again to limit what you see and                 |
| 34:28      | truly use a focus mode.                                                                                 |
| 34:30      | I want to go back to one other thing you blew past agenda.                                              |
| 34:34      | You're using an agenda, but you also use obsidian, and I think you use craft too.                       |
| 34:39      | Where does agenda?                                                                                      |
| 34:40      | I do not use craft.                                                                                     |
| 34:41      | I am.                                                                                                   |
| 34:42      | I'm not on the craft bandwagon, not because craft isn't good.                                           |
| 34:46      | It just doesn't work for my brain.                                                                      |
| 34:49      | Block editors like that where I can't just, you know, do whatever it is that I like with                |
| 34:54      | the text.                                                                                               |
| 34:55      | It, it drives me crazy for some reason, but I do use agenda.                                            |
| 34:59      | And agenda fits into my life basically because I create notes for just what is going on in              |
| 35:07      | my day at work of, hey, these are the things that I need to do on this day or that day                  |
| 35:11      | and so on.                                                                                              |
| 35:12      | And I just throw that in agenda because it's assigned to a specific day, which works really             |
| 35:18      | nicely.                                                                                                 |
| 35:19      | And then, yeah, I just, you know, basically end up having the information that I need                   |
| 35:26      | and I can go through it in a calendar style, so I can actually, I've created some [[Drafts]].               |
| 35:34      | I've got my own work [[Drafts]] action group, because of course I do, but it gives me the                   |
| 35:39      | option to say like, hey, so this thing that I was like scribbling down, like, it's not                  |
| 35:45      | super relevant to life particularly, like I don't need to keep this around, but I do                    |
| 35:49      | want to keep this around.                                                                               |
| 35:50      | So I'm going to save it into agenda with today's date on it, because if it's an agenda with             |
| 35:54      | today's date on it, then, you know, I'll be able to find it if I need to look for it in                 |
| 36:00      | the future.                                                                                             |
| 36:01      | Whereas if it's something that I'm going to keep around and it's like, it's in my personal              |
| 36:04      | reference system, then it goes into obsidian, but agenda is kind of like a cross between                |
| 36:10      | planning and logging what happened.                                                                     |
| 36:13      | And of course, when I create the agenda notes for a day, then I save, because agenda's got              |
| 36:19      | UUIDs for each note, so I save that UUID into [[Data Jar]], so that I can then, you know, look              |
| 36:26      | it up, because what happens when my work focus mode starts is it pings my push cut server.              |
| 36:32      | And the push cut server goes, hey, I'm going to find or create the agenda note for today.               |
| 36:37      | It looks in [[Data Jar]] to see if there is a [[Data Jar]] entry for today.                                     |
| 36:43      | And if there isn't, then it creates one with a little template that I've got another other              |
| 36:46      | than that, it just, you know, that's at the end of story.                                               |
| 36:49      | But that works pretty well for me.                                                                      |
| 36:51      | And it means that I just always have like a little place there where I can just dump                    |
| 36:54      | things.                                                                                                 |
| 36:55      | And if somebody says, like, oh, hey, would you mind doing this thing, then I've got a place             |
| 36:59      | to put it.                                                                                              |
| 37:00      | And yeah, that works well.                                                                              |
| 37:02      | So you're just tracking kind of work projects and communications, and it's a lot prettier               |
| 37:07      | than [[Obsidian]].                                                                                          |
| 37:08      | It's a lot friendlier on iPhone and iPad.                                                               |
| 37:10      | I get that.                                                                                             |
| 37:11      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 37:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 37:13      | So you have a pretty nice model as well where you buy updates for a period of time.                     |
| 37:19      | And then, you know, you'll get like all the new features and everything released during                 |
| 37:22      | that time.                                                                                              |
| 37:24      | And after, after you're done with it, then basically you can just like either continue                  |
| 37:30      | and pay for another year and get more cool new features and so on, or you can stop, but                 |
| 37:34      | you'll have all the features that you already had access to and like basic free updates                 |
| 37:38      | from then on.                                                                                           |
| 37:39      | So that's quite nice.                                                                                   |
| 37:40      | I want to go back to something.                                                                         |
| 37:42      | We have talked about a major change in, in focus modes that I think everybody needs to                  |
| 37:48      | understand is inclusive versus exclusive exceptions.                                                    |
| 37:52      | And though they are, they don't use such nerdy terms in shortcuts, but I'm sorry, in focus              |
| 37:59      | modes, but when you go to set a focus mode list of people, you can say silence notifications            |
| 38:05      | from these people.                                                                                      |
| 38:06      | So it's excluding certain people, certain people, or you can say allow notifications                    |
| 38:12      | from these people.                                                                                      |
| 38:14      | And so this solves a big problem because, you know, previously you had to specifically                  |
| 38:20      | allow each person and you may have some modes where you really only want to silence a few               |
| 38:28      | people and you're okay with the rest of the world.                                                      |
| 38:31      | Well, in order to do that, you had to sit there and manually pick every person in your                  |
| 38:36      | contact list.                                                                                           |
| 38:37      | That was not going to happen.                                                                           |
| 38:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 38:40      | So now you can do it where you can say, okay, for instance, like a personal mode for me                 |
| 38:45      | is one that was very difficult before I was 16 because personal mode means I'm generally,               |
| 38:51      | you know, game to talk to people.                                                                       |
| 38:53      | But if there's someone in my work life that's annoying, I can cut them out.                             |
| 38:58      | So that's where I would use the silence from these people option.                                       |
| 39:02      | And they have the similar feature for apps.                                                             |
| 39:05      | So you can say let all apps through except these or only let these apps through and so                  |
| 39:10      | suddenly you've got two ways to look at each focus mode, which to me is a complete game                 |
| 39:15      | changer.                                                                                                |
| 39:16      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 39:17      | And it's the same for apps, right?                                                                      |
| 39:18      | So you can say like, hey, I just don't want notifications from these apps now.                          |
| 39:22      | Thank you very much.                                                                                    |
| 39:24      | But everything else is good because that was my biggest problem with focus modes before.                |
| 39:27      | Not only did I have to sit there for ages and manually go through and pick out all of                   |
| 39:31      | the contacts or, you know, do, you know, whatever it was.                                               |
| 39:36      | But I then had to continually update it, download a new app and enable notifications.                   |
| 39:41      | Don't forget to update your focus modes, add a new contact, don't forget to update your                 |
| 39:46      | focus modes.                                                                                            |
| 39:47      | And that is something that's very easy to do.                                                           |
| 39:49      | And the thing that for me, unfortunately is still kind of the real killer is that I can't               |
| 39:54      | just blank it, allow the no caller ID.                                                                  |
| 39:59      | And I get why I can't just say like, no caller ID always gets through because for most people,          |
| 40:04      | this would be problematic.                                                                              |
| 40:05      | But there are a few services in my life, like my doctor's surgery being one of them, which              |
| 40:10      | when it calls you calls from no caller ID.                                                              |
| 40:13      | And that just makes my life very, very difficult when it comes to, you know, the focus modes            |
| 40:19      | with the phone app.                                                                                     |
| 40:20      | I have tried blank it allowing the phone app and I'll need to borrow, I guess I'll borrow               |
| 40:24      | my mom's phone this weekend, and we'll hold the caller ID before dialing myself and just                |
| 40:30      | see what happens when I do that and see if it still comes through because if it does,                   |
| 40:36      | then I can start using, you know, personal focus modes for more than I already have.                    |
| 40:42      | But it's pretty great.                                                                                  |
| 40:44      | I'm very pleased at this little combination of things that we now have for our focus modes              |
| 40:50      | because you've got your lock screen, which you've got, you know, your different wallpapers,             |
| 40:55      | you've got different widgets.                                                                           |
| 40:56      | So I have different widgets showing me different information for, you know, personal versus             |
| 41:02      | work things versus, you know, when I'm in my fitness focus mode and so on.                              |
| 41:07      | And you know, and your watch faces and then, you know, allowing more disallowing apps.                  |
| 41:12      | And that for me works really well.                                                                      |
| 41:14      | It's just so much more powerful and there's so much more you can do with it.                            |
| 41:18      | There's a couple other new features, but I'd like to talk about those as we go through                  |
| 41:21      | our actual focus modes.                                                                                 |
| 41:24      | Let's do that next.                                                                                     |
| 41:25      | Sounds good to me.                                                                                      |

| 41:32      | When you work in a small team, every moment counts, you don't want to be wasting your                   |
| 41:35      | time finding video conferencing details to send to a new client and you don't want to                   |
| 41:38      | be tracking down the same FAQs from the company website.                                                |
| 41:42      | These are the kinds of things you want your fingertips so you can get your work done faster             |
| 41:46      | and that's why you need TextExpander.                                                                   |

| 42:10      | within TextExpander.                                                                                    |
| 42:12      | Then create your chosen abbreviation and they'll be with you wherever you type.                         |
| 42:16      | You can even customise the snippets by having them automatically add in dates, fill in the              |
| 42:20      | blank fields, timestamps and more.                                                                      |
| 42:22      | This will make sure that you still keep the personality and the communication you send.                 |
| 42:26      | TextExpander is available on any device you own across any app you use on Mac, Windows,                 |
| 42:31      | Chrome and iOS.                                                                                         |
| 42:33      | One of the things I love using TextExpander for is making sure I use the right name for                 |
| 42:37      | whatever it is I'm trying to do.                                                                        |
| 42:39      | So sometimes things change in terminology and we need to start getting used to the new                  |
| 42:44      | names.                                                                                                  |
| 42:45      | One of the ways that I make sure I do this is by just updating my snippets.                             |
| 42:48      | It can be the same if you move house, change email address or, you know, update your phone              |
| 42:52      | number.                                                                                                 |

| 43:02      | That's textexpander.com/automators to say goodbye to repetitive typing.                           |
| 43:06      | Well, thanks to TextExpander for their support of this show.                                            |
| 43:10      | Okay, the first thing I guess we should say is that there's a limit on the number of focus              |
| 43:15      | modes you can install.                                                                                  |
| 43:17      | It's 10.                                                                                                |
| 43:18      | Yep.                                                                                                    |
| 43:19      | I don't know why.                                                                                       |
| 43:20      | It doesn't seem to me like there's really a good reason to limit it to 10.                              |
| 43:24      | Like I would like to have a focus mode for each of my podcasts, but I can't because I                   |
| 43:29      | don't have room for them.                                                                               |
| 43:31      | But the, but Rose and I are both, you know, we are both abusers.                                        |
| 43:36      | So we both have 10 focus modes and I thought it'd be fun.                                               |
| 43:41      | Let's just go through them and explain anything.                                                        |
| 43:45      | What we're using them for, how we've set them up, any kind of fun automation or other cool              |
| 43:49      | things we're using to make them work for us.                                                            |
| 43:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 43:53      | So I guess we should start with just the good old list, right?                                          |
| 43:56      | Of what our focus modes are and then we can circle back because we're going to have overlap             |
| 44:00      | in some areas, right?                                                                                   |
| 44:01      | Like we've both got a sleep focus mode, I'm guessing.                                                   |
| 44:04      | That seems to me like, you know, we're definitely going to have that.                                   |
| 44:08      | And I also have a driving focus mode.                                                                   |
| 44:11      | And I've already mentioned my fitness one several times.                                                |
| 44:15      | Obviously there's podcasting in here.                                                                   |
| 44:19      | The do not disturb one won't go away.                                                                   |
| 44:21      | That just exists always.                                                                                |
| 44:23      | And then there, I also have holiday is in like, I'm on vacation reading, screencasting.                 |
| 44:32      | And yeah, I believe this list of my focus modes now that I've covered, I don't quite                    |
| 44:36      | have 10, but almost.                                                                                    |
| 44:38      | What about you, dude?                                                                                   |
| 44:39      | What's your list?                                                                                       |
| 44:40      | Do not disturb and avoid it.                                                                            |
| 44:43      | Deep focus, which I'll get back to, Disneyland, driving, personal podcasting, production,               |
| 44:51      | reading, sleep and work.                                                                                |
| 44:53      | Excellent.                                                                                              |
| 44:54      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 44:55      | So we've definitely got some overlap there.                                                             |
| 44:57      | And I feel like we need to start at the end of the day with the sleep because this is                   |
| 45:00      | the one that's going to be common to everyone and just see what we've got there with our                |
| 45:05      | settings and what we're doing.                                                                          |
| 45:08      | So I should note for anybody who goes, well, I don't really like the sleep feature that's               |
| 45:13      | built into the health app because it's, you know, got the specific schedule in.                         |
| 45:17      | And that is the only way you can schedule sleep focus mode as a side note.                              |
| 45:21      | Don't forget you can, of course, manually enable and disable focus modes at any time.                   |
| 45:26      | And you can also use enabling a focus mode as a trigger.                                                |
| 45:31      | And so what happens for me when I enable focus modes, or at least my sleep focus mode, and              |
| 45:37      | this is a little bit of a sneaky trick that I do, is I use a focus mode to check basically              |
| 45:46      | what kind of thing it is that's triggering.                                                             |
| 45:50      | So say it's my sleep focus mode.                                                                        |
| 45:52      | At the weekends, I don't have an alarm set.                                                             |
| 45:54      | And if I go to bed late, well, I need to make sure I get enough sleep.                                  |
| 45:58      | So my sleep mode triggering or turning on is a trigger.                                                 |
| 46:03      | And then if it's the weekend, if there isn't a wake up alarm set, then what it does is                  |
| 46:07      | it turns my sleep focus mode on for eight hours so that it won't just continually be                    |
| 46:15      | on all weekend.                                                                                         |
| 46:16      | But you can turn a focus mode on that's already on to set it to have a specific end time.               |
| 46:21      | So that's a little workaround that I have there.                                                        |
| 46:25      | But I've obviously gone with a nice dark theme.                                                         |
| 46:28      | So I've got the moon wallpaper as my wallpaper.                                                         |
| 46:32      | And I've got some customised home screens, which have got things like my Oura sleep tracking.            |
| 46:36      | I've got an Oura fitness ring on there.                                                                  |
| 46:39      | And then I've got a custom [[Drafts]] group, which has very few things in there on purpose                  |
| 46:46      | just so that I can't see what I've already been creating.                                               |
| 46:49      | So if I'm making notes, then it'll only be the things that I've created overnight.                      |
| 46:55      | Noir sets everything to dark mode.                                                                      |
| 46:57      | The appearance is set to dark.                                                                          |
| 46:58      | Low power mode is on.                                                                                   |
| 46:59      | And I'm filtering my calendar sets as well.                                                             |
| 47:02      | But I haven't excluded or included people just because they don't really get through anyway.            |
| 47:08      | Or it says it's literally not allowing them from anybody, from any app or from any person               |
| 47:15      | just because when I'm in sleep focus mode, I should be sleeping.                                        |
| 47:17      | I don't want any notifications.                                                                         |
| 47:20      | So that's kind of what mine looks like to start with, David.                                            |
| 47:24      | What about you?                                                                                         |
| 47:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 47:26      | This is one of my simpler focus modes.                                                                  |
| 47:29      | I do let people through, but it's like my kids, my wife, and my sisters.                                |
| 47:35      | It's just people who would call me if there was an emergency.                                           |
| 47:39      | And when you have kids, it's really hard to ever not let them through.                                  |
| 47:43      | So I have some people that get through, but I also have in there, it turned on to allow                 |
| 47:49      | repeat calls will ring it through.                                                                      |
| 47:51      | So if someone calls multiple times and I go up and down there, there's a feature there                  |
| 47:57      | where you can say, well, also allow anybody that's in your favourites.                                   |
| 48:01      | And I've currently got that turned on.                                                                  |
| 48:03      | So if Rose called me two in the morning, my phone would ring.                                           |
| 48:06      | But the...                                                                                              |
| 48:07      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 48:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 48:09      | I've actually got those settings as well.                                                               |
| 48:10      | That would be the people section where I've not explicitly opted anybody else in there.                 |
| 48:13      | It's only my favourites.                                                                                 |
| 48:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 48:15      | And really, that's overlap for me.                                                                      |
| 48:17      | If I turn favourites on, I don't need to create carve outs for my immediate family because               |
| 48:21      | they're already in my favourites.                                                                        |
| 48:23      | But this is one of the simpler ones.                                                                    |
| 48:24      | I don't put on custom screen.                                                                           |
| 48:27      | I had done that for a while where I had the Kindle app in there and a big analog clock                  |
| 48:33      | widget.                                                                                                 |
| 48:34      | And so if I wake up and I look at my phone, it'll give me nighttime related apps.                       |
| 48:40      | But then I realise, you know, if I look at that screen at two in the morning, I've already              |
| 48:45      | lost the battle.                                                                                        |
| 48:46      | So I don't try to make it attractive to me to look at the screen at two o'clock in the                  |
| 48:51      | morning.                                                                                                |
| 48:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 48:53      | And I don't sleep with my watch on every night.                                                         |
| 48:55      | I do that occasionally and I just haven't decided it.                                                   |
| 48:57      | Now that I have the super battery, maybe I'll do it more often.                                         |
| 49:02      | But the default sleep watches, watch face is already good.                                              |
| 49:06      | So this one is one of the easier focus modes for me in terms of, you know, features that                |
| 49:11      | I'm using.                                                                                              |
| 49:12      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 49:13      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 49:14      | So for me, on the lock screen itself, I actually do have some widgets because I have just like          |
| 49:21      | a quick one to create a draft because that way I can just very quickly like, right, there's             |
| 49:29      | a thing in my brain.                                                                                    |
| 49:30      | It needs to get out of the brain and needs to be somewhere where it will be found.                      |
| 49:35      | And so I've got a new draft one.                                                                        |
| 49:39      | I also have the you're asleep icon and then I've got one for my alarm so that I will know,                  |
| 49:48      | you know, like what alarm is going to be going off.                                                     |
| 49:51      | I think it was the alarm.                                                                               |
| 49:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 49:53      | The next alarm.                                                                                         |
| 49:54      | I've got the large next alarms in there, which of course has to go on the left.                         |
| 49:58      | And then I've just changed the date at the top to also have the weather in there just                   |
| 50:02      | because if I'm waking up a little bit early in the morning, you know, it's nice to see                  |
| 50:05      | what that is.                                                                                           |
| 50:07      | And yeah, so I've got a little bit of extra stuff there, but nothing too crazy.                         |
| 50:14      | It was mostly just about like allowing me before I go to sleep to see how I slept the                   |
| 50:18      | night before on the home screen and so on because I've got custom widgets and so on                     |
| 50:23      | for that.                                                                                               |
| 50:24      | So that's quite nice to have.                                                                           |
| 50:26      | I think we're good with that one.                                                                       |
| 50:27      | Do you want to talk for a minute about the reading one that's another one that we both                  |
| 50:32      | had?                                                                                                    |
| 50:33      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 50:34      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 50:35      | So my reading focus mode is pretty simple.                                                              |
| 50:40      | It turns on or I have it ask me to turn on when I open, say, the Books app or the Kindle                |
| 50:51      | app, but it doesn't automatically turn on because I do pop into those apps to check various             |
| 50:59      | things.                                                                                                 |
| 51:00      | There's reference books in there, but I do have an NFC tag on my Kindle case, which I                   |
| 51:05      | can tap my phone to and that does just automatically, it toggles my focus mode status.                  |
| 51:10      | So if my focus mode is on, then it turns it off and if it's off, it turns it on.                        |
| 51:15      | And basically, all I do is really is the home screen that I have.                                       |
| 51:22      | It's the weather one, but I have it dim that weather one.                                               |
| 51:26      | So it's showing me the weather and everything, which is quite nice.                                     |
| 51:32      | But then I have that dimmed option, which is, you know, it's just quite nice to have                    |
| 51:38      | that dim lock screen feature so that it's not quite so enticing and attractive compared                 |
| 51:43      | to everything else.                                                                                     |
| 51:44      | I don't have notifications silenced.                                                                    |
| 51:46      | I don't have notification badges silenced.                                                              |
| 51:49      | The people, what I did is I went into the notifications and I changed it to silence notifications       |
| 51:55      | from and I did the same with apps.                                                                      |
| 51:58      | There are potentially some apps which may end up going into that silence list, but if                   |
| 52:03      | it's something that I don't want disturbing me while I'm reading, then it's probably going              |
| 52:06      | to lose its notification privileges full stop.                                                          |
| 52:10      | So yeah, I don't really have a lot else going on there.                                                 |
| 52:17      | I have looked at doing the other focus filters, but until the Books app and the Kindle app              |
| 52:22      | maybe get some options to let me customise a shelf or category of books that I'm looking                |
| 52:29      | at, I don't think I really need to filter a whole lot there.                                            |
| 52:32      | Oh, one thing I do do.                                                                                  |
| 52:34      | I change my watch face as well.                                                                         |
| 52:35      | I have a reading watch face, which is the Duo one, so I get the time in two colours,                     |
| 52:42      | which is quite nice.                                                                                    |
| 52:43      | But other than that, there's not a lot there.                                                           |
| 52:45      | What about you, David?                                                                                  |
| 52:46      | Okay.                                                                                                   |
| 52:47      | I do once again have a people filter on and something I didn't mention earlier as I look                |
| 52:52      | at this is the allow calls from is separate from allow people to notify you.                            |
| 53:00      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 53:01      | And that's one of the shortfalls of the current iteration of focus modes is that you need               |
| 53:07      | to manually add the people and I know it's better with the inclusive versus exclusive                   |
| 53:11      | list, but I really think they should allow you to use contact groups just like they use.                |
| 53:16      | You can use favourites or calls, but you can't say allow all favourites to give me notifications          |
| 53:23      | or anybody in my clients folder can give me notifications, but nobody else can.                         |
| 53:28      | I mean, there's a lot of ways you could slice and dice it using the calendar groups.                    |
| 53:33      | I'm sorry, the address book groups and they don't give you that ability.                                |
| 53:38      | So like for instance, when I let my wife notify me on almost any focus mode, I just have to             |
| 53:44      | manually add her, but my wife and kids are group that I almost always allow through.                    |
| 53:50      | Wouldn't it be great if I could just say, you know, nuclear family or some, you know,                   |
| 53:54      | like a small group with just those people in it or fellow podcasters for you, [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]]                   |
| 53:59      | and [[Mike Schmitz\|Mike]], and I can't do that.                                                                          |
| 54:02      | I've got to go through manually add.                                                                    |
| 54:03      | So I don't really like that.                                                                            |
| 54:05      | No, I do wish that it was a little better because when you go to add, if you look in                    |
| 54:10      | the contacts view in the top left, there is lists.                                                      |
| 54:12      | So you can go back and you're like, great, I can choose a list.                                         |
| 54:15      | And then you tap on a list and you select the people in it.                                             |
| 54:19      | And that to me is quite sad, especially if you work somewhere which has an address book                 |
| 54:24      | that automatically updates, you know, the people that you probably need to be talking                   |
| 54:29      | to during your working hours.                                                                           |
| 54:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 54:31      | Yeah, that doesn't automatically update with iOS.                                                       |
| 54:33      | I have filed that as feedback before.                                                                   |
| 54:36      | And so, you know, I'm kind of just waiting, I guess, for somebody on the focus mode filter              |
| 54:43      | contacts team to pick that one up and do that, but it would be really nice to have that be              |
| 54:47      | a dynamic group that updates.                                                                           |
| 54:50      | So.                                                                                                     |
| 54:51      | Fingers crossed.                                                                                        |
| 54:52      | I have a custom home screen for this and it's got the Kindle app on it.                                 |
| 54:58      | It's got the Audible app.                                                                               |
| 55:00      | It's got the Apple books.                                                                               |
| 55:02      | It's got [[Obsidian]] there because I take a lot of notes in [[Obsidian]] as I'm reading books.                 |
| 55:07      | A lot of times I see something that adds to an idea so I can just go in there and do it.                |
| 55:13      | I also have the reader with two E's app in there.                                                       |
| 55:15      | So I kind of consider reading RSS in the same kind of context as reading.                               |
| 55:22      | And I do actually, I'm pretty careful about, you know, letting people through again because             |
| 55:29      | if I've taken time to read, I don't really want somebody calling me to talk about, you                  |
| 55:33      | know, changing the tires on the car or whatever.                                                        |
| 55:36      | So there's that.                                                                                        |
| 55:38      | I set the appearance to dark with the appearance filter because I just kind of like that when           |
| 55:45      | I'm reading and it just kind of once again helps me get there.                                          |
| 55:49      | And I have a simple watch face with no notifications on it.                                             |
| 55:54      | I really like the meditation watch face, kind of the blue shaded one.                                   |
| 55:59      | And it doesn't show the date or anything.                                                               |
| 56:02      | It just puts the time on my watch face and I kind of like having that as well.                          |
| 56:06      | So, you know, when I read, I kind of want to back away, you know, it's like, you know,                  |
| 56:11      | when you hear people who just like a Kindle because no interruptions, well, I kind of                   |
| 56:14      | create a new interruption machine using focus mode and my devices.                                      |
| 56:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 56:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 56:21      | That makes a lot of sense.                                                                              |
| 56:22      | And, you know, I might have to look into the custom home screen for reading.                            |
| 56:27      | You know, I already have things like [[Drafts]] and so on on my home screen, which I'm going                |
| 56:31      | to make any note.                                                                                       |
| 56:32      | I'm going to make it in [[Drafts]] and then send it where it needs to live afterwards.                      |
| 56:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 56:36      | That's the reason you talked about that with sleep mode.                                                |
| 56:38      | That's the same thing I have in my dock.                                                                |
| 56:41      | I have like a choose from menu shortcut list and the top one is new draft.                              |
| 56:47      | So that's the way I was triggered.                                                                      |
| 56:48      | I don't really need to create a special slot for it on the home screen, but it's there.                 |
| 56:53      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 56:54      | One thing you mentioned I actually want to call attention to is dim.                                    |
| 56:58      | The lock screen is actually a very powerful feature now.                                                |
| 57:01      | People don't realise.                                                                                   |
| 57:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 57:03      | Now with the iPhone 14 Pro, it when you put it into always on mode, it does display kind                |
| 57:10      | of like a darker version of your wallpaper, and it seems like a lot of people don't like                |
| 57:16      | that.                                                                                                   |
| 57:17      | I mean, just listening to a couple of podcasts and reading the last couple of days, that                |
| 57:21      | seems to be a feature that is not landing well with a lot of people, I think.                           |
| 57:25      | It does continually confuse me.                                                                         |
| 57:27      | I keep looking down on my phone thinking, oh, right, I forgot to turn my phone off and                  |
| 57:32      | then realise, no, it's the home screen.                                                                 |
| 57:35      | And then today, I managed to leave my phone unlocked on my desk all day long on, like,                  |
| 57:42      | I swiped into the notification centre.                                                                  |
| 57:44      | I don't have my phone auto lock most of the time because I'm just at home and it's only                 |
| 57:48      | me around.                                                                                              |
| 57:49      | But yeah, I left it on the notification screen all day because it was full of brightness.               |
| 57:54      | It was on charge, at least, because I forgot to lock it because I keep getting confused.                |
| 57:58      | Is it locked?                                                                                           |
| 57:59      | Is it not locked?                                                                                       |
| 58:00      | But this dim home screen feature is available whether or not you use the custom settings.               |
| 58:04      | It's just in the options.                                                                               |
| 58:06      | And that is very nice.                                                                                  |
| 58:08      | Just means that, like, I've got, for podcasting, the wallpaper is the black one with the coloured        |
| 58:14      | sort of bubbles that float around.                                                                      |
| 58:16      | And those bubbles are nearly indistinguishable when my dim home screen, dim lock screen filter          |
| 58:22      | is on, which is just great.                                                                             |
| 58:24      | I really like that.                                                                                     |
| 58:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 58:26      | And as an example, I use the [[SF Symbols]] of the microphone in the centre of the screen                   |
| 58:31      | for my podcast home screen.                                                                             |
| 58:33      | And so when I look at my dock, and even when it's, the always on is on and it's dimmed.                 |
| 58:38      | When I see that microphone, I'm like, okay, I'm podcasting right now.                                   |
| 58:42      | And that's, that's kind of a good way to keep my brain on task.                                         |
| 58:45      | I actually like it.                                                                                     |
| 58:46      | I do think that if you're out there and you, you're trying it and you're not totally satisfied          |
| 58:51      | with it, I would really recommend give it a couple of weeks because I, I've had 10 days                 |
| 58:56      | with this phone as we record the show.                                                                  |
| 58:59      | I'm totally used to it now.                                                                             |
| 59:00      | It doesn't bother me.                                                                                   |
| 59:01      | I don't like mistake it and I kind of like it, but if you don't like it, if you decide                  |
| 59:06      | you really don't like it, you can go in focus modes and throw the switch for dim lock screen.           |
| 59:11      | And when you do that, the effect is the wallpaper disappears.                                           |
| 59:15      | And so if you're in podcast mode and I put it on the dock and it goes to always on mode,                |
| 59:21      | I'll see the time and I'll see my widgets and I'll see the date, but I won't see the                    |
| 59:26      | wallpaper and you can do that for all of your focus modes.                                              |
| 59:29      | And then you don't have wallpaper on, you're always on screen display anymore.                          |
| 59:33      | I mean, that's, that's a solution.                                                                      |
| 59:35      | It's probably the best solution at this point.                                                          |
| 59:37      | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 59:38      | And I have to say it is really nice because if you are, you're in a focus mode, then that               |
| 59:42      | shows at the bottom of the screen as well, along with a number of notifications that                    |
| 59:46      | you have.                                                                                               |
| 59:47      | So you can see like, Hey, there's something that needs my attention potentially, but                    |
| 59:50      | it's still not screaming at you going, Hey, me over here.                                               |
| 59:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 59:55      | The thing that's lit up.                                                                                |
| 59:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 59:57      | Me over here.                                                                                           |
| 59:58      | Hey, hey, hey, how are you today?                                                                       |
| 59:59      | You know, quite understated.                                                                            |
| 01:00:00   | I found that I'm being a bit more selective about my wallpapers now, which is possibly                  |
| 01:00:05   | not the effect that [[Apple]] intended with the whole, you know, fancy new lock screen with                 |
| 01:00:10   | the, the portrait mode.                                                                                 |
| 01:00:13   | So, you know, we'll have to see how that goes.                                                          |
| 01:00:17   | But for me, I found the, you know, darker wallpapers with, with pops of colour on them                   |
| 01:00:22   | are working very well in combination with this sort of thing.                                           |
| 01:00:26   | But yeah, I will have to try out the personal focus mode filter a bit more, which I'm wondering         |
| 01:00:32   | maybe David, we should talk personal focus mode next.                                                   |
| 01:00:38   | This episode of the automators podcast is brought to you by electric.                                   |

| 01:00:54   | Being a small business into an empire takes work and you have to keep your ear to the                   |
| 01:00:58   | ground for things that will help you take it to the next level.                                         |
| 01:01:02   | But this can be hard when your attention is pulled in different directions because that's               |
| 01:01:06   | the reality of being a boss.                                                                            |
| 01:01:08   | The team over at electric knows small businesses, maybe like yours, face these challenges.              |
| 01:01:13   | That's why they've solved this problem for you by operating as your IT department instead               |
| 01:01:18   | of spending your time sorting through unused application licenses, setting up employee                  |
| 01:01:23   | laptops and answering never ending IT questions from your team.                                         |
| 01:01:27   | You can build that empire with electric acting as your IT department.                                   |
| 01:01:32   | You can get back to what you're good at.                                                                |
| 01:01:33   | Plus, you get a really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                                   |
| 01:01:37   | One of the most important things to learn as you start your small business is the importance            |
| 01:01:42   | of delegation.                                                                                          |
| 01:01:43   | And just because you can do everything doesn't mean you should do everything.                           |
| 01:01:47   | And IT is one of those things that you should definitely delegate.                                      |
| 01:01:51   | Your employees don't need you provisioning their laptops.                                               |
| 01:01:54   | They need you planning how to make the business successful.                                             |
| 01:01:57   | For automators listeners, Electric is offering a free pair of Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones          |
| 01:02:02   | for taking a qualified meeting.                                                                         |
| 01:02:04   | Talk to them.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:05   | Get them to help you out.                                                                               |
| 01:02:06   | Go to electric.ai/automators.                                                                     |
| 01:02:09   | Once again, that's electric.ai/automators.                                                        |
| 01:02:12   | Go there now and get your free pair of Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones today for scheduling            |
| 01:02:17   | a qualified meeting.                                                                                    |
| 01:02:19   | And our thanks to Electric for their support of the automators.                                         |
| 01:02:22   | Okay, we're going to talk personal mode.                                                                |
| 01:02:26   | So mine is something that's very inclusive, as opposed to historical focus modes for me                 |
| 01:02:33   | being very exclusive.                                                                                   |
| 01:02:37   | This is where I set silence notifications from specific people.                                         |
| 01:02:42   | And it's a varying list.                                                                                |
| 01:02:45   | Because people become annoying to me, I add them to the list.                                           |
| 01:02:49   | Currently there is nobody on the list.                                                                  |
| 01:02:52   | So to all my friends, my challenge is to stay off my silence list.                                      |
| 01:02:57   | But don't get on David's naughty list.                                                                  |
| 01:03:00   | There was somebody, there's a group of people on there up until a few days ago on something             |
| 01:03:04   | I was working on and that's over.                                                                       |
| 01:03:06   | So I was able to remove them.                                                                           |
| 01:03:08   | They're never going to call me.                                                                         |
| 01:03:11   | Same thing with apps, but you can still choose apps to remove.                                          |
| 01:03:15   | So my personal mode really isn't there to be the type of focus mode that you would historically         |
| 01:03:22   | think about.                                                                                            |
| 01:03:23   | Something that can really cut down on the amount of notifications you get.                              |
| 01:03:26   | But what it does do is it allows me to say, okay, now I'm in personal mode and I get all                |
| 01:03:31   | of the benefits of being in a focus mode.                                                               |
| 01:03:34   | So I can have custom home screen, custom wallpaper, custom watch face.                                  |
| 01:03:39   | For me, my personal colour is orange.                                                                    |
| 01:03:43   | So I have a watch face with orange highlights in it and I have a home screen with an orange             |
| 01:03:49   | background and kind of personal, like that's where the [[Instagram]] app suddenly appears on                |
| 01:03:56   | my home screen.                                                                                         |
| 01:03:59   | And I really like the idea of everywhere I look, there's orange and I'm realising, hey,                 |
| 01:04:05   | it's orange.                                                                                            |
| 01:04:06   | I'm in personal mode now.                                                                               |
| 01:04:07   | And then that just gives me the power to dim things if I want, you know, all the stuff                  |
| 01:04:11   | we were talking about earlier that you're facing because you don't use a personal mode.                 |
| 01:04:16   | My point is it doesn't have to be super, you know, highly indexed focus mode.                           |
| 01:04:22   | It can be a very general open one, but it still gives you all the benefits of having                    |
| 01:04:26   | a focus mode.                                                                                           |
| 01:04:27   | And like when I go to do podcasting, green, everything turns green.                                     |
| 01:04:32   | When I do MacSparky work, everything turns gray or blue.                                               |
| 01:04:37   | I'm trying to decide.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:38   | Actually, I'm thinking about switching from blue to gray on that one, but I like this                   |
| 01:04:41   | idea of the watch face, the home screen, the iconography, everything just like switches.                |
| 01:04:47   | And then whatever, whenever I look at any of my devices, it's a reminder of what I'm doing,             |
| 01:04:53   | you know, and like, oh, it's green right now.                                                           |
| 01:04:56   | I look at my watch face, it's green.                                                                    |
| 01:04:58   | I'm podcasting.                                                                                         |
| 01:04:59   | That's what I need to be putting my brain to right now.                                                 |
| 01:05:02   | And so that's why I did one for personal mode.                                                          |
| 01:05:06   | It's not super fancy as far as focus modes go, but it's mere existence allows me to keep                |
| 01:05:12   | in context.                                                                                             |
| 01:05:13   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:14   | And I think that's the key, isn't it?                                                                   |
| 01:05:16   | You know, it's really just being able to get rid of the things that you don't necessarily               |
| 01:05:22   | want coming in all the time.                                                                            |
| 01:05:26   | And that for me, for a long time, you know, my problem has been, you know, like, I am                   |
| 01:05:31   | happy to have my work email and work [[Slack]] on my phone, but there are times when I do                   |
| 01:05:36   | not want to be bothered by said work email and work [[Slack]], you know, most of the time                   |
| 01:05:40   | it's fine.                                                                                              |
| 01:05:41   | You know, if somebody does ping me in the evening, then it's because that there's a problem.            |
| 01:05:45   | They probably need me to be seeing this first thing in the morning, but they don't know                 |
| 01:05:48   | when first thing in the morning is necessarily going to be for me.                                      |
| 01:05:52   | And so, you know, it's nice to be able to see that, but equally, I don't want to have                   |
| 01:05:56   | to see that all the time.                                                                               |
| 01:05:58   | And so, I mean, I've already created, you know, I've got the holiday focus mode or it's                 |
| 01:06:04   | kind of a vacation mode, it's explicitly set up for like I am in the process of traveling,              |
| 01:06:10   | which is similar to this, but I think I need to revisit the personal focus mode again and               |
| 01:06:15   | look at this some more because I really want notifications from the vast majority of my                 |
| 01:06:19   | apps and the vast majority of people.                                                                   |
| 01:06:22   | And you know, I just want things like when I open mail, I want it to filter my inbox                    |
| 01:06:27   | to not include work and so on so that I just don't have to deal with that.                              |
| 01:06:33   | So I'm very much hoping that I'll be able to install macOS Ventura day one on my Macs                   |
| 01:06:38   | and then I can just enjoy this feature everywhere once we get it on this.                               |
| 01:06:44   | Yeah, that is one of the complications right now is, you know, this that they didn't get                |
| 01:06:49   | everything released at the same time.                                                                   |
| 01:06:51   | So you've got different machines.                                                                       |
| 01:06:55   | Just real quick side note, what is keeping you off Ventura on your production machines?                 |
| 01:07:01   | Well, for the podcasting side of things is mostly I just, I definitely want everything                  |
| 01:07:07   | working.                                                                                                |
| 01:07:08   | I don't want any problems with anything.                                                                |
| 01:07:09   | And I know the [[Rogue Amoeba]] apps are working now, but they, they always say, you know,                  |
| 01:07:16   | like stay off the betas because, you know, we're not going to support them day one.                     |
| 01:07:21   | It will probably crash or do something because the audio drivers get monkey with every year             |
| 01:07:26   | thanks to [[Apple]].                                                                                        |
| 01:07:27   | And so they have to go deal with that.                                                                  |
| 01:07:30   | And in general, it's just a case of, it's a bit more difficult to river a Mac back                      |
| 01:07:35   | if there's a big problem with something, you know, like restoring a backup on iOS.                      |
| 01:07:42   | It's not convenient, but it's fine.                                                                     |
| 01:07:44   | Restoring it on macOS, a lot trickier.                                                                  |
| 01:07:48   | So yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm in the holding passion of, am I ready?                                 |
| 01:07:53   | Maybe I should do it.                                                                                   |
| 01:07:54   | I probably shouldn't do it.                                                                             |
| 01:07:55   | I'm going to regret it.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:56   | If I do it, I'll just do it.                                                                            |
| 01:07:57   | No, I'm not going to do it because I'm in the middle of doing this thing and I really                   |
| 01:07:59   | need my machine to work.                                                                                |
| 01:08:00   | Because that's the other thing.                                                                         |
| 01:08:01   | You have to give it a couple of hours to install the big updates.                                       |
| 01:08:04   | So yeah, I'm currently waiting, but I don't know.                                                       |
| 01:08:08   | Maybe this weekend will be the weekend and I'll just install it on one of my machines.                  |
| 01:08:12   | I do have a laptop running the beta just for beta things, which is good fun.                            |
| 01:08:17   | I've got some beta wraps on there that I've been trying out for folks, but yeah, I'm not                |
| 01:08:21   | quite got there on the main machines yet.                                                               |
| 01:08:24   | The big hold up for me is [[ScreenFlow]].                                                                  |
| 01:08:26   | They just don't update until the thing releases and that may not even be immediate, but they're         |
| 01:08:34   | very clear.                                                                                             |
| 01:08:35   | They're not going to have an open public beta.                                                          |
| 01:08:38   | They're just going to deal with it when [[Apple|Apple's]] done.                                                   |
| 01:08:44   | So that's a problem because I do a lot of screen casting related to personal is one                     |
| 01:08:49   | that I have that's even more focused.                                                                   |
| 01:08:51   | It's the Disneyland one.                                                                                |
| 01:08:53   | And this one kind of comes from a specific problem.                                                     |
| 01:08:56   | He talked about being interrupted in your personal time by work.                                        |
| 01:09:01   | And for me, some of the most sacred time for me is Disneyland.                                          |
| 01:09:06   | We spend all this money on these passes and it's like a place that my family and I go                   |
| 01:09:11   | to where we are all super engaged with each other.                                                      |
| 01:09:15   | Talking to each other.                                                                                  |
| 01:09:16   | I mean, there's nothing better than a long line to sit in with your kid and find out                    |
| 01:09:21   | what they're thinking about for their career or what their hardest class is.                            |
| 01:09:26   | It's like when you get stuck in line and you just talk, you find you talk to each other.                |
| 01:09:32   | And I've had that experience where I've been at Disneyland and got a text from a client                 |
| 01:09:37   | or some kind of problem arose that somebody put on my plate that just totally diverted                  |
| 01:09:43   | me and I should be better at being able to set that aside.                                              |
| 01:09:46   | But once I know the problem exists, my brain immediately, at least at some level starts                 |
| 01:09:51   | engaging with it.                                                                                       |
| 01:09:52   | So where I'm very liberal when I'm in personal mode about letting stuff through with exception,         |
| 01:09:59   | I'm very exclusive when I'm at Disneyland.                                                              |
| 01:10:03   | I use the trick you turn me on to of using multiple locations to trigger the mode, you                  |
| 01:10:08   | know, because you can do it, you know, I can, it triggers in the parking structure in the               |
| 01:10:12   | park.                                                                                                   |
| 01:10:13   | So I've got all these places.                                                                           |
| 01:10:14   | That's super reliable.                                                                                  |
| 01:10:15   | I've been doing that for a year and even worked on iOS 15.                                              |
| 01:10:19   | So when I'm at Disneyland, it just enters focus mode for Disneyland.                                    |
| 01:10:23   | It changes my wallpaper to a picture of the castle.                                                     |
| 01:10:25   | I was thinking, I need to change out to the Millennium Falcon, I think, but either way.                 |
| 01:10:30   | And then the app list that shows up is very specific, like I have the battery widget on                 |
| 01:10:36   | my screen.                                                                                              |
| 01:10:37   | I never have the battery widget on my screen.                                                           |
| 01:10:38   | But when you're at Disneyland, you want to know the status of your various batteries.                   |
| 01:10:42   | Although maybe I don't need to worry about my watch anymore.                                            |
| 01:10:46   | Hourly forecast, analog clock, all the various Disney related apps and the exclusivity is               |
| 01:10:56   | very tight, you know.                                                                                   |
| 01:10:58   | There's only certain people get through.                                                                |
| 01:10:59   | Suppose you're on my list, you get through Disneyland, but there's just a couple of people              |
| 01:11:05   | and it's basically my family, my podcast partners, which I guess you could argue I should cut           |
| 01:11:11   | you guys out that if you text me about a problem, I shouldn't hear about it while I'm there.            |
| 01:11:16   | But if, you know, there's a problem with an ad or something I need to know.                             |
| 01:11:20   | And then, and that's not the kind of problems I'm really insuring against.                              |
| 01:11:25   | This was more of a legal thing than what I'm doing now.                                                 |
| 01:11:28   | And then it's an interesting list because anybody that meets me at Disneyland, I put                    |
| 01:11:31   | them in the inclusive, like, you know, James Dempsey and I meet there pretty often and                  |
| 01:11:37   | he's in it.                                                                                             |
| 01:11:38   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:39   | So it just depends on, you know, who I'm going with in my family.                                       |
| 01:11:42   | But I like having that be a very exclusive personal list and the, you know, the advantages              |
| 01:11:49   | I go there and I generally am able to engage with the time we have there and not get caught             |
| 01:11:55   | up with things.                                                                                         |
| 01:11:56   | And that's the exact purpose of these focus modes.                                                      |
| 01:11:58   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:00   | I think that's the thing.                                                                               |
| 01:12:01   | That's one of the reasons why I have the travel focus mode, which, you know, I've called                |
| 01:12:05   | it holiday because that's what us Brits call vacation.                                                  |
| 01:12:08   | But, you know, I have this setup and it's using that really awesome.                                    |
| 01:12:15   | What is it?                                                                                             |
| 01:12:16   | The colourful like rainbow, I think it's, it's called, it's called the Pride lock screen.                |
| 01:12:23   | And I love that one.                                                                                    |
| 01:12:25   | It's awesome.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:27   | And you can, I really love the fact that they, that it's really good at suggesting photos               |
| 01:12:31   | as well on the lock screen because I've just gone into this to check what I was using.                  |
| 01:12:36   | And it's suggesting that I use some of the photos I took when I was on holiday in New                   |
| 01:12:40   | York, which is an excellent idea.                                                                       |
| 01:12:42   | And I should look into doing that.                                                                      |
| 01:12:44   | I have that one because it's really bright.                                                             |
| 01:12:47   | And the last thing you want to do when you're in the middle of traveling is accidentally                |
| 01:12:50   | leave your phone somewhere.                                                                             |
| 01:12:52   | So like my solution to this problem is basically, you know, like I'm, I'm just going to make            |
| 01:12:58   | my phone as bright as possible for this.                                                                |
| 01:13:01   | And then the actual settings, it allows certain apps through.                                           |
| 01:13:04   | So it'll allow airline apps.                                                                            |
| 01:13:05   | Like I've just got all of the airline apps permanently installed and the Tripit app as                  |
| 01:13:10   | well.                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:11   | Flighty is also on the list, obviously.                                                                 |
| 01:13:15   | And then, you know, phone calls for my favourites and my parents.                                        |
| 01:13:18   | And again, you're in there, David, along with Micah and Scotty, just because, you know,                 |
| 01:13:24   | if something podcasting comes up while I'm traveling, you know, it's probable that I'm                  |
| 01:13:27   | going to be able to answer you and say something about it, even if I can't necessarily do something     |
| 01:13:31   | about it at that moment.                                                                                |
| 01:13:33   | And yeah, it's also just, you know, nice for, it sets my watch face as well.                            |
| 01:13:40   | It was previously using the XL watch face, but I think I'm going to change that to the,                 |
| 01:13:47   | the Duo one with the tickles, because that's still nice and easy to read.                               |
| 01:13:53   | But it doesn't really do any of the other filters, though that said, I have got a travel                |
| 01:13:59   | calendar set.                                                                                           |
| 01:14:00   | So I've just added that into the Folk Fantastical filters so that I can reuse my travel calendar        |
| 01:14:07   | set.                                                                                                    |
| 01:14:08   | And it is actually, there is a draft focus filter that I have set up for because I have                 |
| 01:14:14   | a packing slash travel workspace in [[Drafts]].                                                             |
| 01:14:19   | I mean, I have two workspaces.                                                                          |
| 01:14:20   | I have a packing workspace and I have a travel workspace, but the travel workspace includes             |
| 01:14:26   | everything in the packing workspace.                                                                    |
| 01:14:28   | So yeah, so that's filtered just to allow me to quickly and easily see that and make                    |
| 01:14:34   | any notes.                                                                                              |
| 01:14:35   | But I've just basically done it just to try and get rid of notifications from certain                   |
| 01:14:40   | apps like the [[Slack]] for enterprise app is excluded here so that I don't get notifications               |
| 01:14:45   | from work.                                                                                              |
| 01:14:46   | And I've filtered my email inbox as well.                                                               |
| 01:14:48   | So I guess I should, you can't duplicate these, but you can recreate them and I should                  |
| 01:14:54   | do that or modify my personal one to be much more inclusive than it currently is much more              |
| 01:15:01   | similar to that.                                                                                        |
| 01:15:02   | I should add, you know, early when I talked about my coloured, you know, colour focus modes               |
| 01:15:07   | so I can look at my watch or whatever and get immediate notification of what I should                   |
| 01:15:12   | be doing is that I have recently switched to the infograph analog face as my primary                    |
| 01:15:19   | watch face because it gives you a lot of options and it looks horrible in the samples, but              |
| 01:15:25   | you can actually tone it down quite a bit to where it doesn't look like there's a party                 |
| 01:15:30   | going on on your wrist.                                                                                 |
| 01:15:32   | And then I've got each one focused on colour like the Disneyland focus mode has yellow,                  |
| 01:15:40   | which looks like Mickey's shoes.                                                                        |
| 01:15:42   | That's how I picked it and I didn't have to use yellow for anything else, but so it's                   |
| 01:15:47   | just, you know, I think with the, because one thing we haven't really focused on today                  |
| 01:15:52   | is you can attach watch faces to these, but I find that having generally the same watch                 |
| 01:15:59   | face, but different features on the watch face to be a really smart way to use these.                   |
| 01:16:04   | Like when I'm in the Disneyland focus mode, like I've got complications for air quality                 |
| 01:16:10   | index and the temperature and things that I don't normally need to see, but when I'm                    |
| 01:16:15   | there I do.                                                                                             |
| 01:16:16   | Like I have a stopwatch on there because for whatever reason, Daisy and I are obsessed                  |
| 01:16:21   | with timing lines.                                                                                      |
| 01:16:23   | Like if anything there to wait for Disneyland, we always want to see, because they always               |
| 01:16:26   | tell you like, oh, this is a 45 minute wait, and then when you find out it was a 20 minute              |
| 01:16:31   | wait, you know, I don't know, it's just weird, but the, but I put it on the watch face because          |
| 01:16:35   | I can access it quickly.                                                                                |
| 01:16:36   | And that's kind of the fun of setting up focus modes.                                                   |
| 01:16:39   | It's like, oh, what am I going to do when I'm, you know, what, what, what I really like                 |
| 01:16:44   | on my watch face when I am podcasting versus at Disneyland.                                             |
| 01:16:47   | And like I said earlier, when I podcast, I get the local time in London because I know                  |
| 01:16:53   | this really nice lady who's really good at automation and she happens to be in the London               |
| 01:16:58   | time zone.                                                                                              |
| 01:16:59   | So I want to keep track of, you know, what time it is for you when we record.                           |
| 01:17:03   | And I have also one for Memphis, which happens to be the same thing as Wisconsin for Mike,              |
| 01:17:07   | but I just, I just like kind of customising the faces to match what I need when I'm doing               |
| 01:17:13   | that job.                                                                                               |
| 01:17:14   | And I find that, I don't know why I'm smiling as I say this because it kind of makes me happy.          |
| 01:17:19   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:17:20   | So I really like it as well and the fact that it's so easy because I mean, when, when we                |
| 01:17:26   | first got the, the shortcuts actions that could trigger when you trigger to focus mode,                 |
| 01:17:29   | I think a lot of people immediately went watch face time and they were doing that, but it               |
| 01:17:34   | was kind of crashy and it didn't work consistently and reliably in some cases, which was a real         |
| 01:17:39   | shame.                                                                                                  |
| 01:17:40   | And over, you know, over the course of iOS 14 and 15, that's got better.                                |
| 01:17:45   | And I'm impressed with, you know, the fact that the watch face thing is, is a lot better                |
| 01:17:49   | because the problem when your focus mode turns on, that does not guarantee that your watch              |
| 01:17:53   | is near your phone, right?                                                                              |
| 01:17:55   | You know, the, the phone could be on the chair in the other room and I'm sitting here at                |
| 01:18:00   | my desk podcasting with you.                                                                            |
| 01:18:01   | It's not because I brought it in here for the focus modes, but, you know, I have been                   |
| 01:18:06   | known to leave my phone in the other room and then a focus mode triggers and especially                 |
| 01:18:11   | if it's an automated trigger, then, you know, the chances that your phone is near your watch,           |
| 01:18:17   | well, it depends on who you are, right?                                                                 |
| 01:18:19   | But for some people that's going to be much lower than others, if it's not near enough,                 |
| 01:18:22   | then it can't actually do that.                                                                         |
| 01:18:24   | So it's going to look for the watch and try, but there's only so much it can do when it,                |
| 01:18:29   | when it tries to do that.                                                                               |
| 01:18:30   | So yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm really impressed with how much this has improved to the point that               |
| 01:18:35   | [[Apple]] of, you know, borrowed from the shortcut team and pulled it into the focus modes itself           |
| 01:18:40   | because they've, they've been able to, to set that up to be a bit more consistent and                   |
| 01:18:44   | that is just great.                                                                                     |
| 01:18:46   | And I'm really enjoying the fact that all of this has, you know, really pulled together                 |
| 01:18:51   | and you can go further as well and you can change your focus mode filters through shortcuts,            |
| 01:18:58   | which to me is, I'm not quite sure yet how I will be using the set of focus mode filters                |
| 01:19:06   | because at least the last time I tried it, and this was a few iOS's ago, I'll, I'll note,               |
| 01:19:12   | you know, point versions in the beta scheme.                                                            |
| 01:19:15   | It changed them permanently for me.                                                                     |
| 01:19:19   | And I don't know if you've had that same thing, David, where you use the, the action.                   |
| 01:19:25   | So every focus, every app that has a focus mode filter gets a free shortcut section for                 |
| 01:19:30   | set focus mode filters.                                                                                 |
| 01:19:33   | And you know, so I could pick, say the, I'll pick the, I'll grab the, the strings one.                  |
| 01:19:40   | That seems good.                                                                                        |
| 01:19:42   | And so I can set, so I can either turn on a streaks focus mode filter off, toggle it                    |
| 01:19:48   | or clear it or just set it while in, and then you choose your focus mode, right?                        |
| 01:19:54   | So I could set my streaks focus mode filter while I'm in sleep to a particular category                 |
| 01:19:58   | and I'll select, say my health tasks.                                                                   |
| 01:20:00   | But then when I run this, it will run it, but that's not for today's sleep mode.                        |
| 01:20:07   | And now if I go into the settings, it has, I'm just double checking to make sure it has,                |
| 01:20:12   | it's actually, yeah, it changed it.                                                                     |
| 01:20:15   | Like it was previously set to my sleep tasks, which are like they, they're not really asleep            |
| 01:20:21   | tasks.                                                                                                  |
| 01:20:22   | It's just a, or sorry, timed tasks is what it was set to.                                               |
| 01:20:26   | And so it just changes it permanently.                                                                  |
| 01:20:29   | And I, I don't know what the purpose of these actions is other than maybe exposing                      |
| 01:20:37   | things to Siri as well and somebody checked a checkbox somewhere to put it in shortcuts                 |
| 01:20:41   | because that seemed like a good idea.                                                                   |
| 01:20:44   | And I mean, I guess if you change all, you can't even change all these to ask, oh, you                  |
| 01:20:52   | can.                                                                                                    |
| 01:20:53   | So you can change this to ask each time.                                                                |
| 01:20:54   | So you could have it run through the apps that you want to filter and, you know, set                    |
| 01:21:01   | all of the focus modes for sleep or work or something, but you're going to have to change               |
| 01:21:06   | that focus mode every time or ask each time and hope that you don't mistap.                             |
| 01:21:12   | So yeah, I'm, I'm not sure yet how I'm going to use that.                                               |
| 01:21:15   | Maybe we'll get a, an extension to this action in the not too distant future, right?                    |
| 01:21:20   | Of set the focus mode for like this focus so that like until it turns off, set it to                    |
| 01:21:28   | this.                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:31   | I'd also really like to see more of the [[Apple]] apps hop on this bandwagon, you know, [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]]           |
| 01:21:35   | is an obvious candidate with the lists.                                                                 |
| 01:21:38   | And you know, the artwork one, actually, it would be quite nice to say like, hey, like                  |
| 01:21:42   | folders, like these folders are the folders that I like want to be like the default folders             |
| 01:21:47   | that pop up when I open the keynote app or the pages app or numbers app or something.                   |
| 01:21:55   | And so on, you know, that, that would be, you know, quite nice.                                         |
| 01:21:59   | And you know, I guess we'll see, I feel like 1Password could fit in there as well because            |
| 01:22:04   | in the 1Password eight app, they've got the new feature for the, what are they called                |
| 01:22:08   | vault groups, collections, they're called collections and you can collect vaults.                       |
| 01:22:15   | And so you can put like two or three or more vaults together to say like, okay, this is                 |
| 01:22:18   | a collection.                                                                                           |
| 01:22:19   | So I've got like mine and then I've got like family, which includes the things that I've                |
| 01:22:23   | shared with my family.                                                                                  |
| 01:22:26   | So you know, because we have shared vaults and stuff, but I've also got a work vault                    |
| 01:22:30   | and my work collection doesn't, it includes like my personal shared stuff, which I have                 |
| 01:22:34   | available for me personally as well as at work, but it, it doesn't have like the majority               |
| 01:22:40   | of my personal stuff in there and it would be nice to automatically change the, the collection          |
| 01:22:44   | for things like that.                                                                                   |
| 01:22:46   | So I guess we're going to see what happens with all of this, but you know, there's certainly            |
| 01:22:53   | a lot that's already been done, which is great.                                                         |
| 01:22:55   | Yeah, and like, I could see future apps like [[Apple]], why not bring notes into the game?                  |
| 01:23:01   | You know, just like graph seed, you could have a display folder or I can move a tag                     |
| 01:23:06   | filter.                                                                                                 |
| 01:23:07   | There's a several ways you could do it.                                                                 |
| 01:23:10   | And then the other thing is this new app Freeform, which we haven't seen yet, seems                     |
| 01:23:14   | like a natural candidate for this where, you know, if you're working on Freeform collaborative          |
| 01:23:19   | work, you could have personal ones versus work ones and then have focus mode filter it                  |
| 01:23:25   | for you depending on your context.                                                                      |
| 01:23:28   | Have you ever thought about starting your own business, creating a brand, sharing a                     |

| 01:25:01   | We still have more focus modes to talk about, but I wanted to take a brief interlude to                 |
| 01:25:06   | talk about how you're triggering focus modes.                                                           |
| 01:25:08   | And I'm going to go first because I know that you've got some fairly complex automations                |
| 01:25:13   | you've done for this.                                                                                   |
| 01:25:14   | I've tried that, you know, like I've written scripts that have calendar events trigger                  |
| 01:25:18   | focus mode.                                                                                             |
| 01:25:19   | So when I start podcasting and it goes into focus mode, but I keep coming back to the                   |
| 01:25:24   | manual process.                                                                                         |
| 01:25:25   | This is one for, for whatever reason, I don't think I want to automate it.                              |
| 01:25:30   | I think the process of triggering the focus modes and [[Apple]] makes it trivially easy.                    |
| 01:25:35   | Like you can swipe up on the watch and there it is.                                                     |
| 01:25:38   | You push a button or up in the menu bar in the Mac or down in the tool control centre                   |
| 01:25:43   | on the iPhone and iPad, but they make it really easy to set, to set them.                               |
| 01:25:47   | And I find that the process of turning it on manually kind of helps my brain engage                     |
| 01:25:52   | with what, you know, with the transition to the new focus.                                              |
| 01:25:56   | Does that make sense?                                                                                   |
| 01:25:57   | Yeah, it does.                                                                                          |
| 01:25:59   | And honestly, a lot of the time, you know, my focus modes are triggered semi-manually.                  |
| 01:26:04   | And I say semi-manually because it'll be another action that I personally take, which then              |
| 01:26:09   | causes an automation to trigger my focus mode for me.                                                   |
| 01:26:13   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:26:14   | But, you know, like I've, so I have a shortcut section or a shortcut actually for each focus            |
| 01:26:20   | mode that turns on that focus mode.                                                                     |
| 01:26:22   | And the entire purpose of this is to make it much easier on macOS to turn on a focus                    |
| 01:26:26   | mode.                                                                                                   |
| 01:26:27   | And that way I can then use a bunch or [[Keyboard Maestro]] or any app basically to turn on my              |
| 01:26:35   | focus mode.                                                                                             |
| 01:26:38   | And they can even pass data into this.                                                                  |
| 01:26:41   | And if they do pass data in, what I do when these, because these shortcuts accept input,                |
| 01:26:48   | if there is input, then I turn it on for the provided number of hours.                                  |
| 01:26:53   | And so, you know, if my podcasting focus mode receives the guest podcast trigger, that one              |
| 01:27:01   | actually pops up and asks me, like, hey, you know, like, how long do you want this to be                |
| 01:27:06   | on for?                                                                                                 |
| 01:27:07   | And when I say this pops up and asks me, I mean, I have a bunch, ask me how long I want                 |
| 01:27:11   | to do, be in the podcasting focus mode for, you know, if I'm guessing on clockwise, that's              |
| 01:27:16   | one thing, you know, that clockwise is 30 minutes or less every time.                                   |
| 01:27:20   | But if I'm guessing on another show, then it might take longer.                                         |
| 01:27:23   | So a bunch will pop up and ask me, and the reason why I have bunch asked me for this                    |
| 01:27:28   | is because it also has the `caffeinate` command.                                                          |
| 01:27:31   | And that means that then it will stay awake for that period of time.                                    |
| 01:27:37   | So that my Mac won't go to sleep while I'm podcasting.                                                  |
| 01:27:40   | And then it passes that data into the shortcut as well.                                                 |
| 01:27:44   | But what I do have in some other cases, of course, you know, you've got the Disneyland                  |
| 01:27:48   | location triggers.                                                                                      |
| 01:27:50   | I have location triggers for some things like my fitness one, which is triggered at my ballet           |
| 01:27:57   | studio and things like that.                                                                            |
| 01:28:00   | But other than that, it's pretty much just built, build it into something else so that                  |
| 01:28:05   | I can have the thing that I do anyway trigger the focus mode rather than me having to manually          |
| 01:28:12   | do it.                                                                                                  |
| 01:28:13   | But yeah, I think for me, the biggest automations come with the focus modes turning on because          |
| 01:28:19   | the focus mode is turning on is still a big thing for me personally.                                    |
| 01:28:26   | And you know, I mentioned this before, when my sleep focus mode triggers, it checks if                  |
| 01:28:29   | there is a wake up alarm.                                                                               |
| 01:28:30   | If there is no wake up alarm, or it also checks actually, so if there is a wake up alarm,               |
| 01:28:39   | it will check to see if tomorrow is a holiday.                                                          |
| 01:28:41   | And if it is, then it turns off the wake up alarm.                                                      |
| 01:28:45   | And why say tomorrow?                                                                                   |
| 01:28:46   | I mean, the day when I wake up, or the day that will be in eight hours.                                 |
| 01:28:50   | So I just add eight hours to it, and then, you know, and just see if that day is a holiday.             |
| 01:28:57   | And then, you know, after that, you know, if there is, you know, if there is an alarm                   |
| 01:29:03   | and it's not a holiday, then that's it, the shortcut ends, stop shortcut.                               |
| 01:29:08   | Other than that, it then turns on my sleep focus mode again.                                            |
| 01:29:11   | So my sleep focus mode was already on, but it turns it on again for eight hours.                        |
| 01:29:15   | And this means it doesn't re-trigger the shortcut to run.                                               |
| 01:29:19   | That doesn't happen.                                                                                    |
| 01:29:20   | It just runs once because it's already on, but then it will be on for eight hours and                   |
| 01:29:25   | then automatically turn off because otherwise it will turn off for me.                                  |
| 01:29:29   | So you know, that is, I think, one of my favourites that I have.                                         |
| 01:29:36   | But yeah, podcasting obviously checks which podcast I'm going to run, or I should be recording.         |
| 01:29:42   | But you know, I should really disable that because I've, you know, had the realisation                  |
| 01:29:47   | that when I start a particular podcast through Bunch, I can just have it give a shortcut                |
| 01:29:53   | the data of which podcast I'm recording based on which entry I've clicked in the menu.                  |
| 01:29:59   | And just store that in [[Data Jar]] to use as, you know, information to share across my devices             |
| 01:30:04   | and, you know, update things if necessary so that I can have a different watch phase                    |
| 01:30:09   | for automators versus say, nested folders, because that's quite fun having different                    |
| 01:30:13   | watch phases for different podcasts, even though the actual focus modes are the same.                   |
| 01:30:18   | Yeah, I need to, I need to crack that and that figure out a good way to have the watch                  |
| 01:30:23   | phase dependent on the show, you know, like, so I could make it colour dependent, but I'm                |
| 01:30:28   | just so used to green means podcasting that there's part of me that's resistant to, to                  |
| 01:30:32   | making it more complicated.                                                                             |
| 01:30:34   | But you cover two things there.                                                                         |
| 01:30:36   | The first one is triggering focus mode as part of another automation.                                   |
| 01:30:40   | I think that's the most flexible because like you said, you can use keyboard and maestro                |
| 01:30:44   | or basically choose your poison and you can trigger a focus mode.                                       |
| 01:30:48   | We've talked about this on the show.                                                                    |
| 01:30:49   | There are so many ways to do it.                                                                        |
| 01:30:51   | And that to me is the same thing as triggering it manually in the sense that if I'm manually            |
| 01:30:54   | triggering an automation, it has the same effect.                                                       |
| 01:30:56   | So I think that works.                                                                                  |
| 01:30:58   | And then you've got the reverse of that when you trigger a focus mode, you know, when you               |
| 01:31:03   | throw the switch on your watch, then a shortcut is triggered that does other things.                    |
| 01:31:07   | Now that's more limited because it only arises from a shortcut.                                         |
| 01:31:12   | But as we've all seen shortcuts is becoming more powerful and shortcuts is now getting                  |
| 01:31:17   | the ability to control other stuff, particularly on your Macs.                                          |
| 01:31:19   | I think either way works.                                                                               |
| 01:31:21   | That second option of where you trigger a focus mode and that triggers a shortcut was                   |
| 01:31:27   | very unreliable when they first released it a year and a half ago, but now it's rock solid.             |
| 01:31:32   | I use it on several and it, it's just not a problem anymore.                                            |
| 01:31:36   | I don't think about it.                                                                                 |
| 01:31:37   | It just happens.                                                                                        |
| 01:31:39   | Although I would recommend don't try and make them like shortcuts that ask for input                    |
| 01:31:45   | and things.                                                                                             |
| 01:31:46   | Oh, no.                                                                                                 |
| 01:31:47   | That gets in the way and, and depending on what device you're on, it may not work right.                |
| 01:31:51   | So you've got to be smart about what instructions you're giving it, but it really is pretty,            |
| 01:31:56   | pretty solid.                                                                                           |
| 01:31:57   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:31:58   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:31:59   | One of the things that I actually do is I have the, so the trigger is like going to                     |
| 01:32:05   | be controlled by my iPhone.                                                                             |
| 01:32:06   | So my iPhone, like my personal regular daily iPhone is the one that will be like, Hey,                  |
| 01:32:12   | your work focus mode is turned on.                                                                      |
| 01:32:13   | I'm going to run this shortcut.                                                                         |
| 01:32:16   | But it doesn't actually run the shortcut.                                                               |
| 01:32:19   | And this, this is the little trick that I have been working on.                                         |
| 01:32:22   | I actually have it tell my push cut automation server to run the shortcut.                              |
| 01:32:29   | And all of the shortcuts I run on my push cut automation server do not require input.                   |
| 01:32:33   | Like they don't want me to do anything because the idea is that this phone just kind of sits            |
| 01:32:37   | in a corner and does its thing all day every day.                                                       |
| 01:32:40   | And it, you know, will do whatever it is that needs doing, and that makes it a lot easier.              |
| 01:32:48   | And the fact that I already had that kind of mental model of, right, so if it's like,                   |
| 01:32:53   | I'm, I'm going to have this thing and it's going to run and I am not going to be near                   |
| 01:32:56   | it.                                                                                                     |
| 01:32:57   | I'm not going to touch it.                                                                              |
| 01:32:58   | I'm not even going to see it happening.                                                                 |
| 01:32:59   | It's just going to do the thing.                                                                        |
| 01:33:00   | Like I had that set up in my head already.                                                              |
| 01:33:02   | So I've been able to transition that to the automations very well.                                      |
| 01:33:07   | You know, if something has the ask before running toggle, then sure, I'll let it ask                    |
| 01:33:12   | me for input.                                                                                           |
| 01:33:13   | But other than that, I'm not going to let it ask me for input because it's, yeah, it's                  |
| 01:33:16   | just going to end up with me failing to notice that my, my phone or my watch was asking me              |
| 01:33:22   | for information.                                                                                        |
| 01:33:23   | And now I have a shortcut that just didn't finish running.                                              |
| 01:33:27   | All right.                                                                                              |
| 01:33:28   | So we're running a little long.                                                                         |
| 01:33:29   | I'd like to just kind of go through a bit of a speed around with what we've got left.                   |
| 01:33:34   | The first one for me is kind of a grouping that's work and deep focus.                                  |
| 01:33:38   | Now work is, you know, the work focus, it's a classic one.                                              |
| 01:33:42   | And I've got a home screen on there that shows like my hot list in OmniFocus.                           |
| 01:33:48   | It shows today's date with a calendar list from Fantastic House.                                        |
| 01:33:51   | So my widgets and everything are planned around work stuff and work apps.                               |
| 01:33:56   | My watch face turns currently blue.                                                                     |
| 01:33:59   | Like I said, I'm really thinking about changing that to gray, but, you know, it turns into              |
| 01:34:02   | work mode.                                                                                              |
| 01:34:03   | My, my, my lock screen also gives me work stuff.                                                        |
| 01:34:07   | And I only let apps through that relate to work.                                                        |
| 01:34:11   | And this is a bit of an evolution.                                                                      |
| 01:34:13   | I do check the notifications that came in that, that got blocked out.                                   |
| 01:34:17   | And if I see ones, I'm like, oh, I should have received that.                                           |
| 01:34:19   | Then I'll go ahead and add the app.                                                                     |
| 01:34:21   | Same thing with people.                                                                                 |
| 01:34:23   | But as it stands with my work mode, I've got a grouping of about 12 people.                             |
| 01:34:30   | So that's a pretty liberal grouping for me that gets through.                                           |
| 01:34:34   | And you know, it's, it's all the podcasters, the editors, the people I work with for sparking           |
| 01:34:38   | media of a family.                                                                                      |
| 01:34:39   | And so I don't mind because I'm working, you know, and they want to get through to me.                  |
| 01:34:43   | They should get through.                                                                                |
| 01:34:45   | Whereas deep focus for me really cuts down.                                                             |
| 01:34:49   | There is a bit of confusion in my brain and between deep focus and do not disturb mode                  |
| 01:34:54   | because I'm definitely getting close to do not disturb.                                                 |
| 01:34:58   | But then there are a few things I let through in deep focus that I wouldn't let and do not              |
| 01:35:02   | disturb.                                                                                                |
| 01:35:03   | And deep focus is just what it sounds like.                                                             |
| 01:35:06   | It's like, okay, I really need to drill in.                                                             |
| 01:35:08   | I've got this two hour calendar block to deal with this problem.                                        |
| 01:35:12   | I don't want to be interrupted unless it's really important.                                            |
| 01:35:15   | And so that is a much more exclusive list.                                                              |
| 01:35:18   | But those two kind of work together for me.                                                             |
| 01:35:21   | And again, there is a bit of a thing going on with the chemicals in my brain.                           |
| 01:35:24   | When I, when I push the button for deep focus, it's like, okay, Sparky, it's all                        |
| 01:35:28   | on, you got two hours, do this thing, you know, you got no excuse now.                                  |
| 01:35:34   | And I like that, I kind of like that pairing.                                                           |
| 01:35:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:35:40   | So when you say two hours there, are you triggering this with like, turn it on for two hours option?    |
| 01:35:45   | You know, if you open the focus modes in the control centre on your phone and if you tap                |
| 01:35:50   | those three dots on the right hand side, then you get to say, hey, I want to turn this                  |
| 01:35:53   | on for an hour or until tomorrow morning until I leave my current location or until like                |
| 01:35:59   | the end of this event.                                                                                  |
| 01:36:02   | Or you can just, you know, turn it on.                                                                  |
| 01:36:05   | And you know, that that's how I would usually control something like that, or are you using             |
| 01:36:11   | a specific automation to trigger it for a period of time?                                               |
| 01:36:15   | Or what are you doing?                                                                                  |
| 01:36:16   | Yeah, you would think that I was using automation, I make a podcast called the automators, but          |
| 01:36:20   | I don't.                                                                                                |
| 01:36:21   | This is a ritual.                                                                                       |
| 01:36:23   | I like the ritual of it, I like turning on deep focus.                                                  |
| 01:36:27   | And then when I'm done with the project, turning it off, you know, there's something to that.           |
| 01:36:33   | It's like, okay, now I can go out and pull weeds or take the dog for a walk or whatever.                |
| 01:36:38   | It's just like the way sometimes manually starting timers has an effect on you to allow                 |
| 01:36:44   | you to really kind of dig in onto what you just committed to.                                           |
| 01:36:49   | Using deep focus is like, it's like it, you know, and I don't think, I think, you know,                 |
| 01:36:55   | using automation for this makes sense.                                                                  |
| 01:36:57   | I mean, we made this show is all about automation.                                                      |
| 01:36:59   | And if you were at home and saying, oh, I would much rather just set it for two hours                   |
| 01:37:04   | so I don't forget to turn it off.                                                                       |
| 01:37:05   | I get that, but I'll tell you, I don't forget to turn it off, you know, it's like because               |
| 01:37:10   | staying on deep focus.                                                                                  |
| 01:37:11   | And the other thing I do with this is I actually automatically set a timer.                             |
| 01:37:15   | So I about every 45 minutes, it's checking in, it's just a timer to go off to say, are                  |
| 01:37:20   | you still doing that?                                                                                   |
| 01:37:21   | You know, did you get distracted?                                                                       |
| 01:37:24   | And so there's, there's, I've got some tricks I play with automation, but in general, I                 |
| 01:37:30   | like turning it on and I like turning it off.                                                           |
| 01:37:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:37:34   | One of the things that I have discovered that is a little bit broken for me in iOS 16.                  |
| 01:37:40   | And I forgot I need to file feedback on this is I actually have a special little shortcut               |
| 01:37:45   | called set focus.                                                                                       |
| 01:37:47   | And all it does is it uses the turn focus mode on option.                                               |
| 01:37:52   | And it got an ask each time in the focus mode and it's got an ask each time in the until                |
| 01:37:59   | because until would usually be turned off time I leave or event ends.                                   |
| 01:38:04   | What I should probably do actually, and I've just realised I should try this is I should                |
| 01:38:09   | have it ask me for the date and the time instead of saying until time because it's almost never         |
| 01:38:17   | until I leave a specific location.                                                                      |
| 01:38:20   | And so if I do that, now it still asks me for the time first before I ask me for the                    |
| 01:38:25   | focus mode, which is the wrong way around.                                                              |
| 01:38:28   | It's asking for the input the wrong way around, but I have that as a shortcut because I find            |
| 01:38:32   | I do forget to exit my focus modes.                                                                     |
| 01:38:34   | This is why my work focus mode comes on at nine, it goes off at five, and my sleep focus                |
| 01:38:39   | mode comes on automatically in the evenings and so on.                                                  |
| 01:38:43   | They are all automated because otherwise I will forget to do it.                                        |
| 01:38:47   | And then I will forget to undo it afterwards.                                                           |
| 01:38:51   | And the forgetting to undo it means Rosa's missing notifications and people are trying                  |
| 01:38:55   | to get a hold of me, you know, World War 17 could be going on outside and I still have                  |
| 01:38:59   | no clue because my notifications are turned off.                                                        |
| 01:39:04   | So I pretty much always when I turn on a focus mode, turn it on for a period of time.                   |
| 01:39:10   | So yeah, I guess I will have to adjust how I've been doing this because it's been driving               |
| 01:39:15   | me ever so slightly nuts that it's asking me for when it's going to end.                                |
| 01:39:22   | And then it asked me which focus mode I want.                                                           |
| 01:39:23   | So I may just give up and put a menu in there and have it use the menu or something to get              |
| 01:39:31   | me to choose my focus mode.                                                                             |
| 01:39:32   | And either way, that's certainly a thing.                                                               |
| 01:39:35   | It would also allow me to slim down because it's rare that I'm going to want to turn on                 |
| 01:39:39   | a, like say my work focus mode for a specific period of time.                                           |
| 01:39:45   | It happens, but it's not standard.                                                                      |
| 01:39:49   | It's not something that I will be doing on a regular basis.                                             |
| 01:39:52   | It's more like I want to turn on my reading focus for a few hours or I do not disturb                   |
| 01:39:56   | on until I go to bed tonight because I've just had too many things in my day.                           |
| 01:40:03   | And so yeah, but that's one of the things I've been doing because the fact that you                     |
| 01:40:06   | can have it turn off at a specific time and you can set that has for me been extremely                  |
| 01:40:12   | useful with setting up the focus modes and actively using them because I don't want to                  |
| 01:40:20   | get so engrossed in what I'm doing that I am distracted from everything else.                           |
| 01:40:23   | And then I forget that there was the other thing that needed to be done afterwards.                     |
| 01:40:27   | Are there any other focus modes that you've got that we haven't discussed about today?                  |
| 01:40:32   | I mean, obviously I've got driving just limits the number of notifications that I get like              |
| 01:40:39   | turns off notifications from certain apps.                                                              |
| 01:40:41   | So I don't hear any blips if my phone's out of silent mode.                                             |
| 01:40:45   | And it changes my home screen as well.                                                                  |
| 01:40:46   | I really wish it could chain like it could or I could put shortcuts on a Carplay screen                 |
| 01:40:54   | of some kind or like, you know, you have favourites in the maps.                                         |
| 01:40:57   | If I could have shortcuts as favourites, which would be, you know, like, hey, I want to drive            |
| 01:41:02   | here and play this playlist, please.                                                                    |
| 01:41:05   | That sort of thing.                                                                                     |
| 01:41:06   | That would be amazing.                                                                                  |
| 01:41:07   | But I guess, I guess we didn't have that yet.                                                           |
| 01:41:10   | And screencasting for me, this is very similar to podcasting.                                           |
| 01:41:13   | It's just got different home screens.                                                                   |
| 01:41:17   | It's got fewer people allowed through.                                                                  |
| 01:41:20   | Just because when I screencast, I, you know, I really don't want people interrupting me.                |
| 01:41:27   | And it has a custom home screen.                                                                        |
| 01:41:29   | So if I am screen recording my phone, then the only thing on my home screen is my dock                  |
| 01:41:34   | and [[Safari]] in the actual home screen, which is quite a useful little thing.                             |
| 01:41:39   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:41:40   | It's a similar one I call production and I intend that to be screencasting or shooting                  |
| 01:41:45   | video.                                                                                                  |
| 01:41:46   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:41:47   | Whereas, you know, podcasting gets its own.                                                             |
| 01:41:49   | And so I'm very, like you're very limiting.                                                             |
| 01:41:51   | You don't want to be screencasting and then have like notifications pop up and things                   |
| 01:41:56   | going on.                                                                                               |
| 01:41:57   | So yeah, production is very limited, but it allows me to let like J.F. does the edits                   |
| 01:42:03   | for a lot of the stuff I do.                                                                            |
| 01:42:04   | And quite often when we're getting towards the end of a field guide, we're communicating                |
| 01:42:08   | a lot.                                                                                                  |
| 01:42:09   | And if he needs to get ahold of me, I want him in, but, you know, it's just him and                     |
| 01:42:14   | my wife and kids at that point.                                                                         |
| 01:42:15   | But that that's the advantage of these focus modes is you can create custom ones.                       |
| 01:42:20   | And my recommendation, anybody listening, use all 10 slots, you know, they're free,                     |
| 01:42:25   | you know, and, yeah, maybe everybody uses all 10 [[Apple]] will add another 10.                             |
| 01:42:30   | That would make me happy.                                                                               |
| 01:42:31   | Yes.                                                                                                    |
| 01:42:32   | Because there was something for a while where if you added focus mode, so to be clear, those            |
| 01:42:37   | two places, you can have focus modes in the settings under the focus.                                   |
| 01:42:40   | And then also, if you go into the control centre, you potentially are able to add them                  |
| 01:42:47   | there.                                                                                                  |
| 01:42:48   | Apparently I have hit the limit.                                                                        |
| 01:42:49   | One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, I do have exactly 10.                         |
| 01:42:53   | I cannot add them anymore in the control centre.                                                        |
| 01:42:57   | But this was something that folks were able to work around previously.                                  |
| 01:43:04   | And so, fingers crossed, this might come back, but, yeah, in the meantime, I guess we'll                |
| 01:43:09   | just have to wait and see what's going to happen there.                                                 |
| 01:43:12   | I do like the idea of the mindfulness focus as a side note.                                             |
| 01:43:16   | That's really like, I like the turquoise that they pop up when they suggest that one.                   |
| 01:43:22   | And then they don't actually like, default your wallpaper to that, which is a bit of                    |
| 01:43:26   | a mistrick, perhaps, but that is right there in the, in the settings at any rate as an                  |
| 01:43:32   | option.                                                                                                 |
| 01:43:33   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:43:34   | Well, we'll have to see what enhancements come.                                                         |
| 01:43:37   | Fingers crossed, there'll be shortcuts control for that action button on the Apple Watch                |
| 01:43:40   | sometime soon.                                                                                          |
| 01:43:42   | And you know, maybe we'll get to see some other things sneaking in there too, like [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]],           |
| 01:43:48   | getting focus mode filter support.                                                                      |
| 01:43:50   | But as it is, I'm feeling like iOS 16 is doing pretty well.                                             |
| 01:43:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:43:54   | I feel like focus modes in particular, if you are interested in automation, even though                 |
| 01:43:58   | I just gave a speech about how I don't automate every bit of it.                                        |
| 01:44:01   | But if you're interested in automation, this is something you should really spend time                  |
| 01:44:06   | with because it is a form of automation and the payback is awesome.                                     |
| 01:44:12   | I mean, you really are able to, you know, to stay focused.                                              |
| 01:44:16   | And that's the challenge.                                                                               |
| 01:44:17   | I mean, I have a whole podcast called focus.                                                            |
| 01:44:19   | So of course this is in my wheelhouse, but I really hope if you're listening to it, you've              |
| 01:44:23   | got this far in the show, take some time, you know, and sit down and try and give some,                 |
| 01:44:30   | mindful thought to what focus modes you need and just what you see them in action.                      |
| 01:44:35   | Like when I'm in deep focus and I end that session and I see that I got like four phone                 |
| 01:44:41   | calls from people that really weren't that important.                                                   |
| 01:44:43   | Yeah.                                                                                                   |
| 01:44:44   | I realised, man, that paid off, right?                                                                  |
| 01:44:46   | You know, or when I'm in, when I wake up in the morning, I go into work mode and I see                  |
| 01:44:52   | an email that would have upset me the night before when I was supposed to be having fun                 |
| 01:44:56   | with my wife and my kids.                                                                               |
| 01:44:58   | If I'd seen it, but now, now I see it when I can deal with it.                                          |
| 01:45:03   | It paid off, you know, and there's just a million little payoffs.                                       |
| 01:45:06   | If you set this stuff up, please go check it out.                                                       |
| 01:45:08   | I know I sound preachy, but this stuff really can make a difference in your life.                       |
| 01:45:14   | It definitely can.                                                                                      |
| 01:45:16   | And it's one of those things where even if you don't use it all that often, you know,                   |
| 01:45:21   | having it there, set up ready or having poked around with it previously can be really handy.            |
| 01:45:26   | You know, like it always happens, right?                                                                |
| 01:45:29   | You end up really ill and there's a crisis on work or something and you just can't deal                 |
| 01:45:33   | with it.                                                                                                |
| 01:45:34   | You know, you've got a migraine or whatever and you just need quiet.                                    |
| 01:45:38   | Having, you know, pre-configured, you do not disturb so that your spouse and so on can                  |
| 01:45:43   | still get through to you if they critically need something, but the rest of the world                   |
| 01:45:46   | just disappears.                                                                                        |
| 01:45:48   | It's so nice to have that as an option and, you know, you may find yourself using it more               |
| 01:45:52   | than you think.                                                                                         |
| 01:45:53   | I really need to set up do not disturb so that whenever I go to the cinema or automatically             |
| 01:45:59   | interest do not disturb.                                                                                |
| 01:46:00   | And you know what I need to do?                                                                         |
| 01:46:01   | I need to borrow my dad's phone and do that as well because he is terrible for forgetting               |
| 01:46:04   | to put his phone in do not disturb at the cinema and my mom always has to nag him about it.             |
| 01:46:09   | So I might just show him that I'm doing that automatically on his phone and that'll be                  |
| 01:46:14   | the end of that discussion.                                                                             |
| 01:46:15   | Well, either way, I'm curious to hear Rose, if you're able to start using the personal                  |
| 01:46:20   | mode, then you'd be like me and using focus modes all day.                                              |
| 01:46:25   | Let us know how that goes.                                                                              |

| 01:46:38   | Are you bumping up against the limit too?                                                               |

| 01:46:41   | I'd like to hear, you know, what choices you've made to deal with that.                                 |

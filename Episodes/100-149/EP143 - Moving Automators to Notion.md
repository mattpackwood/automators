| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the automation podcast where we talk about taking your technology, |
| 00:07      | introducing it to the way you work, and getting it to do all of those things for you.                |
| 00:10      | I am Rosemary Orchard, and joined by my Pella and co-host, David Sparks.                             |
| 00:14      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                             |
| 00:15      | I am great, Rose, looking forward to talking about automation with you today.                        |
| 00:20      | We've got some big project we're doing for the automators that has turned into an episode.           |
| 00:26      | That's always fun.                                                                                   |
| 00:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 00:28      | Yeah, it is.                                                                                         |
| 00:29      | It's one of these things with this show where we do practice what we preach, but sometimes           |
| 00:33      | it's also fun to just lift the curtain a little and show folks what's happening behind the           |
| 00:38      | scenes because we have some pretty awesome automation that helps us build the show.                  |
| 00:42      | Obviously, David and I haven't just given our voices over to AI and given it a topic                 |
| 00:48      | and had it produce stuff for us yet, but we are certainly looking at using automation                |
| 00:55      | to help us with the show, so the planning and the setup and the show notes and things                |
| 01:02      | like that, which is definitely beneficial to both of us so that we don't have to do                  |
| 01:06      | so much legwork on that, and we can just focus on the fun topics.                                    |
| 01:09      | Rosemary Orchard is a well-known host of several popular podcasts.                                   |
| 01:14      | Oh, sorry, that was my robot.                                                                        |
| 01:16      | Have you ever noticed AI always gets facts wrong about people?                                       |
| 01:21      | I was going to do a bit where you were like the host of National Public Radio or something           |
| 01:26      | because it just-                                                                                     |
| 01:27      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:28      | I don't get it.                                                                                      |
| 01:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:30      | I mean, I asked one of the, I can't remember which, but it was at some point about me,               |
| 01:36      | and it told me that I was one of the co-hosts of [[Mac Power Users]].                                    |
| 01:38      | I was really excited by that because I thought [[Stephen Hackett\|Stephen]] had just decided to let me have an            |
| 01:45      | MPU for like a month or so, and the chat GPTO or whatever it was, it got this information            |
| 01:51      | from him, and I asked him, and he was like, nah, nah, sorry, I'm keeping it.                         |
| 01:55      | It's like darn it, but yeah.                                                                         |
| 01:57      | Yeah, it is bad at that kind of stuff, but we have not, it kind of does raise a point                |
| 02:03      | we're just going to talk about briefly is we haven't covered AI much here on the Automated           |
| 02:07      | Podcast, but that is something we will talk about next year because there are uses for               |
| 02:12      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 02:13      | There are things it is good at.                                                                      |
| 02:14      | It's not, even though it's not good at FACTS, I think there are other things you can use             |
| 02:18      | it for as an automator, but we are tracking, we are researching, and we will have stuff              |
| 02:24      | to talk about on that in the future.                                                                 |
| 02:26      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 02:27      | Yeah, we definitely will.                                                                            |
| 02:28      | And I think it's one of these things as well where the most important stuff with all this            |
| 02:32      | is understanding not just that it exists, but how it works.                                          |
| 02:37      | So I have been using chat GPTO for a number of things that work.                                     |
| 02:41      | Like at one point, I was, for reasons, I'm not going to go into the whole backstory,                 |
| 02:45      | but for reasons at one point a couple of weeks ago, I wore a cat in the cat, a cat in the            |
| 02:50      | hat hat to stand up.                                                                                 |
| 02:54      | And somebody said that I needed to deliver my update in rhyme because the cat in the                 |
| 03:00      | hat rhymes.                                                                                          |
| 03:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 03:02      | And so I asked [[ChatGPT]] to help me write a rhyme version of what I was going to say.                 |
| 03:06      | And I had to modify it a bunch because it took out some pretty important words that would            |
| 03:09      | have ruined the meaning that was actually important to what I was trying to deliver.                 |
| 03:13      | But it did help me get it to rhyme.                                                                  |
| 03:15      | So that was pretty cool.                                                                             |
| 03:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 03:17      | So yeah, understanding the limitations of technology that's in front of you is always                |
| 03:21      | very important.                                                                                      |
| 03:22      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 03:23      | And this AI is not going away.                                                                       |
| 03:24      | I feel like it is actually going to get a lot better.                                                |
| 03:27      | And for people trying to be more productive with their technology, there may be an upside            |
| 03:32      | here.                                                                                                |
| 03:33      | But we'll get there.                                                                                 |
| 03:34      | And that's not why we're here today.                                                                 |
| 03:36      | We're here today because of a little app called [[Notion]], which Rose and I, I will, I'm going          |
| 03:41      | to speak for you, Rose.                                                                              |
| 03:42      | I feel like we've both been aware of this app for a long time, but it seems like the                 |
| 03:47      | last six months or so, it has become more prominent in both of our lives.                            |
| 03:51      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 03:52      | I think for me, there were a couple of problems with the idea of using [[Notion]] when a lot of          |
| 03:59      | people first hopped on the [[Notion]] bandwagon.                                                         |
| 04:01      | One of them hasn't been resolved and it's that it doesn't work offline, but for what                 |
| 04:06      | we're going to be using it for, that's not going to be a problem.                                    |
| 04:09      | And the other problem for me was that it was a closed system.                                        |
| 04:12      | Like there was no API to get data in or data out, really.                                            |
| 04:15      | There was an export, but that only works if you're willing to export everything and then             |
| 04:20      | sift through the data.                                                                               |
| 04:23      | And I needed an API with automation options to really be able to take full advantage of              |
| 04:27      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 04:28      | So we got an API and we got some other stuff.                                                        |
| 04:31      | And now it's at the point where you and I, David, have decided that we're moving automators          |
| 04:36      | into [[Notion]] from our previous system.                                                                |
| 04:39      | And it seems to be working pretty well so far.                                                       |
| 04:41      | I'm quite excited by it.                                                                             |
| 04:43      | Yeah, I think [[Notion]] is a tool so long as you understand its limitations can be useful.              |
| 04:50      | It's probably not a solution for everything.                                                         |
| 04:53      | Like in the process of boning up on [[Notion]], I've watched some videos and seen them.                  |
| 04:58      | I've seen some blog posts by folks that like run their whole lives out of [[Notion]].                    |
| 05:03      | And that seems a little weird to me, but we can talk about why, but some of those limitations        |
| 05:09      | you talk about to me make it really not the app.                                                     |
| 05:12      | It's not going to replace [[Obsidian]] or OmniFocus or apps that are kind of more centre focused         |
| 05:18      | and frankly better for that kind of stuff.                                                           |
| 05:21      | But it is useful and especially in the context of collaboration.                                     |
| 05:27      | But maybe before we get into what we're doing with [[Notion]], we should talk about where we             |
| 05:30      | were and why we're leaving.                                                                          |
| 05:33      | Yeah, yeah, because to be clear, it's not that we hate [[Airtable]] and Google Docs now.                 |
| 05:38      | That is not the case.                                                                                |
| 05:40      | We have just decided though we're going to simplify things and use this as an opportunity            |
| 05:45      | to review the workflows and processes involved and see if we can simplify stuff.                     |
| 05:52      | Because one of the things about any system is it grows over time, right?                             |
| 05:57      | And it's kind of like, I'm thinking of like mold and spores and fungus and none of those             |
| 06:04      | have particularly pretty connotations, but essentially what happens with any automation              |
| 06:10      | system or workflow and process, and it doesn't have to be involving automation at all, is            |
| 06:16      | that stuff just grows over time and people are just like, oh, and we also need this thing.           |
| 06:20      | So they just kind of bolt it on at the end or on the side and so on.                                 |
| 06:24      | And you end up with a motorcycle that's got three sidecars attached to it and a trailer.             |
| 06:31      | Because what you actually needed was a car that could seat four people in a trunk or                 |
| 06:37      | maybe like a pickup or something.                                                                    |
| 06:39      | And it's only when you stop and review things that you're like, huh, maybe instead of the            |
| 06:44      | motorbike with three sidecars and a trailer, we should just get a sedan.                             |
| 06:50      | Huh, that's easier.                                                                                  |
| 06:52      | Let's give that a try.                                                                               |
| 06:53      | And so where we started was, well, way back in the day, we were using this service called            |
| 06:59      | Quip, Q-U-I-P, which is a sort of alternative to Google Docs for simultaneous like, you know,        |
| 07:08      | show note writing and so on, so that we could both be in the document at the same time because       |
| 07:11      | that is something that is absolutely critical for us and part of our process, where both             |
| 07:16      | of us have to be able to be in the notes at the same time and making changes and adding              |
| 07:20      | stuff as the show goes on.                                                                           |
| 07:23      | So we can check things off that we've talked about already and add things if something comes         |
| 07:27      | up that we want to talk about as, you know, as we're recording.                                      |
| 07:31      | And so that was a hard requirement.                                                                  |
| 07:33      | We started out with Quip.                                                                            |
| 07:34      | Quip was okay.                                                                                       |
| 07:35      | It was a good idea to experiment with it and even had automation options, but it was not             |
| 07:40      | the best solution.                                                                                   |
| 07:41      | So we then moved from just kind of, we're just going to have like a standard shared                  |
| 07:47      | Mac OS iOS calendar to and Quip to we're going to use Google Docs and [[Airtable]].                      |
| 07:55      | And so we had a really lovely database set up in [[Airtable]] so we'd have, you know, all                |
| 08:00      | the future shows that we were planning, you know, we had a list of guests with who was               |
| 08:04      | like the main contact person for the guests and so on and so forth in there.                         |
| 08:08      | So we could plan everything.                                                                         |
| 08:10      | And then I set up some Zapier and make a formerly known as Integromat automations that when,         |
| 08:18      | for example, when we'd set up a show in [[Airtable]], it would go and create a new Google Doc for        |
| 08:23      | us and put it in the right place and, you know, replace bits of text in it and so on                 |
| 08:27      | and so forth.                                                                                        |
| 08:29      | And this was all working pretty well.                                                                |
| 08:30      | Google Docs is pretty much bulletproof when it comes to multiple people editing at the               |
| 08:33      | same time and so on.                                                                                 |
| 08:35      | But the problem is really like understanding that we needed like these four fields filled            |
| 08:40      | out in [[Airtable]] to, you know, produce the Google Doc and so on.                                      |
| 08:45      | Why can't we just have this in one system when actually [[Notion]] is kind of perfect for                |
| 08:48      | this.                                                                                                |
| 08:49      | You can have a record in [[Notion]] that itself is a document with a whole bunch of text in              |
| 08:53      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 08:54      | And, you know, we were both sort of thinking that there would be ways to improve this system.        |
| 08:59      | And I don't know about you, David, but I heard on [[Cortex]] it may have been more text                  |
| 09:04      | actually about Mike's assistant just putting everything into [[Notion]] and just having it               |
| 09:11      | all in [[Notion]] and Gray's assistant then did the same thing to Gray.                                  |
| 09:15      | And I was like, huh, you know, if these two can put [[Cortex]] into [[Notion]], I feel like we               |
| 09:22      | should try it with automators and see what automation spin we can put on it.                         |
| 09:26      | And so far I'm feeling like we've been pretty successful with this.                                  |
| 09:31      | But obviously, you know, I have a perhaps different perspective because I set up the                 |
| 09:36      | Rube Goldberg machine is not quite the right name for it, but I set up the system of automating      |
| 09:40      | our previous workflow.                                                                               |
| 09:42      | So obviously, you know, you were sort of at my mercy there, David.                                   |
| 09:46      | Well, not entirely, I understood it, but the, but it was a little Rube Goldberg and sometimes        |
| 09:52      | like you push a button on one end and the widget wouldn't come out the other end.                    |
| 09:57      | Well, you know, I do feel like you're right about us building too many sidecars on a motorcycle.     |
| 10:03      | And I think that's a great way to explain it.                                                        |
| 10:06      | So [[Notion]] is something we're interested in, but just before we move on one point, I wanted           |
| 10:12      | emphasises for what we do, you know, making podcasts, you really need contemporaneous text           |
| 10:19      | editing.                                                                                             |
| 10:20      | That's an absolute must.                                                                             |
| 10:22      | You need an application where as Rose was explaining, we can have an outline.                        |
| 10:26      | Every show we make for you is outlined.                                                              |
| 10:28      | And we don't read the outline, but we keep it to keep us on track.                                   |
| 10:31      | And then when we have guests, we have an outline we share with them and being able to go in          |
| 10:36      | and write in there.                                                                                  |
| 10:37      | Okay, we'll move this to the next show or whatever during recording makes the recording              |
| 10:42      | really smooth and, you know, just gives us a way to, to make a better show.                          |
| 10:48      | And when all this started, the only tool to do it was Google Docs.                                   |
| 10:51      | And one of the reasons why we've reconsidered automation is Google no longer is the only             |
| 10:56      | game in town.                                                                                        |
| 10:57      | There's a lot of companies making contemporaneous editable text documents.                           |
| 11:05      | And you know, even Apple Notes, honestly, is pretty good at this point for that kind                 |
| 11:10      | of thing.                                                                                            |
| 11:11      | And, and [[Notion]] is among those.                                                                      |
| 11:13      | It has the ability to create a document or get related to a record, Rose and I are in                |
| 11:18      | it right now.                                                                                        |
| 11:19      | You can see her little face next to the line she's on and she can see my little face next            |
| 11:23      | to the line I'm on.                                                                                  |
| 11:25      | So we absolutely can see our edits and what the other person is doing.                               |
| 11:29      | And so that fundamental requirement is satisfied, but there's a lot of tools that could do that      |
| 11:35      | now.                                                                                                 |
| 11:36      | You know, Google was the first, but they're no longer the only and they're all reliable              |
| 11:41      | and good enough.                                                                                     |
| 11:43      | So then we got thinking, well, what could we do more if we had it all in one place?                  |
| 11:47      | And we are still experimenting with it to be honest with you.                                        |
| 11:51      | But I find it really nice in the sense that we have one database that can be displayed               |
| 11:58      | as a database or a list or a [[Kanban]] board and using different filters.                               |
| 12:05      | And this is a, to a certain extent automation, you're setting up sort criteria and filter            |
| 12:09      | criteria.                                                                                            |
| 12:10      | So you can just go in there at any time and see.                                                     |
| 12:12      | And if like I have an idea for a show, I just put it in the idea [[Kanban]] column and then              |
| 12:19      | Rose sees it too, and we can think about it and if we decide to add it to a show, then               |
| 12:23      | it gets a number and gets kind of into the system.                                                   |
| 12:26      | But it's like one database where things that we used to do in multiple documents are all             |
| 12:30      | in one place.                                                                                        |
| 12:31      | So it allows you to avoid repetition of data entry.                                                  |
| 12:36      | That is an automation tool to a certain extent where it saves you the trouble of having to           |
| 12:41      | re-enter the data.                                                                                   |
| 12:42      | It's also an accuracy tool because you don't make mistakes when you re-enter it, which               |
| 12:47      | is, you know, the two fundamental tenants really of automation.                                      |
| 12:50      | It's faster and it's more accurate.                                                                  |
| 12:52      | So to that extent, it's already working.                                                             |
| 12:55      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 12:57      | And you know, we've done some very simple things like we've added a sort of generic                  |
| 13:01      | outline that we use for every show as a template.                                                    |
| 13:06      | And that, you know, was kind of like the first thing that we needed to do after we'd set             |
| 13:09      | up, you know.                                                                                        |
| 13:10      | We need a couple of fields like who's going to be publishing this episode, what status               |
| 13:15      | is it at, when is it going to be recorded, when is it going to be released, and what                 |
| 13:19      | is the episode number.                                                                               |
| 13:22      | Because, you know, those things, you know, obviously are important information, but then             |
| 13:27      | we needed some other information like, you know, who's going to record which ad and what             |
| 13:34      | topics are we going to talk about and so on and so forth so that we can put all of that              |
| 13:38      | together.                                                                                            |
| 13:39      | And that was just, you know, we had an outline in Google Docs that, you know, was being manipulated  |
| 13:44      | and massaged together by Make.                                                                       |
| 13:49      | And you know, we were able to just take that and modify it a little bit and turn it into             |
| 13:55      | a [[Notion]] template that now whenever we create a new episode idea, it just feels like, you            |
| 14:02      | know, it just pops up in [[Notion]] and ta-da, we have our outline ready to go.                          |
| 14:07      | And that's very, very useful for us.                                                                 |
| 14:09      | Yeah, in fact, that I think is the first official automation we've done in [[Notion]] is you have        |
| 14:16      | templated document abilities.                                                                        |
| 14:18      | So currently we have one for a standard show.                                                        |
| 14:23      | We're going to be in, I'm kind of in the process of outlining outlines for a focus show, like        |
| 14:29      | where we focus on one automation tool, one or Q&A show, we want to do more of those in               |
| 14:34      | the future.                                                                                          |
| 14:35      | We're getting a lot of questions.                                                                    |
| 14:36      | We need to do more shows where we answer those questions, guest shows, you know, application         |
| 14:42      | focus shows.                                                                                         |
| 14:43      | We could come up with several templates where the kinds of things we cover in those shows            |
| 14:47      | are just automatically populated into the show outline for us.                                       |
| 14:51      | And that's kind of what we're doing with Make, but a little different.                               |
| 14:56      | But I do think one of the things that surprised me about [[Notion]] as we got started with it            |
| 15:00      | is that [[Notion]] has a significant amount of automation built right into the application.              |
| 15:07      | I mean, there are ways to automate it from outside, but for a lot of people that get                 |
| 15:12      | into [[Notion]], I think you're going to find that the inside automation is going to get                 |
| 15:18      | you a long way.                                                                                      |
| 15:19      | Yeah, and I think that that is something that is definitely worth considering whenever               |
| 15:23      | you're evaluating a new automation tool, you know, not just how much can it be automated,            |
| 15:28      | but more automation or just basic features that are part of this will make your life                 |
| 15:35      | easier that it bakes right into it.                                                                  |
| 15:38      | So you know, the fact that we have templates, we have the ability to have a [[Kanban]] view              |
| 15:42      | and two calendar views, one for when we're recording and one for when we're releasing                |
| 15:47      | and things like that, that makes this a really good choice for us.                                   |
| 15:50      | You know, we were using [[Airtable]], we could have the [[Kanban]] view and the calendar views               |
| 15:55      | and the different table views in [[Airtable]], and we did, but the fact that we have that                |
| 16:00      | and the show notes in [[Notion]] definitely puts [[Notion]], you know, a little bit up there.                |
| 16:05      | It's also very simple to use, so you know, when we've got guests on the show and so on,              |
| 16:09      | we can send them a link to a [[Notion]] file or the [[Notion]] document for the show and just                |
| 16:15      | say, here you go, and you know, it may not necessarily be something that they've definitely          |
| 16:21      | seen before, but let's face it, most of our guests have probably at least looked at a                |
| 16:25      | [[Notion]] document once in their life.                                                                  |
| 16:28      | And you know, being completely, brutally honest about it, they can't figure out how                  |
| 16:32      | to do a [[Notion]] document, they're probably not going to be a great guest for us.                      |
| 16:36      | So you know, I think that's, you know, we're not going to have a problem with that.                  |
| 16:40      | Yeah, yeah, when I don't think we're going to have a problem with that, you know, we                 |
| 16:44      | certainly did have the old problem with Quip where people were going, and we sent them               |
| 16:48      | like a public link that shouldn't have required them to sign up and they ended up having to          |
| 16:51      | like create accounts and we had to grant them access to stuff and all sorts of weirdness.            |
| 16:55      | So that was definitely not great.                                                                    |
| 16:56      | And you know, obviously Google Docs, pretty much everybody's run into Google Docs before,            |
| 16:59      | but [[Notion]] is just as simple to use and it's got all the information in there for us, which          |
| 17:06      | definitely makes it a lot easier.                                                                    |
| 17:08      | Yeah, so, but just to kind of get on the automation thread, templates are a great way to automate    |
| 17:14      | in [[Notion]] and you can template not just what you want the document to say, but like one              |
| 17:20      | of the things I was thinking about doing ultimately, I didn't do it, but I did some tests with       |
| 17:25      | it is I have a task list related to each podcast episode.                                            |
| 17:30      | And you know, I've got ways to script that an OmniFocus or or or [[Obsidian]] or wherever                |
| 17:34      | you want to put or [[Apple Reminders]], there's a lot of ways you can do that.                           |
| 17:38      | But like for every show, I need to work on the outline, I need to get the ads recorded.              |
| 17:42      | If it's mine to publish, I need to get a published.                                                  |
| 17:44      | So I have a generated task list per show.                                                            |
| 17:48      | And I really thought about just dropping that into the template, you know, because you could         |
| 17:52      | do that.                                                                                             |
| 17:53      | You could put checkboxes in here and say, did the ads get recorded?                                  |
| 17:57      | Did the show get uploaded, etc.                                                                      |
| 18:00      | But I don't like the idea of going to another place for tasks and [[Notion]] really is a collaborative   |
| 18:05      | tool for me.                                                                                         |
| 18:06      | It's not my task manager.                                                                            |
| 18:08      | So so I ultimately didn't do that.                                                                   |
| 18:10      | But that's the kind of stuff you can do with built-in [[Notion]] automation.                             |
| 18:14      | If you've got a team task list, I think it's a great way to go about doing it because it             |
| 18:18      | just shows up there.                                                                                 |
| 18:20      | Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.                                                                           |
| 18:22      | And I think with all of these things, you know, you have to be very careful about not                |
| 18:26      | adding too many different systems that work differently.                                             |
| 18:30      | You know, I have my task list and OmniFocus and that is my source of truth for my tasks.             |
| 18:34      | If I start having to check OmniFocus and [[Notion]], then there's a possibility I'm just not going       |
| 18:40      | to see something because I'm going to forget to open [[Notion]] today and I'm not going to               |
| 18:44      | see that you've added a task that I needed to do, whereas if you just sent me a message              |
| 18:48      | and I'd add it to OmniFocus, it would be in the system and it would get done.                        |
| 18:52      | So we definitely, you know, had to be aware of both how we work and how the other person             |
| 18:58      | also prefers to work as part of this.                                                                |
| 19:01      | But I think that's also just good automation practice, knowing how you work and understanding        |
| 19:06      | that even though you have aspirations to do things differently, that wouldn't happen                 |
| 19:10      | overnight is definitely part of this.                                                                |
| 19:13      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 19:14      | And I guess we should just mention since you said OmniFocus, that OmniFocus version 4 came           |
| 19:20      | out yesterday.                                                                                       |
| 19:22      | So yeah, it's a thing though.                                                                        |
| 19:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 19:25      | Yeah, we're going to have to do a whole episode on OmniFocus 4 and all of those things soon,         |
| 19:30      | David.                                                                                               |
| 19:31      | I think, I think that's going to be an early next year one.                                          |
| 19:33      | We always like talking about task managers and stuff in the new year anyway, it's a good             |
| 19:37      | time of year to be doing it when people are looking at new systems and themes and resolutions        |
| 19:41      | and so on.                                                                                           |
| 19:42      | So yeah, we'll save that as an episode for next year, but depending on that one.                     |
| 19:50      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                          |
| 19:52      | If you're looking for something new to watch during a holiday downtime, this is for you.             |
| 19:57      | Maybe you've already watched Home Alone too many times this year.                                    |
| 20:00      | Maybe you just want to change from the usual movies.                                                 |
| 20:02      | ExpressVPN is an ad that lets you change your online location.                                       |
| 20:06      | And if you use Netflix, that means you get a whole new library of content.                           |
| 20:10      | Because if you didn't know, Netflix has different shows and movies in every country.                 |
| 20:14      | So for example, I can come back and watch Rick and Morty on Australian Netflix, which                |
| 20:18      | is great because I can watch it's always sunny in Philadelphia on UK Netflix, but you                |
| 20:23      | know, sometimes you just want to watch something else.                                               |
| 20:25      | Or maybe you're traveling and you want to continue watching that show you were watching              |
| 20:28      | at home, but Netflix isn't showing it to you anymore.                                                |
| 20:32      | It's so simple to do.                                                                                |
| 20:33      | Just fire up the ExpressVPN app on my computer or my TV, change the location, refresh Netflix        |
| 20:39      | and that's it.                                                                                       |
| 20:40      | ExpressVPN lets you choose from almost 100 different countries.                                      |
| 20:43      | So just imagine all those Netflix libraries you can go through.                                      |
| 20:46      | But it's not just Netflix.                                                                           |
| 20:48      | ExpressVPN helps you access more content on all the streaming services.                              |
| 20:51      | Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer, YouTube, you name it.                                                      |
| 20:55      | In general, VPNs can be super slow.                                                                  |
| 20:57      | But the reason why so many people love ExpressVPN is it's so fast.                                   |
| 21:00      | There's never any buffering or lag and all your shows stream in HD quality.                          |
| 21:05      | So this holiday season, give yourself a brand new library of content.                                |
| 21:09      | Go to expressvpn.com/automators right now and you can get an extra three months                |
| 21:15      | of ExpressVPN for free.                                                                              |
| 21:17      | That's expressvpn.com/automators, expressvpn.com/automators to learn more.               |
| 21:27      | Okay, Rose, in addition to the template automation, recently [[Notion]] came out with an update.         |
| 21:35      | That went more in depth with database automations where creating records can kick off automations.   |
| 21:41      | So have you played with this at all?                                                                 |
| 21:45      | So I have looked into this.                                                                          |
| 21:46      | I've played with this in like a couple of test areas, but I haven't actually done anything           |
| 21:51      | in the automators.                                                                                   |
| 21:55      | I forgot the word for this.                                                                          |
| 21:56      | Is it a team?                                                                                        |
| 21:57      | Is that what we have here?                                                                           |
| 21:58      | It's a team space.                                                                                   |
| 22:00      | Sure.                                                                                                |
| 22:01      | Yeah, I think.                                                                                       |
| 22:04      | I'm not great at the [[Notion]] terminology.                                                             |
| 22:06      | I should probably double check that before the show, but I was busy actually using [[Notion]].           |
| 22:11      | So yeah, apologies, folks, but yeah, I played with it in my own personal area, but I haven't         |
| 22:17      | done anything yet in the automators podcast I shared stuff, but I'm definitely intrigued             |
| 22:23      | and interested in doing this.                                                                        |
| 22:24      | How about you?                                                                                       |
| 22:25      | Because I know you've been using [[Notion]] in a few other areas.                                        |
| 22:27      | Yeah, I mean, and I guess I should have said that earlier.                                           |
| 22:31      | So [[Notion]], we moved the MacSparky stuff into [[Notion]].                                                |
| 22:35      | It's a very small team, primarily two people, myself included, but sometimes a third or              |
| 22:41      | a fourth show up for one bit or another.                                                             |
| 22:44      | But I just wanted a place where if I updated something that everybody else knew about it             |
| 22:49      | and, and historically I did a lot of this project management stuff in [[Obsidian]], I still              |
| 22:53      | do my personal stuff there, but I don't, they don't see that.                                        |
| 22:58      | So I needed a place where we could have collaborative truth.                                         |
| 23:01      | And then, then it, then it multiplied like tribbles that went to the Mac power users                 |
| 23:06      | and the automators and the focus podcasts.                                                           |
| 23:08      | And I've got a couple of other personal projects.                                                    |
| 23:10      | So I've got several spaces I participate in, which makes it more likely that I'll check              |
| 23:15      | it every day and that's good.                                                                        |
| 23:18      | But getting back to these triggers.                                                                  |
| 23:19      | So what they've done is they've added automation triggers based on primarily two conditions.         |
| 23:25      | One is if you add a new page, you can trigger an automation, or if you edit a property,              |
| 23:31      | you can trigger an automation in properties in [[Notion]] or just what that sounds like.                 |
| 23:35      | It's a thing like you could say the status of a project or the type of a project or the              |
| 23:40      | person responsible.                                                                                  |
| 23:42      | And those two triggers give you a lot of juice if you want to start automating things.               |
| 23:48      | Like if you wanted to say, if the status changes to active, assign a task to Joe, right?             |
| 23:54      | You know, and then Joe has to check on the active project or ready to publish, assign                |
| 23:59      | it to Mary and then Mary can go and publish it.                                                      |
| 24:02      | So you've got kind of stuff like that.                                                               |
| 24:04      | You can do, you can have it, the triggers, like I said, the triggers are page added or               |
| 24:10      | or property edited, but the actual actions, there's, there's quite extensive.                        |
| 24:14      | You can add a new page, you can edit a page, you can send a [[Slack]] notification and a lot             |
| 24:19      | of people in [[Notion]] pair it with [[Slack]] because [[Notion]], I don't think is great at contemporary        |
| 24:24      | news, like Tix communication, like [[Slack]] is, and you can, you can even have it just edit             |
| 24:31      | another property.                                                                                    |
| 24:32      | So there's, there's a lot of ways you can kind of slice it up, but those two triggers                |
| 24:37      | are two of the most common things you do.                                                            |
| 24:39      | So then you can start adding automation on that basis.                                               |
| 24:42      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 24:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 24:44      | So for us, you know, if, if we were going to experiment things like, you know, the,                  |
| 24:48      | when, you know, this status is updated, you know, which is a field, it's a property, then,           |
| 24:54      | you know, assign it to this person, you know, we could do that if we say that Joe's recorded,        |
| 24:58      | we could assign it to our editor Jim to do the editing, but Jim has his own system where             |
| 25:05      | he works and he does not want or need to be dragged into the whole [[Notion]] nation of everything       |
| 25:11      | that we're doing here as well.                                                                       |
| 25:13      | And so our system for that is very simple.                                                           |
| 25:15      | You make sure all the files are there and then Jim, you know, gets to it when his regularly          |
| 25:20      | set schedule comes around and says, Hey, you need to go and edit the automators podcast.             |
| 25:24      | And he opens the automators folder and goes, Oh, look, all the files are here.                       |
| 25:27      | Yay.                                                                                                 |
| 25:28      | Well done, Bruceman and David.                                                                       |
| 25:29      | Or at least that's what, what I hope he says.                                                        |
| 25:32      | And the problem with that has never been that Jim didn't do the work.                                |
| 25:36      | It's usually that one of us didn't get the file up.                                                  |
| 25:38      | So we don't need to worry about in like finding a way for Jim to like have to spend time on          |
| 25:43      | this.                                                                                                |
| 25:44      | But it is even like with an existing team.                                                           |
| 25:48      | This stuff can be of use.                                                                            |
| 25:50      | I think it really is particularly useful if you use [[Notion]] databases for task management             |
| 25:56      | and that's not something we're actually doing.                                                       |
| 25:59      | Like when I talked earlier about saying you could drop tasks into a record, that's just              |
| 26:03      | a checklist.                                                                                         |
| 26:04      | They call it to do in [[Notion]] and the way you trigger is you hit slash to do and it creates           |
| 26:09      | a little box.                                                                                        |
| 26:10      | But, but there is another way to go about this is set up a database of tasks and then                |
| 26:16      | each task has multiple properties and that can work well.                                            |
| 26:20      | There's a lot of people that use it that way.                                                        |
| 26:23      | To me, it's a bridge too far for making a podcast.                                                   |
| 26:25      | We don't need that.                                                                                  |
| 26:26      | And I don't want to add extra complexity.                                                            |
| 26:29      | But if you're doing something like that, then these automations could really, I think,               |
| 26:34      | come in handy.                                                                                       |
| 26:35      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 26:36      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 26:37      | I think a big chunk of this is understanding what do we need here?                                   |
| 26:41      | So our recording date field, for example, that has a time property on it because knowing             |
| 26:46      | what time we're recording as well as the date we're recording, that's super important.               |
| 26:50      | But the release date, we're a bit fuzzy about the times that we exactly release at because           |
| 26:56      | it depends on a number of things, which are just us.                                                 |
| 27:00      | It depends on relay schedule and a whole bunch of other things as well.                              |
| 27:04      | So we don't have a time on that.                                                                     |
| 27:05      | We have the day.                                                                                     |
| 27:06      | We know what day it's supposed to be released.                                                       |
| 27:09      | And we have a guest property, but the guest property is not something that we have to                |
| 27:13      | fill out because just like this episode, not every episode has a guest.                              |
| 27:18      | But we do have a section for our Automated Max topic where we can select from a whole                |
| 27:23      | bunch of ideas that we've collected what we're going to talk about on Automated Max and so           |
| 27:28      | on and so forth.                                                                                     |
| 27:29      | And I feel like that's the sort of thing where we have to understand our own system and our          |
| 27:35      | own workflows and processes before we can really just dive in and set everything up.                 |
| 27:42      | Because as with all of these things, if the requirements are not properly understood,                |
| 27:46      | you can set up the most beautiful thing in the world and somebody's just going to come               |
| 27:50      | in and stick duct tape all over it and sticky tack and all that stuff and it's going to              |
| 27:55      | make it look really ugly because it didn't actually work.                                            |
| 27:59      | And we have to have a system that actually works because we don't have a system that                 |
| 28:02      | actually works.                                                                                      |
| 28:03      | And guess what, we're not going to have a show and that's not something we're happy                  |
| 28:06      | to do.                                                                                               |
| 28:07      | So we have to get this right.                                                                        |
| 28:08      | Well, and one of the nice things about this new system is that you can reference other               |
| 28:14      | database documents inside the database.                                                              |
| 28:16      | So like you mentioned Automated Max, we created a separate database of Automated Max ideas           |
| 28:23      | and we can put notes in there and they're not tied to an episode.                                    |
| 28:27      | With our old system, they were tied to the particular Google Doc and now we can be more              |
| 28:32      | fluid with it and say, well, today let's talk about a Christmas playlist, for example,               |
| 28:37      | which is what we're going to talk about today in Automated Max.                                      |
| 28:40      | And we've already got a document with all our notes to it.                                           |
| 28:42      | We can just incorporate it into the existing outline and go from there.                              |
| 28:45      | So that is definitely more efficient and a little more automator friendly as well.                   |
| 28:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 28:51      | Yeah, especially because it means that we can have a whole bunch of ideas and you know               |
| 28:54      | what David and I do, we'll sit down and just have like a sort of general chit chat planning          |
| 28:59      | session where we'll try and come up with a whole bunch of ideas and the fact that we                 |
| 29:02      | can have ideas for shows, ideas for Max topics and so on, we can just dump them down.                |
| 29:06      | We don't have to relate them to each other right now.                                                |
| 29:08      | And even if we do decide to link this thing to that thing at some point, then we can unlink          |
| 29:14      | it right until we've recorded the episode of Automators and change it to something else.             |
| 29:21      | So you know, I had a really great idea that I wanted to talk about in the last episode               |
| 29:25      | and then I was like, hang on a minute.                                                               |
| 29:27      | This is a really great Automators Max topic, but it's not an Automators Max topic that               |
| 29:31      | I feel like we should talk about today because we were talking about Christmas automations           |
| 29:36      | and David's just been getting excited about 3D printers.                                             |
| 29:38      | So we talked about 3D printing Christmas stuff.                                                      |
| 29:41      | And I've saved that Max topic for a future episode with all the notes and it took two                |
| 29:47      | clicks to change.                                                                                    |
| 29:50      | And that's the mark of a great system that's going to be good for us to use because if               |
| 29:55      | we don't have to automate it because the system just works, that's even better.                      |
| 30:00      | But by just being able to think a little bit more generically is not the right word.                 |
| 30:06      | But being able to think in a manner where we can identify unique components and split                |
| 30:12      | them up in a way that they can be put back together, it's like Lego, right?                          |
| 30:16      | That's how we build the show.                                                                        |
| 30:17      | We take Lego pieces and we figure out what it is that we're going to build and how we're             |
| 30:21      | going to build it.                                                                                   |
| 30:22      | And then we actually build it.                                                                       |
| 30:24      | But while we're figuring out what it is and how we're going to build it, we don't necessarily        |
| 30:27      | know which bricks we need.                                                                           |
| 30:28      | Yeah, agreed.                                                                                        |
| 30:31      | And that's exactly what we're trying to do here.                                                     |
| 30:35      | One thing I would like to, I'd like to kind of continue on the internal automation though            |
| 30:40      | in [[Notion]] for a bit.                                                                                 |
| 30:42      | So we've talked about the template-based and then the more active trigger-based automations.         |
| 30:47      | And I would say the third leg of this built into [[Notion]] is, [[Notion]] has its own AI engine             |
| 30:54      | and I did some research on it over the weekend as we prepped for the show.                           |
| 30:58      | I think it is a licensed version of [[ChatGPT]] at some level.                                          |
| 31:04      | And I don't know the details and you need to buy like a year of it.                                  |
| 31:11      | So I have limited experience so that you do get some free AI inquiries.                              |
| 31:17      | And I think, as I said earlier, we're going to talk about AI more next year.                         |
| 31:19      | I'm still kind of getting my arms around what I could do with AI in [[Notion]].                          |
| 31:23      | I can tell you having a [[ChatGPT]] account, I feel like that's a stronger engine and ability           |
| 31:30      | to do it because I can [[ChatGPT]] and can have it make me pictures and do all sorts of stuff.          |
| 31:35      | I think a lot of that is in [[Notion]], but not all of it.                                               |
| 31:37      | But the advantage I see in [[Notion]] is if you're in with [[Notion]], you're using it.                      |
| 31:42      | Like you can have it say, you know, outline an employee onboarding process and it's going            |
| 31:47      | to use [[Notion]] syntax and organisation to put that together and it's going to just fit right          |
| 31:55      | in your [[Notion]] database.                                                                             |
| 31:56      | You're not going to have to do any massageing of data.                                                |
| 31:59      | It just generates it for you right there.                                                            |
| 32:01      | But you know, every app these days has an AI component to it.                                        |
| 32:05      | You know, I don't know.                                                                              |
| 32:07      | I'm just waiting for the FART app with AI built in because it seems like that's going                |
| 32:12      | to happen.                                                                                           |
| 32:13      | It looks like everything has AI built in and at least at work, AI is built into a whole              |
| 32:18      | bunch of stuff.                                                                                      |
| 32:19      | And then of course, it had to be immediately turned off because yeah, there's no way we're           |
| 32:22      | just feeding all of our code into that.                                                              |
| 32:25      | Yes, right.                                                                                          |
| 32:26      | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 32:27      | The thing people forget is that the AI is not on your device.                                        |
| 32:30      | It's somewhere else.                                                                                 |
| 32:31      | And in order for it to do its thing, it needs to know what you're writing.                           |
| 32:35      | But I do feel like that [[Notion]] would be a good candidate for AI if it's done right.                  |
| 32:41      | And they've got a component.                                                                         |
| 32:42      | They've been doing it for a year.                                                                    |
| 32:44      | The most recent thing they've done is that you can ask it a question and it'll try and               |
| 32:50      | find an answer based on your own [[Notion]] database.                                                    |
| 32:54      | So rather than go out to the internet and look for it, it will look at your database.                |
| 32:58      | So if you've got a big extensive database, let's say like your company and you put all               |
| 33:03      | your employee policies and procedures in there and let's say that's a 50,000 word document,          |
| 33:09      | you can ask it a question and it will go into that document and find the answer for you.             |
| 33:14      | And that is in beta right now.                                                                       |
| 33:16      | But if you have a paid AI account, I think you might already have access to it.                      |
| 33:21      | So that's the kind of internal automation they're doing.                                             |
| 33:24      | I mean, they're clearly invested in it.                                                              |
| 33:26      | And a year from now, I think there's going to be even more of it.                                    |
| 33:30      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 33:31      | And I think that that is the magic of this, where you're feeding it the right data yourself          |
| 33:38      | to start with and you get the right answers, then that's perfect.                                    |
| 33:44      | And it's one of those things where, as with all of these things, you've got to have like             |
| 33:48      | the right data and the right structure and so on in place in the first place.                        |
| 33:52      | And that's one of the reasons why we are not just copy pasting everything that we had.               |
| 33:58      | I mean, we did start by copy pasting a bunch of stuff from our Google Docs into [[Notion]],              |
| 34:03      | but we're not just leaving it at that.                                                               |
| 34:05      | Using this as an opportunity to review how we do things and why we do things the way                 |
| 34:09      | that we do them so that we can make sure that things are set up in a way that will make              |
| 34:14      | more sense for us.                                                                                   |
| 34:16      | So one of the things that we should definitely look at is when we change the type of podcast         |
| 34:22      | episode that we're recording, that it can add some other information to the document                 |
| 34:29      | for us.                                                                                              |
| 34:30      | But what we don't want it to do is just replace the document that's there with something else        |
| 34:33      | because we've already written a bunch of notes into it, then we're going to lose all of that.        |
| 34:38      | And so we have to figure out exactly what it is we're going to do with this automation               |
| 34:42      | to make sure that it works in a way that is intuitive to us and friendly, but also makes             |
| 34:50      | our lives easier.                                                                                    |
| 34:52      | Now let's talk about automation notion from outside of notion because it is a cloud-based            |
| 34:57      | database and you can do quite a bit with these third-party cloud automation services.                |
| 35:03      | They have an API and most things can plug into it.                                                   |
| 35:08      | Just the other day, as an experiment, I connected it to my Trello account.                           |
| 35:13      | I like Trello.                                                                                       |
| 35:15      | I don't use it for everything, but I use it on some things and having that common on-board           |
| 35:20      | view through Trello, you can also just plug it straight into notion.                                 |
| 35:24      | But if you go through their connected app list, there is a lot of options in there for automation    |
| 35:30      | tools.                                                                                               |
| 35:31      | Yeah, there really are.                                                                              |
| 35:32      | I mean, I'm obviously slightly biased because one of the companies that I founded, [[Snailed It]]           |
| 35:38      | development, has taken over [[Alex Hay\|Alex Hay's]] apps after his sad passing.                               |
| 35:42      | So that means that we are now the proud keepers, grounds keepers.                                    |
| 35:47      | I don't know what the right word is, but we're looking after Nautomate.                              |
| 35:50      | So obviously, I started using Nautomate for a whole bunch of stuff.                                  |
| 35:54      | And the first thing that I created were two shortcuts, two very simple shortcuts, which              |
| 35:59      | is one, add automators, mechs, topic, idea.                                                          |
| 36:03      | And number two, add automators, podcast, topic, idea.                                                |
| 36:07      | And so I have two little shortcuts that I have access to so that I can just add an idea              |
| 36:13      | of automators or automators, mechs to those databases.                                               |
| 36:17      | And I can optionally add more information.                                                           |
| 36:20      | And I then went a little bit further, David, because you know me, I'm the gold star kind             |
| 36:25      | of girl.                                                                                             |
| 36:26      | I'm not going to do the basic version.                                                               |
| 36:28      | And so if I type multiple lines into the ideas section to start with, it'll split it and go          |
| 36:34      | through each one and add each one as an idea.                                                        |
| 36:36      | So it's not just going to do like one, it's not just going to add one database entry with            |
| 36:40      | like four ideas in the title, it's going to add four separate ideas into that.                       |
| 36:47      | And yeah, I'm quite proud of that.                                                                   |
| 36:48      | It was very simple to create the shortcut.                                                           |
| 36:53      | Alex did a fabulous job on that.                                                                     |
| 36:55      | But yeah, that's the sort of thing that I like having because if I have an idea when                 |
| 37:03      | I am offline, for example, I can just write stuff into [[Drafts]] and then I can copy it over            |
| 37:07      | and just use shortcuts to add it later when I do have internet, which turned out to be               |
| 37:12      | very helpful recently because I was on a train and got stuck in a tunnel for like an hour            |
| 37:16      | and a half.                                                                                          |
| 37:17      | So having a system where I know, okay, this is what I'm going to do.                                 |
| 37:20      | And then I was able to create a [[Drafts]] action.                                                       |
| 37:23      | Yep, though, it just takes the content of the [[Drafts]] and shifts into the shortcut.                   |
| 37:27      | But that's all I needed to do because [[Drafts]] has full shortcut support and shortcuts then            |
| 37:32      | has notion support.                                                                                  |
| 37:33      | Of course, [[Drafts]] also has notion support through its API.                                           |
| 37:37      | And that's definitely something I need to look into a lot more.                                      |
| 37:40      | But that's just, you know, some of the basic stuff that's, you know, we're all probably              |
| 37:44      | already using or at least vaguely familiar with that has notion support bill right in.               |
| 37:49      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 37:50      | So let's talk about that a bit.                                                                      |
| 37:51      | First of all, not to me, as I understand it works on Mac iPhone iPad, right?                         |
| 37:55      | It's not just the iPhone.                                                                            |
| 37:57      | So it allows you to create shortcuts that can manipulate an existing database in [[Notion]].             |
| 38:04      | So you don't have to go into the app or to the website, you can just write a shortcut.               |
| 38:09      | And the beauty of that is not only the quick way you can add stuff to [[Notion]], but it's               |
| 38:14      | also the way you can use one set of data collection in a shortcut and put it in multiple locations.  |
| 38:21      | Let's say you wanted to do a new project where you wanted to create a project database record        |
| 38:27      | of [[Notion]], you wanted to set a meeting on the calendar and you want to send an email                 |
| 38:32      | to all the key participants, right?                                                                  |
| 38:35      | Rather than do that three times, you would just write a shortcut that collected the necessary        |
| 38:39      | data and then distributed that data to those three locations.                                        |
| 38:43      | It took the, you know, the event time and date and name creates event.                               |
| 38:47      | It takes the project name and puts the [[Notion]] database record in and it, you know, it has            |
| 38:53      | a template that's in the email to the key players and uses the same stuff.                           |
| 38:57      | Here's the event time and date and the record.                                                       |
| 39:00      | And that's the beauty of shortcuts really in a lot of ways is it allows you to automate              |
| 39:04      | multiple apps and data sources at once, but that was always not really a thing for [[Notion]],           |
| 39:10      | right?                                                                                               |
| 39:11      | [[Notion]] doesn't have shortcut support.                                                                |
| 39:13      | So Alex and now Rosemary has built a system into that.                                               |
| 39:18      | So to begin with, what's involved for someone listening to connect Nautomate, I don't know            |
| 39:24      | if I'm saying it right, but I like it, Nautomate to [[Notion]].                                           |
| 39:27      | I mean, so you have to connect it so when you run the shortcut, it knows what database               |
| 39:32      | to put them in.                                                                                      |
| 39:33      | Well, so to start with the first thing you do when you, if you download Nautomate is                  |
| 39:39      | it will prompt you and walk you through connecting your [[Notion]] account with Nautomate so that it      |
| 39:45      | actually can talk to [[Notion]] and not just [[Notion]] generically as a whole, but your [[Notion]].             |
| 39:51      | And then from there, you have a number of various different actions and they're all                  |
| 39:57      | documented in the app, I should note.                                                                |
| 40:00      | And the first thing that you will probably want to do is to use find databases or similar            |
| 40:06      | to find your database, if you're looking at, you know, potentially having multiple different         |
| 40:10      | databases that you may want to add this into, you know, if I'm, if for example, I wanted             |
| 40:16      | to have the option to add something to either the automators topic database or the automators        |
| 40:24      | max topic database or the guest topic database, I could use find database, but also in the           |
| 40:30      | shortcut section, I can just select a specific database if I, if I, if I know exactly which          |
| 40:35      | one it's going to go into.                                                                           |
| 40:38      | And then from there, you know, it will, they can read out the properties and so on and               |
| 40:41      | help you figure out how to add everything that you want or need to add.                              |
| 40:46      | And it's very, very clever the way Alex has done this, because the problem with [[Notion]]               |
| 40:52      | is it's not just there is a database entry, it has a title, it has a note, it has a date             |
| 41:00      | field, it has a comment field, no, no, no, like it can have any, you know, it can have               |
| 41:05      | any number of any kind of fields.                                                                    |
| 41:08      | So exactly what it is you're going to have to fill in is going to depend on which database           |
| 41:12      | you're talking to and how it's set up.                                                               |
| 41:16      | And that's one of the reasons why I decided that I was going to create separate shortcuts            |
| 41:21      | rather than just one shortcut to add different kinds of ideas for automators so that I can           |
| 41:28      | just, you know, have it probably for a couple of different things if I'm adding an actual            |
| 41:32      | automators episode idea versus an automators max, automators max topic idea.                         |
| 41:39      | But you've got the option to, you know, use the action forget details of your database               |
| 41:43      | so that you can get the title of your database, what page it's on, and more.                         |
| 41:48      | And yeah, and you can, you know, just add an entry to your database and it sounds very               |
| 41:53      | simple when I say that, but there's a values field that will accept, you know, an array              |
| 41:58      | or dictionaries and, you know, and help you sort everything out and there's tutorials                |
| 42:03      | built into the app just to be clear so you can tap on anything and, okay, add entry to               |
| 42:08      | database and you start reading through and you're, they're going, there's the word values,           |
| 42:13      | there's array, there's dictionaries, JSON formatted, oh my God, I'm confused, scroll                 |
| 42:17      | down a little bit if that happens to you or even if it doesn't, okay, and there's add                |
| 42:21      | entry to database as a tutorial, that's also in the tutorial section.                                |
| 42:26      | And then there's also a couple of example shortcuts at the bottom that you can just                  |
| 42:30      | have a play with and see how they work to figure all of that out.                                    |
| 42:35      | And, you know, when I first started using this, I read through all the tutorials and                 |
| 42:39      | so on, partially just checking to make sure that I actually knew what tutorials we had               |
| 42:43      | and so on and so on, but yeah, you can figure out what kind of blocks you want to add and            |
| 42:50      | all sorts of things when you go through adding all of this.                                          |
| 42:53      | So it's very simple to work with once, once you have your database set up, if you don't              |
| 43:00      | have a database set up, you may have to use the create database notion, notemate action              |
| 43:04      | instead, but I'm sure you'll figure that out.                                                        |
| 43:08      | Yeah, I'll say, because I've been testing out different sources and I knew this episode              |
| 43:13      | was coming, I wanted to see what's out there, like using it with a cloud-based automation            |
| 43:18      | system can work, but the notemate, I think, is much more, much superior because you don't            |
| 43:23      | have to send the data to a third party that then sends it to a third party.                          |
| 43:27      | You've got a direct connection, you know, your API basically linked to your database                 |
| 43:32      | and it happens immediately and there's, you know, to pay for an extra service or anything,           |
| 43:37      | it just happens.                                                                                     |
| 43:38      | And I, I mean, there's a remarkable list of actions related to notion in here.                       |
| 43:44      | But I just, the only one I find myself using is add record to database because that's the            |
| 43:50      | one, right?                                                                                          |
| 43:51      | You've, you've got whatever it is you're working on, you've probably already set it up in notion,    |
| 43:56      | but you want to add records to it on the fly and being able to do it like Rose talked                |
| 44:01      | about with [[Drafts]] and a shortcut section.                                                            |
| 44:03      | And like I talked about the news, the data you put in for the notion record and use it               |
| 44:07      | for something else too, that's, that's golden, right?                                                |
| 44:11      | And then you just got everything together.                                                           |
| 44:12      | Like I was talking earlier how I do a lot of project management type stuff in [[Obsidian]].              |
| 44:18      | I like to have my project records there as local.                                                    |
| 44:22      | It always works.                                                                                     |
| 44:23      | There were just text files.                                                                          |
| 44:24      | I can work in them anytime on any device.                                                            |
| 44:27      | But I didn't like the idea of having to go into notion and create a record for a show,               |
| 44:33      | but also create a record for a show in [[Obsidian]].                                                     |
| 44:37      | That's like two things, right?                                                                       |
| 44:38      | Who wants to do two things?                                                                          |
| 44:40      | But you can create a, yeah, you can create a shortcut.                                               |
| 44:42      | It fills all that out, uses the template in [[Obsidian]], does its thing over there, then                |
| 44:47      | it goes over to notion, adds the record, does its thing over there.                                  |
| 44:51      | And very quickly, you can go from thought to fully germinated project with just a couple,            |
| 44:58      | you know, shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 44:59      | And I think that's for people on the Apple platforms that that's golden and it makes                 |
| 45:04      | notion to me a lot more attractive.                                                                  |
| 45:07      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                     |
| 45:09      | And I think the other thing is, is if I've had an idea for a show, then you can also                 |
| 45:14      | use the ability to retrieve that information and, you know, just say, hey, I just want               |
| 45:19      | to create an [[Obsidian]] note for this upcoming show, which is already in notion, and you               |
| 45:24      | can just grab that data and pull it out and use the same setup to create that [[Obsidian]]               |
| 45:29      | note with the information that's come from the record.                                               |
| 45:33      | And that to me is the beauty of this kind of automation, where you're building something             |
| 45:38      | and you go, okay.                                                                                    |
| 45:39      | So I want to create a notion record and I want to create an [[Obsidian]] document.                       |
| 45:42      | And if I create the notion record first, that data feeds my [[Obsidian]] document.                       |
| 45:47      | And then you can go, oh, wait, I didn't create the notion record, but I can just select the          |
| 45:52      | notion record and feed that into my shortcut that creates the [[Obsidian]] document and bam,             |
| 45:58      | you've got suddenly two automations which solve problems.                                            |
| 46:02      | And that's, you know, that's really where the whole magic begins.                                    |
| 46:07      | You know, you're not just doing one thing, you're doing more than one thing, but because             |
| 46:11      | you're doing more than one thing, you can break it down a bit further and make it do                 |
| 46:15      | even more.                                                                                           |
| 46:16      | Well, I am happy with our venture into notion.                                                       |
| 46:21      | I feel like I've got my arms around it more than I did our old system, because frankly,              |
| 46:25      | it's easier to have everything in one place.                                                         |
| 46:28      | And the automation is further advanced than I expected, both inside the notion automation            |
| 46:35      | tools and the stuff we're able to do from the outside with tools like Nautomy.                       |
| 46:39      | And if your notion curious, don't let the lack of automation hold you back.                          |
| 46:45      | I'm going to put the big caveat here, though.                                                        |
| 46:47      | I don't think notion is the solution for your personal operating system.                             |
| 46:50      | I don't think that you should really build out your whole task and notes and all that                |
| 46:56      | into notion.                                                                                         |
| 46:58      | And there's a lot of people out there that would argue with me that it's great, but it's             |
| 47:01      | an online only service.                                                                              |
| 47:04      | If you're putting your data with somebody else, I'm much more of a fan of kind of keeping            |
| 47:07      | it local.                                                                                            |
| 47:08      | Or if I'm going to put it in the cloud, I'd prefer, frankly, an Apple's Cloud, because               |
| 47:12      | I think they do a better job of protecting security and with advanced data protection,               |
| 47:16      | you can end to encrypt it.                                                                           |
| 47:19      | End to end encryption is not an option with notion, to my knowledge.                                 |
| 47:21      | I looked into it and wasn't able to find anybody finding a way to do that.                           |
| 47:26      | So there are limits to what it can do.                                                               |
| 47:29      | But if you're on a team of people, whether it be small or large, notion is an excellent              |
| 47:33      | tool to keep everybody on the same page.                                                             |
| 47:36      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 47:37      | And I think with all of these things, if you're going to send hate mail about notion not being       |
| 47:41      | a personal operating system, that FYI is for David.                                                  |
| 47:44      | If you want to use notion, go for it.                                                                |
| 47:46      | I think there are other options out there, but at the same time, a personal operating                |
| 47:52      | system should benefit you.                                                                           |
| 47:54      | And maybe you don't need a personal operating system.                                                |
| 47:56      | Maybe you need an operating system for recording a podcast, which is exactly what we've done         |
| 48:00      | in notion.                                                                                           |
| 48:01      | You need an operating system for organising this really weird, crazy, complex work project           |
| 48:06      | where some people like viewing things like this, other people like viewing things like               |
| 48:09      | that.                                                                                                |
| 48:10      | And the problem is, is when people are looking at things two different ways, they don't see          |
| 48:14      | all the same stuff.                                                                                  |
| 48:15      | Believe it or not, we have this problem at work.                                                     |
| 48:18      | And so by having some kind of system that brings it together so everybody is looking                 |
| 48:23      | at the same data with just two different views, that's better.                                       |
| 48:28      | And that is where something like notion really does excel.                                           |
| 48:31      | And the fact that it has automation built into it, and it has integrations now with                  |
| 48:35      | things like Zap here, and Make, formerly Integromat, and you can add if this and that                |
| 48:42      | and so on, if you want to.                                                                           |
| 48:45      | And there's options using things like Automate and [[Drafts]] and so on on your devices.                 |
| 48:51      | I think that that's the point where it goes from, this is a really great idea in theory              |
| 48:57      | with 17 caveats to, this is a pretty good idea.                                                      |
| 49:00      | You know what?                                                                                       |
| 49:01      | This appeals to me, I'm going to give it a shot.                                                     |
| 49:04      | And I think with all these things, you can learn so much in automation-wise and also                 |
| 49:09      | just tech-wise and about yourself by experimenting with these things, because that's what we're      |
| 49:15      | doing here.                                                                                          |
| 49:16      | We're like, you know, our automation system for automators, it's not finished.                       |
| 49:20      | There is no such thing as finished as long as this podcast continues to go, our system               |
| 49:23      | will still continue to evolve.                                                                       |
| 49:25      | And if it doesn't continue to evolve, let's just say we're probably doing it wrong.                  |
| 49:30      | Because, you know, we're hosting this podcast.                                                       |
| 49:32      | We should be continually evolving and adapting our systems.                                          |
| 49:35      | And if we're not, then I feel like we're failing you as our listeners.                               |
| 49:39      | And so the fact that we have switched to [[Notion]], are we going to stay here forever?                  |
| 49:43      | Who knows?                                                                                           |
| 49:44      | We don't know what's going to come out next year.                                                    |
| 49:46      | We don't know what's going to come out next week or tomorrow.                                        |
| 49:49      | But we do know that this is working very well for us right now, solving the problems that            |
| 49:53      | we have, and we have less automation now in our system, but we have a better system.                 |
| 49:59      | And that actually is perfect for us at this point in time.                                           |
| 50:03      | Are we going to add more automation in the future?                                                   |
| 50:05      | I guarantee it.                                                                                      |
| 50:06      | What will that look like?                                                                            |
| 50:07      | I don't know.                                                                                        |
| 50:08      | You'll have to tune in in a couple of months to find out.                                            |

| 51:25      | This will make sure that you still keep the personality and the communications you send.             |

| 51:38      | I use TextExpander every day.                                                                        |
| 51:40      | It helps me deal with email.                                                                         |
| 51:41      | It helps me fill in forms.                                                                           |
| 51:43      | It does so much for me.                                                                              |
| 51:45      | I literally have thousands of TextExpander snippets.                                                 |
| 51:48      | I've been using the app for years and I'm totally sold.                                              |

| 52:30      | Okay, Rose, let's set a notion aside for a minute.                                                   |
| 52:35      | What are you working on in terms of automation, else-wise, these days?                               |
| 52:40      | Well, so one thing I've been working on and I need to figure out a little bit more automation        |
| 52:44      | on this, to be honest, is instructions.                                                              |
| 52:47      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 52:48      | This is going to sound really boring and some people are immediately going, eh, and what?            |
| 52:54      | You have my full attention.                                                                          |
| 52:55      | This is the kind of stuff that I'm excited about, so I don't care.                                   |
| 52:58      | Just tell me about it.                                                                               |
| 52:59      | Well, so it's one of these things, right?                                                            |
| 53:01      | We all have friends and family members who are perhaps not so great with technology,                 |
| 53:07      | right?                                                                                               |
| 53:08      | Or we have something that we need to do from time to time where we're just like, we just             |
| 53:11      | need set by staff instructions on this is what you need to do and how you're going to                |
| 53:16      | do it.                                                                                               |
| 53:17      | And I've run into a couple of these scenarios at work recently.                                      |
| 53:20      | I've been doing some other things.                                                                   |
| 53:21      | One of my colleagues is unfortunately going to be out for a while.                                   |
| 53:24      | We don't know how long.                                                                              |
| 53:25      | And so I've been doing a number of things that she used to do.                                       |
| 53:29      | But one of the things I realised very quickly is if you send an email in text that says,             |
| 53:35      | do this, do this, do this, people will just skim it, right?                                          |
| 53:40      | And they'll just jump straight to like step 13.                                                      |
| 53:43      | And it's like, okay, but you missed steps one through 12 because you thought you knew                |
| 53:46      | what you were doing.                                                                                 |
| 53:47      | But actually, the order of steps three and four are really, really, really important.                |
| 53:51      | If you did those wrong, that's not going to work.                                                    |
| 53:54      | You're going to do everything wrong.                                                                 |
| 53:55      | And so I tried to figure out, okay, can I do something better?                                       |
| 54:00      | I actually messaged you about this, David, because ages ago on Mac Power Users, there was              |
| 54:04      | a recommendation of a service and it started with a C and no longer assists.                         |
| 54:08      | So it's somewhat moot, but I thought it was a Mac like menu bar application where you                |
| 54:12      | could just like take a couple of screenshots, write some text and be like, ta-da, here's             |
| 54:16      | some pretty instructions.                                                                            |
| 54:17      | And turns out it was an online service and you sent me some other recommendations and                |
| 54:21      | so on.                                                                                               |
| 54:22      | And I was like, eh, I don't want a service for this, you know, especially for things                 |
| 54:26      | that I'm predominantly using it for.                                                                 |
| 54:27      | This is a work related.                                                                              |
| 54:29      | So I don't want to just be shoving a bunch of work stuff into a cloud that I haven't                 |
| 54:32      | cleared up with my boss and so on.                                                                   |
| 54:33      | That's just going to cause problems.                                                                 |
| 54:35      | And so I was trying to figure out what I could do and I was like, you know what, there's             |
| 54:40      | a couple of really great apps that are really great for like writing, like, I don't know,            |
| 54:45      | [[BBEdit]], like it's, I've loaded ginormous and I, when I say ginormous, I mean like                   |
| 54:51      | multimillion word documents into [[BBEdit]] and it didn't even blink in me.                             |
| 54:56      | Like that's how great [[BBEdit]] is.                                                                    |
| 54:58      | And I was like, and there's this really lovely app by this guy called [[Brett Terpstra]], nobody's       |
| 55:03      | heard of called [[Marked]], which can take a markdown document and preview it really nicely.             |
| 55:09      | And it's got custom themes.                                                                          |
| 55:11      | Hmm.                                                                                                 |
| 55:12      | Interesting.                                                                                         |
| 55:13      | And, you know, if I use something like say [[Shortcuts]], then I could just create a folder              |
| 55:20      | and create a document in that folder and open that document in [[BBEdit]] and marked.                   |
| 55:25      | And if I use bunch, then I can actually just prompt myself so I can have like, you know,             |
| 55:31      | shortcuts open to that folder, it's got that in open [[BBEdit]] with the whole, with all of             |
| 55:36      | the instructions in the folder and open and so on.                                                   |
| 55:40      | And then I can just select the right one and open it and marked and I was like, hmm, you             |
| 55:44      | know what, we're onto something.                                                                     |
| 55:45      | So I spent like 20 minutes working on a custom theme.                                                |
| 55:49      | And I created some really pretty PDFs.                                                               |
| 55:52      | And when I say pretty PDFs, I sent these to a couple of people and they were like, oh                |
| 55:56      | my gosh, it looks amazing.                                                                           |
| 55:57      | It must have taken me hours to do and I'm there going, seriously, I spent like 10 minutes            |
| 56:02      | working on the design to be fair, I am a web developer, I do know how to manipulate CSS              |
| 56:07      | and so on, designing a custom theme for marked for somebody else may take a bit longer, but          |
| 56:11      | there's lots of really great things that you can just steal off the internet out there               |
| 56:14      | to be honest.                                                                                        |
| 56:17      | So you know, I didn't spend very long doing that.                                                    |
| 56:18      | And then I literally just a couple of screenshots, wrote some instructions in markdown and then      |
| 56:23      | exported it as a paginated PDF using marked and sent it over.                                        |
| 56:28      | And you know what?                                                                                   |
| 56:30      | The person I sent it to did every single step because I made them nice and spaced out and            |
| 56:34      | they've got like nice big numbers next to them that have got like a little circle around             |
| 56:39      | them and everything showing you number one, number two, number three.                                |
| 56:42      | And I've sent a couple of different ones of these instructions to a couple of different              |
| 56:45      | people so far.                                                                                       |
| 56:46      | And everybody has done every step and I have not had to have the back and forth of no,               |
| 56:51      | you did steps three and four, the wrong way, no, seriously, trust me, you need to do them            |
| 56:54      | in the, I know you think it's the same thing, but it's not the same thing.                           |
| 56:57      | Please do step number three and then step number four.                                               |
| 57:00      | No, don't start with something that you already think you started the right way to start from        |
| 57:03      | the beginning.                                                                                       |
| 57:04      | There's been none of that.                                                                           |
| 57:05      | I've just been creating these and it doesn't take me a lot of time.                                  |
| 57:10      | So my shortcut very simply asks me what it like, what are you writing instructions about?            |
| 57:15      | And it creates a folder for me and then it creates a template markdown file in that folder           |
| 57:20      | because in marked or when you use marked, if you put some custom headers at the top                  |
| 57:28      | of the document, then it can read those and it knows what template to use and so on and              |
| 57:32      | so forth.                                                                                            |
| 57:34      | And this is all in the marked documentation, which is really good.                                   |
| 57:38      | And so I have it create a folder and then a file with the same name inside of that folder.           |
| 57:44      | And then that's opened up in Finder, that folder for me.                                             |
| 57:48      | So then whenever I take a screenshot, I can just drag it into that folder because I'm                |
| 57:51      | using clean shots.                                                                                   |
| 57:52      | So when I take a screenshot, it appears it hovers up in the bottom left hand menu and                |
| 57:57      | I can use clean shot to annotate things with like a little arrow and stuff like that in              |
| 58:01      | there as well.                                                                                       |
| 58:02      | So this is all very, very simple and easy to use.                                                    |
| 58:06      | And I just drag it into the folder, rename it to something nicer and I can just pop it               |
| 58:10      | into my text.                                                                                        |
| 58:12      | And this is working really well and I'm getting some very pretty looking instructions out            |
| 58:16      | of this, which people are liking and they are following.                                             |
| 58:20      | And it sounds very nerdy to be very excited about writing technical documentation, but               |
| 58:26      | you know what?                                                                                       |
| 58:27      | I'll take it because I am very happy with what's happening here.                                     |
| 58:30      | No, that makes total sense.                                                                          |
| 58:33      | I'll tell you, I'm using a service for training because I do have people I work with and I           |
| 58:37      | want to make sure they get stuff right.                                                              |
| 58:40      | And as Sparky, the screencaster, I have the best tools in the business to make professional          |
| 58:46      | screencasts, but I don't want to do that just to show somebody how to process a new customer         |
| 58:53      | or something.                                                                                        |
| 58:54      | I just want to make a quick screencast for them to show them.                                        |
| 58:57      | And I signed up for a Loom account, L-O-O-M.                                                         |
| 59:00      | And man, that is super useful for quick automated screencasting.                                     |
| 59:06      | Like you just make it, you send it, it saves a link to their cloud so you don't have to              |
| 59:11      | deal with the file.                                                                                  |
| 59:12      | You do very basic edits.                                                                             |
| 59:14      | It's nothing that I could ever use for like a field guide or even as a, as a lab video.              |
| 59:19      | But it does work for, you know, getting quick instruction across.                                    |
| 59:24      | So like if you wanted, I think your situation is different, right?                                   |
| 59:28      | But for me dealing with people where I'm showing them how to do something online or something,       |
| 59:32      | Loom is so fast and it's just such an easy way to do it.                                             |
| 59:36      | The other thing I'm finding I use it for, sometimes I get emails from people that are,               |
| 59:39      | you know, I've been around the internet a long enough people sometimes send me personal              |
| 59:42      | emails that, you know, have something they're dealing with or whatnot.                               |
| 59:45      | And sometimes I'll just make them a video.                                                           |
| 59:47      | Like you don't know, you don't want to respond to serious text with text sometimes because           |
| 59:52      | text is so one dimensional with something like Loom.                                                 |
| 59:54      | You can just make a quick video, send them a link and you're good.                                   |
| 59:58      | So yeah, I find Loom is a somewhat related tool that I think automators would be interested          |
| 01:00:05   | in because it just makes the process so quick.                                                       |
| 01:00:07   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:08   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:09   | And I think for me, the other part of this is if I created videos, which trust me, I was             |
| 01:00:14   | tempted to create videos is first of all, I'm a perfectionist.                                       |
| 01:00:18   | I'm going to want to get it 100% right and that could take a very long time.                         |
| 01:00:22   | And the other thing is if something changes, like even just a little bit as part of this,            |
| 01:00:26   | then I have to go and make a whole new video.                                                        |
| 01:00:29   | And the idea with these documents is I'm sticking them all in a SharePoint folder.                   |
| 01:00:32   | Oh my God, I'm using SharePoint, but you know what, it's the right place for it because              |
| 01:00:36   | I have a SharePoint folder where a bunch of people kind of go in and look at these and               |
| 01:00:39   | download them.                                                                                       |
| 01:00:41   | And you know, if there's something that you need to check, they can, you know, I'm sending           |
| 01:00:46   | them a link to the document so they're always going to be going and checking the latest version      |
| 01:00:49   | rather than sending them an attachment.                                                              |
| 01:00:53   | And yeah, if something changes, you know, if we change the name of something, I can                  |
| 01:00:57   | just open up all of these in [[BBEdit]] because [[BBEdit]] can open a folder of files as well.               |
| 01:01:02   | And I can just find like that phrase and replace that phrase anywhere that I need to.                |
| 01:01:07   | And I can just do it as like globally, just replace everything that says the bananas with            |
| 01:01:12   | bananas and pajamas, you know, obviously silly example.                                              |
| 01:01:17   | But you know, I can do that or I can, you know, analyse it on a case-by-case basis and               |
| 01:01:21   | replace it here, don't replace it there, skip, you know, and so on.                                  |
| 01:01:24   | And that for me is very, very powerful.                                                              |
| 01:01:27   | Videos obviously are fabulous for a lot of things.                                                   |
| 01:01:29   | I think at least work-wise, I'm going to leave those to the person who is currently making           |
| 01:01:34   | a whole bunch of training videos for our customers because these things I'm doing at work very       |
| 01:01:39   | much intended as internal documentation is what is this feature?                                     |
| 01:01:43   | Why do we have it and how does it work?                                                              |
| 01:01:45   | And so on.                                                                                           |
| 01:01:46   | So, yeah, but I've sent a couple of these to my parents as well.                                     |
| 01:01:50   | My dad was asking me, wait, so how can I work that John Lennon thing on Apple thing, what's          |
| 01:01:56   | it?                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:57   | And like, you know, I've, I just, you know, took a couple of screenshots and showed him              |
| 01:02:02   | how to do it and he's watching the new John Lennon documentary and he's happy.                       |
| 01:02:07   | So, you know, working with family and with friends, which definitely works for me.                   |
| 01:02:12   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:13   | That John Lennon, I watched the first episode of it, it made me so sad, but yeah, yeah.              |
| 01:02:19   | You do need to know your audience when you're doing that training stuff.                             |
| 01:02:22   | Like, I think of Rose were to send videos to her fellow developers saying, just watch                |
| 01:02:25   | my video, they would throw, they would not throw virtual daggers at her, they would                  |
| 01:02:32   | probably throw actual daggers at her.                                                                |
| 01:02:34   | So you've got to know your audience.                                                                 |
| 01:02:36   | So I have definitely sent videos to my colleagues before on things where I was trying to explain,    |
| 01:02:42   | but at the same time it was very useful because it was like, okay, well, here's what I'm seeing      |
| 01:02:46   | when I do this thing.                                                                                |
| 01:02:48   | And if you just sent somebody like 10 screenshots, then they kind of have to like look at it         |
| 01:02:52   | and piece it together and make a mental video.                                                       |
| 01:02:54   | So sending somebody like a quick 10 second video of like I click and then like this thing            |
| 01:02:58   | happens and it sets off fireworks and it's very weird.                                               |
| 01:03:03   | That's much more beneficial for that sort of thing, but that's not really as a documentation         |
| 01:03:07   | thing.                                                                                               |
| 01:03:08   | It's just like, here's a quick example of what I'm seeing and what's going wrong.                    |
| 01:03:11   | And then usually we end up, you know, hopping on like a screen sharing call and I'm figuring         |
| 01:03:15   | it out together.                                                                                     |
| 01:03:16   | But yeah, I have sent videos before, but usually as a, this thing's being weird, like                |
| 01:03:22   | does anybody else see this thing being weird?                                                        |
| 01:03:24   | Oh, right.                                                                                           |
| 01:03:25   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:26   | When it's weird, like you need to do this thing to work around it.                                   |
| 01:03:28   | And yeah, we should really fix that or something like that.                                          |
| 01:03:31   | Are you still using Bunch for your contextual setups?                                                |
| 01:03:34   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:03:36   | So I have a bunch, which will help me like go into documentation mode.                               |
| 01:03:40   | I've literally called it docs mode and DOCS, just to be clear.                                       |
| 01:03:46   | And yeah, it opens [[BBEdit]].                                                                          |
| 01:03:48   | It has, it tells [[BBEdit]] to open the folder where all of the instructions are.                       |
| 01:03:54   | It activates marked, it puts [[BBEdit]] and marked split screen and then it puts finder on for          |
| 01:03:58   | the folder with all the docs in on my other screen for me.                                           |
| 01:04:02   | So that I have, because I'm using [[Moom]] to place everything as part of the bunch.                     |
| 01:04:07   | So Bunch is opening up stuff and then running [[Moom]] and the other thing it puts on my other           |
| 01:04:11   | screen is shortcuts and it's just opening shortcuts to the folder where that shortcut                |
| 01:04:16   | is.                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:17   | So either I can work on existing documentation or I can create a new one really easily and           |
| 01:04:20   | it's all just right there.                                                                           |
| 01:04:22   | Do you, because I've been using [[Keyboard Maestro]] like this for years for setting context.            |
| 01:04:29   | I'm always tempted to try Bunch, but I've got this thing called inertia, right?                      |
| 01:04:32   | I've already got all this stuff built out in [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                       |
| 01:04:36   | Are there features in Bunch that don't exist in [[Keyboard Maestro]] have been used both?                |
| 01:04:40   | I mean, what's the case for me taking the time to move over?                                         |
| 01:04:44   | I feel like we may need to do this in a future show, but...                                          |
| 01:04:48   | I mean, I feel like technically everything that you can do in Bunch, you could do in                 |
| 01:04:52   | [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                    |
| 01:04:53   | But for me, [[Keyboard Maestro]] is like, it's like here's like the process of the chain                 |
| 01:05:00   | of things.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:01   | So for example, like hitting, like when we start recording automators.                               |
| 01:05:05   | I use a macro in [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                   |
| 01:05:08   | It's very exciting, folks.                                                                           |
| 01:05:10   | You're never going to guess what it's called.                                                        |
| 01:05:11   | It's called start recording and timestamp.                                                           |
| 01:05:14   | Whoa.                                                                                                |
| 01:05:15   | Oh, gosh, I can feel the excitement coming through right back at me.                                 |
| 01:05:21   | So I use this and what it does activates [[Audio Hijack]] and it starts the recording and it             |
| 01:05:25   | sets the timestamp in the [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.                                                    |
| 01:05:28   | So whenever I hit my foot pedal on my [[Stream Deck]], then it goes into the [[BBEdit]] document,           |
| 01:05:34   | which is the show notes and then it's a return key and then pastes the timestamp with a colon        |
| 01:05:39   | so I can just type whatever after that so that Jim are fabulous editor who seriously,                |
| 01:05:44   | one of the best automation hacks for podcasting is to get a really great editor like Jim and         |
| 01:05:49   | then he will just make magic happen.                                                                 |
| 01:05:51   | But then we can send him this, well, I say send.                                                     |
| 01:05:54   | We put it in with all of the audio so that there's no sending, there's no asking for                 |
| 01:05:58   | things back and forth.                                                                               |
| 01:05:59   | It's just, it's all together.                                                                        |
| 01:06:00   | If there's something missing, then he knows he needs to ask for it.                                  |
| 01:06:03   | But it's all right there and then we just have all of that together.                                 |
| 01:06:08   | So I use [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros for things like that and I do have macros run as part               |
| 01:06:13   | of some of my bunches.                                                                               |
| 01:06:17   | I don't know what the right word is there, but bunch for me is very specifically, I want             |
| 01:06:24   | a bunch of applications opened, hence bunch, and maybe a couple of other things to happen.           |
| 01:06:31   | But it also closed stuff off for me, but I've never really gotten into [[Keyboard Maestro]]              |
| 01:06:36   | for the whole setup thing.                                                                           |
| 01:06:37   | My [[Keyboard Maestro]] menu bar list is, I want these automations to be available to me.                |
| 01:06:44   | It's right next to fast scripts and bunch and I know that there's overlap between all                |
| 01:06:50   | three of these.                                                                                      |
| 01:06:51   | I'm very aware of it, but I like the fact that if I click on my bunch menu bar, then                 |
| 01:06:56   | that's just like, get me ready to do this thing.                                                     |
| 01:06:59   | Get me ready to join a meeting.                                                                      |
| 01:07:01   | Get me ready to write docs.                                                                          |
| 01:07:02   | Get me ready to write some code.                                                                     |
| 01:07:03   | Get me ready to do some code review or something like that.                                          |
| 01:07:08   | This is all day job examples where if I click the [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro, it's, hey, let's           |
| 01:07:14   | clean up a whole bunch of files that are probably floating around that we don't need anymore         |
| 01:07:19   | and stuff like that.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:20   | And fast scripts is, hey, so I'm going to want like five different things open in iTerm              |
| 01:07:26   | at the same time, go, just do it for me.                                                             |
| 01:07:30   | So yeah, there's overlap, but I love the menu bar aspect.                                            |
| 01:07:34   | I think for me, that's a big part of it.                                                             |
| 01:07:36   | Well, I mean, in our fancy new notion, we have an idea called setup showdown and this                |
| 01:07:41   | is a preview because I don't really think it matters, which one you use.                             |
| 01:07:45   | If we do that show, I will definitely figure out bunch and be able to talk about it intelligently.   |
| 01:07:50   | But whether you do it with [[Keyboard Maestro]] bunch, you can also do it with shortcuts,                |
| 01:07:58   | not quite as well, but you can do it.                                                                |
| 01:08:02   | But the idea is you push a button and your computer sets it up and then your brain sees              |
| 01:08:07   | it and says, oh, here's all the apps that I answer email in or here are all the apps                 |
| 01:08:11   | that I develop code or I write contracts in or whatever and everything is ready.                     |
| 01:08:16   | Now my brain says, there's no excuse, stop goofing around, do the work and it works.                 |
| 01:08:21   | It works.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:22   | It really works on you.                                                                              |
| 01:08:23   | So we want you to do that.                                                                           |
| 01:08:25   | That'll be a show we do next year and stay tuned for that.                                           |
| 01:08:28   | I think perhaps for me, the big thing with bunch versus [[Keyboard Maestro]] for this specifically       |
| 01:08:33   | is that if I were to change my default browser, for example, I could just search everywhere          |
| 01:08:38   | for Firefox and I can just replace Firefox with Chrome or whatever it is.                            |
| 01:08:44   | I'm not planning on doing that.                                                                      |
| 01:08:45   | I prefer Firefox personally for a number of reasons for at least my development work                 |
| 01:08:49   | and the rest of the time it's [[Safari]].                                                                |
| 01:08:52   | But if I were changing [[Safari]] to [[Safari]] technology preview, I've done that, gone back and forth      |
| 01:08:58   | on that multiple times.                                                                              |
| 01:09:00   | And I actually use a variable for that because I'm a nerd, why wouldn't I?                           |
| 01:09:06   | But I could just find a place because I have all of my bunch macros, well, bunch is just             |
| 01:09:14   | a whole bunch of files.                                                                              |
| 01:09:16   | And just like you love [[Obsidian]] because it's just files, David, that's one of the reasons            |
| 01:09:19   | why I love bunch.                                                                                    |
| 01:09:20   | [[Keyboard Maestro]] is brilliant.                                                                       |
| 01:09:22   | I love [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                             |
| 01:09:23   | You will never take it away from me.                                                                 |
| 01:09:25   | If you try to take it away from me, I will be very upset with you.                                   |
| 01:09:28   | But I just use them differently, I guess.                                                            |
| 01:09:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:32   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:33   | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:34   | Well, that's something we're going to talk about next year.                                          |
| 01:09:35   | Oh, yeah.                                                                                            |

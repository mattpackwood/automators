| 02:10      | So the question here is, can you automate moving a task between lists?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 02:16      | Yeah, and the answer to this is yes, but before we do that, I would like to ask                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:22      | if Michael has looked at reminders, smart lists, because reminder smart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02:26      | lists might actually eliminate the need for this entirely, because if you have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 02:31      | a smart list, which just shows you all the things that are due today, then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 02:35      | you don't have to go ahead and actually move things around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 02:38      | Now, of course we can move things around and we'll talk about that in a second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02:41      | But I feel like reminders smart list get overlooked at times because they are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 02:45      | just such a useful tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 02:46      | I mean, there is a built-in one called today with anything that is overdue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 02:50      | or due today or actually as well, the things that are nearby geographically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 02:55      | If you've got geographic or reminders on things, there's also scheduled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 03:00      | and so on as well, but you can create your own as well even if you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 03:04      | I even think that built-in lists might be enough for Michael, the today list,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 03:08      | because once you click it, then it disappears from that list, but will                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 04:01      | But once you've chosen, say, iCloud, you can actually tap to change a list into a smart list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 04:06      | And the filters that you have there are pretty awesome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:10      | So obviously you've got tag filters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 04:12      | You have date filters, which look for any date today on a day, on a particular date                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:18      | before a particular date, after a particular date, within a specified range                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 04:22      | or a relative range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 04:24      | So it's in like within like the next one day, week, month, year, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:30      | But then there's even an option for no time,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 04:42      | Or, you know, all the other options that there are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 04:46      | But I do think that this is like becoming a much more powerful app than people realised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 04:52      | and, you know, it's nice to see that there are options there for like including                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 04:58      | and excluding specific lists and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:00      | A lot of people, reminders have suddenly become the automation solution that they needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:06      | And maybe they don't feel like they need anything complex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 05:10      | It's still got the ability to just be a checklist app, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:12      | But it's got the ability to go from a, okay, I was fine with the checklist app,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 05:16      | but now I've got this thing that's more complicated that I need to manage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 05:20      | Well, you can still stay in your app of choice and then get all those upgrades if you need to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:26      | And I use reminders for, you know, things like when I get in the car                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 05:29      | and I want to get out of the car, remind me to do this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:31      | because that pops up on my phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 05:33      | And guess what, Reminders just has native CarPlay support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:36      | Yep, they have integrated so well in the operating system because it's from Apple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 05:47      | That said, there are limits to the automation and reminders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 05:52      | Like the smart list we were talking about, there are strange limitations like location that you can pick,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 05:57      | like say it's in this list, but you can only run that for one list, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 06:02      | if you want to check for multiple lists, which is, it seems like a very common thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:07      | Like if this is in, you know, this list or that list or that this list, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:11      | if you've got like 10 lists, you want to say it's in these three, doesn't really do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 06:15      | Oh, I thought you could include multiple lists, but I guess I misunderstood that one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:21      | because I was using in any filter and I thought like, I thought it included multiple lists,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:28      | but it doesn't appear to be doing that for me now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 06:30      | Maybe I had a beta feature that disappeared on me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 06:32      | Once you use the list command, then it disappears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 06:36      | So when you, let's say, you know, let's say it's in the reminders list,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:41      | you say, but I also want to check to see if it's in the MacSparky list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 06:44      | Well, you don't get that option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:46      | You know, once you use it once, it's like the command disappears,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 06:49      | which almost feels like a bug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:51      | I mean, why wouldn't they make it, you know, available to include that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06:55      | Or just make it a simple multi select list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 06:57      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:58      | I mean, they just, but they don't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 07:00      | And so that's weird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:02      | But the trick around that really is it has tags and the tag support is excellent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 07:07      | and you can have an include or exclude tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 07:09      | So if you kind of, if you're willing to live in the world of tags with your reminders,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 07:15      | I think that's the smartest way to go if you want to have complex smart lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:20      | But hopefully someday they figure some of this out and they fix some of these limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:25      | Yes, yes, I hope so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:26      | But in for the meantime, I think that Michael can certainly get a long way with just looking at the smart lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 07:33      | But to go back to the original question of can you change the list of something in reminders?                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:38      | The answer is yes, using shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 07:41      | Of course you can now because Apple relatively recently with IRS 15 added an action,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:48      | which allows you to edit a reminder and or specifically it's for updating our reminder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:55      | So if you open shortcuts and then you go to the app section, if you're me,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:59      | this will take a little while to load because you've got a lot of apps there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:02      | But once you've done that, you can find the reminder section and look and there is this action called edit reminder.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 08:08      | So you'll need to probably do a search in reminders first or find reminders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 08:13      | But then you can use this edit reminder and there's three sections of this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 08:18      | There's set which defaults to just set and you can't change that to start with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 08:23      | And then there's detail and then reminder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:25      | So usually I do a find reminders action and then a repeat with each and use the edit reminder action on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 08:33      | But once you tap on the detail option, you can change the list, which is where it lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:37      | And then you can select which list you're moving it to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:41      | So in this case, I'm guessing Michael's going to want to look for all of the tasks which are repeating,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:48      | which are not due within the next 24 hours that are on, say, the today list and then move them to the to do list and vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 08:59      | But what is really useful is if you were to say want to set the tags of a list,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:05      | once you tap on tags, if you go back and you tap on the set option, then you'll see that changes to add set remove and remove all.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09:13      | So if you want to add multiple tags to a reminder, then you just change the detail to tags and then you can update it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:21      | So that's another way around looking at that, which is really useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:25      | But I think that Michael can definitely solve this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:28      | Just needs to get a little creative with the find reminders action and then off to the races.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:34      | Another clever trick with reminders is if you create smart lists that have tags like our tag based smart lists,                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:41      | and then you drag a untagged task from like your inbox to that list, it applies those tags to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:49      | It gives the criteria to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:52      | So like if you have a list that says it has to be in project X and have two tags and you drag a clean task in that has nothing attached to it to that smart list,                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:03      | it puts it in project X and adds those two tags, which is kind of a quick way to automate, you know, tagging and indexing if you're using a tag based system.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10:12      | I discovered that by accident and I was like, oh, that's kind of kind of neat that they did that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:18      | Yes, yeah, I think that's really cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10:20      | It's certainly a lot easier to do on say an iPad or a Mac than it is on the iPhone, though on the iPhone now because you've got the ability to do, you know, sort of multi tap.                                                                                                                                            |
| 10:31      | So if I pick up a task by tapping and holding on it, then I can then use another finger or usually what I do is I'll pick something up with my thumb of one hand                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10:40      | and then move around using some of my other hand to navigate to move this to, you know, wherever it needs to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10:48      | So you can do it on iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 10:50      | It's perhaps a little easier on bigger devices where you can, you know, multi window, but it's very useful to be able to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:58      | Either way, I still am with OmniFocus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:01      | It is the automation king for so many reasons, but I really want to give a thumbs up to reminders as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 11:09      | I mean, they've really come a long way and it's very reminder, it's very automation friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11:14      | Definitely, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:16      | Caleb is struggling with shared notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11:20      | So you want to talk through it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:24      | Yeah, yes, I will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11:26      | Caleb wrote to us and said that they have been sharing notes at the place that they work at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11:32      | So they repair vinyl leather and cloth seats and sort of vehicles boats and restaurants, which sounds like a really cool job as a side note Caleb.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11:39      | Yeah, that's taking the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11:42      | And yeah, so they repair pretty much anything to do with those materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:45      | And part of the business is going to car dealerships and repairing vehicles there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11:48      | So they look through cars, make use notes, write a small description of the vehicle with the year that make the model stock number.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11:54      | A small description of what needs to be repaired and then Caleb adds a picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11:58      | So the manager can look at it and decide, yes, okay, we do want this fixed or no, we don't want this fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12:05      | And it's really easy with all the managers who've got iPhones because you can just share a note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12:10      | Side note, by the way, Caleb, instead of sharing a note, I would actually have a folder for each garage and then share the whole folder with them.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 12:16      | Because then you don't have to share a note every single time you're just sharing a whole folder and that's even easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12:23      | But the problem comes up with those managers who aren't using iPhones, they're using Android and Caleb would like to know if there is a solution.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:34      | Because they're all out on Apple, know nothing about Android except it's extremely frustrating like Windows with a lot of laughing emojis.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 12:42      | And I hear you Caleb, it's one of those things, collaborating cross-platform, a little tricky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12:48      | So I have a suggestion for you here and it's actually something that is not one of my favourite applications, but it is perfect for this use case.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:57      | And that is [[Notion]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:59      | Because [[Notion]] has the ability to do sort of like shared pages, but you can also have a folder with lots of shared pages in.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 13:07      | And you can, if you want to even, you know, take that and make it into a sort of mini database and similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 13:13      | You don't have to do that though, you can just have pages and share them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13:18      | And if you want automation for this, then you also have the brilliant [[Nautomate]], N-A-U-T-O-M-A-T-E by [[Alex Hay]], maker of [[Toolbox Pro]], which adds all of the automation options for [[Notion]] into [[Shortcuts]].                                                                                                                    |
| 13:31      | So what you could do is you could even have a shortcut ask, you know, pop up and ask you for, you know, the make, the model, the year, the stock number of the vehicle and ask you to take a picture.                                                                                                                      |
| 13:42      | And then it could pop up and go, OK, is this an iPhone or an Android person?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 13:48      | That's it. Personally, I probably go with put everything in one system and get everybody into one place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 13:54      | So you use [[Notion]] to share everything with everyone, rather than some of it goes into notes and some of it goes into [[Notion]].                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 14:00      | Just because of, you know, for me, one of the things that I try and do is I always try and streamline my workflows so that there's fewer differences where I have to, you know, work around.                                                                                                                               |
| 14:10      | Oh, but because this person's on Android, I have to go and do everything like this, whereas this person's on Mac, so I do everything like that.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 14:16      | I try to just have one system that works for everyone. But I would certainly look at something like [[Notion]] for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:22      | I don't know if you've got any other suggestions, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:24      | Yeah, I mean, I think what you're looking for is a common platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 14:28      | And let me back up a little bit. The first thing is I would not be looking for a new solution for everything. Notes is working for you.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 14:36      | It's a very good solution for that. So I would, with my iPhone people, stay there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 14:42      | I would not try and get one solution to solve all problems. I would say with notes with Apple people and Android people, I would be looking for something else.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 14:50      | Now, you don't want to get something that requires your customers to buy an app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 14:54      | He had written in the email, he said, I'd even be willing to pay for the app for the customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 14:58      | But that, just the whole idea of it is just not going to work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15:00      | Yeah, that's difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:02      | I went through the same thing when I was in the law practice at one point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:06      | I had moved a bunch of my clients into base camp thinking, well, we'll have this common base camp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 15:10      | And, you know, getting your clients to adapt software for you never works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:15      | And I learned that lesson the hard way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:17      | So you would want, rather than an app, you would want some common platform like [[Notion]] is great because they just get a link.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:24      | They click it. They don't have to install any software and they see it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15:27      | And that may be the best because it's, you know, quote unquote user friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:32      | I mean, [[Notion]] really isn't that user friendly, but compared to the other options I'm about to share it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:36      | Because I was thinking the Google app suite is a good one too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 15:39      | Like you could do it with a Google doc or possibly a sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:43      | You could do it with an air table sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:45      | But, you know, I'm wanting to put the pictures up and everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:48      | I think [[Notion]] may be the best piece of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 15:51      | But what I would recommend to Caleb is just take a look at several of those and see which one you're most comfortable with.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 15:56      | And then try sending it to, you know, your wife slash girlfriend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 16:02      | Some friend of yours that is not tech savvy and just beta tested on some friends and say, hey, how hard is this for you to understand?                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 16:12      | You know, make a funny list like what's your favourite movies or whatever, but have them check the boxes and look at the pictures and find which ones land for them the best.                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:21      | And then you share that with your customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:23      | But it's going to take a little work on your behalf either way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:27      | And at the end of this, the product isn't as good as using Apple notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:31      | So keep that for your folks that are on Apple platforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16:36      | One of the things I did just think of is notes sharing actually doesn't necessarily need the other person to be on iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16:47      | Because there is notes in the cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16:50      | So if you were to share a public link with somebody, then that would be a little easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 16:58      | Now, the difficulty with that is, you know, if they open it on something that just doesn't really support it very well, it's really difficult to test like what it's going to look like because there's so many different androids.                                                                                        |
| 17:11      | And so many people have got different network setups and everything that you may find that you send somebody a link and it works with manager A at garage A and it doesn't work with manager B at garage B, even though, you know, they have both on Android.                                                              |
| 17:25      | So definitely do some exploring there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 17:27      | But I'd probably be looking at something like [[Notion]] because when they open it, it's just a web page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 17:33      | You can have stuff that they can fill in or they can just reply and send you a message and say, yes, please fix this or no, we're going to leave that one.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17:40      | So, yeah, fingers crossed, it works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 17:43      | You know, it just occurred to me, maybe Kraft would solve this problem too, because you can publish a Kraft page.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 17:50      | But I haven't experimented with it with a non-account user being able to add feedback to the form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 17:57      | But you may want to take a look at Kraft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 17:59      | That may do it too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 18:00      | And that's a much nicer app than [[Notion]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:02      | Yeah, though, I have to say [[Notion]] has come a long way, especially now that they have the API and everything, which is how Nautomate came into existence.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 18:11      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:12      | All right, well, there's some options, Caleb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:14      | Let us know how it goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 18:17      | We got a bunch of email about home automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:20      | Weird, though, several of them were asking about doorbell camera recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:25      | I don't think we've ever talked about it as much as we've covered automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:28      | We haven't gone down the doorbell camera rabbit hole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 18:31      | I think, Rose, probably, have you installed one in your home?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:35      | I've got three running around, not in my home, but across three homes, because I have my house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 18:40      | Of course, my parents have their house, and then they have their place in France.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 18:43      | And so there's three different solutions running around there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18:46      | And I have a common theme with every single doorbell camera, which is none of them are great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 18:52      | Every single doorbell camera seems to have a flaw, you know, like rings decent, but then you have to pay $5 a month for the recording options.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:00      | And then eufy's fine, but they had that whole thing about they didn't accurately disclose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:06      | that if you were having images sent to you that it was being uploaded to a server, which, I mean, to me, as a developer,                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 19:14      | it's kind of obvious that that would be how it worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 19:16      | But I understand completely why people are very upset about this,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:19      | and eufy should have done a better job of explaining what it is that was happening and how and why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 19:24      | The Netatmo one, I believe, or was it the Logitech one?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 19:30      | Like they're both big on one of them overheats in sunshine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 19:34      | Like it doesn't have to be warm, but if it's just in direct sun, it just decides it is too hot and shuts down.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:41      | And most doorbells don't have home kit support, which is just kind of rubbish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:47      | So I don't know, David, like my parents have got a eufy doorbell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19:52      | They just have it record to the base station.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:56      | And I'd already set it up to just send them a blank, like a text-based push notification when the doorbell was pressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 20:01      | It wasn't sending them any images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:03      | So, you know, there was no problem with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:06      | The one that they've got in France is some no-brand thing, which does power over Ethernet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:11      | And it's OK. It's not great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 20:14      | And the one I have here is one that doesn't exist anymore, which is the Ring People doorbell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:19      | And the reason why I have that is because I live in an apartment or a flat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:24      | and I didn't really want to start like mounting doorbells to frames or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 20:29      | I wanted something that I could just pop into the door and that was the only option at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20:33      | Now I have a 3D printer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 20:34      | I could, of course, you know, grab pretty much anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 20:37      | But I've not seen a lot of great options out there with home kit support, which is a bit of a shame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 20:43      | Pretty much everything requires you to go through scripted S-C-R-Y-P-T-E-D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:50      | That's a great solution that can like bridge pretty much any camera into home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 20:56      | Or, you know, some other workaround to get it into home kit, which is not amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:02      | What are you using right now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:03      | Yeah, I'm using the Eufy and I want to talk about Eufy as soon as we finish this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:07      | But I bought it years ago and when I bought it, they had a post up in their forum that they were working on home kit.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:15      | And that never happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:17      | I mean, it's been years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 21:18      | I've always been a little disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:20      | I don't remember where I read it now, but, you know, I felt like the company did kind of break a promise about that,                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 21:26      | that they were going to add it to home kit and they didn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 21:29      | Yeah, it's one of those things that their doorbell department is a different department to that camera department.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 21:34      | So the cameras have home kit secure video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:37      | If you buy a home kit compatible camera, there are cameras that don't have home kit secure video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:42      | But the doorbells are from a different department, which is the lock department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:46      | And so they don't have home kit support, but some of the locks are now getting home key support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 21:52      | It's confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:53      | It's one of those things where they're a huge company and they're more like Samsung than most people would think.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 21:58      | So there's a lot of, you know, different departments that don't actually talk to each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:01      | So just because they have technology in one place doesn't mean they actually use it somewhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22:05      | And that said, I really haven't missed it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 22:08      | The way it works is it rings and whenever someone pushes the button, it takes video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:15      | Whenever it detects motion, it takes video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 22:18      | And occasionally I will go back in the UV app and look at what it captured now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22:23      | So I have been satisfied with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 22:26      | I understand why people are upset with UV. I am too, because I've recommended them on a podcast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:31      | And then this whole thing went down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 22:34      | And for people who aren't aware, some security folks figured out that UV was uploading some images from the cameras as part of their system.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:45      | And then when they were asked about it, they said, oh, no, we're not we're not doing that at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 22:49      | And then, of course, the security researchers proved that they in fact were so there was a misrepresentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:55      | And I think they really did mishandle it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 22:58      | I don't think this was malice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 23:01      | I think it was probably just, you know, some mistakes were made, you know, as they say, mistakes were made.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23:08      | Yeah, no, it's one of those things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:10      | Doorbell cameras, I have to say having a home kit doorbell is a great thing because I have my ring doorbell bridged through scripted into a home kit.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23:19      | And I love the fact that if I'm watching TV, it pops up on TV when somebody appears at the door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 23:24      | So then I just hit pause and I like I because I've already seen them coming like I see them wander up to my door.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 23:30      | I know that they're coming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23:31      | So I've already hit the pause button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 23:32      | I checked to see whether or not they're coming to me and I'm at the door to meet them, which is great for, you know, delivery people and so on.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 23:38      | So certainly advantages to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 23:40      | But my personal recommendation would be to look for something doorbell wise with like RTSP support or something that say scripted supports.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23:52      | And then if you have like a Raspberry Pi or something at home, then you could run scripted on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:57      | Or if you've got like a Synology NAS, you can run it on there too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 24:08      | But look for something with good reviews where, you know, people who care about personal security and privacy have reviewed it and say, yeah, this is cool.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 24:18      | And we like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:19      | You know, I'm not getting rid of my eufye stuff. I'm fine with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 24:22      | But I'm also not sure that folks listening to this will be happy to to hop on the eufye Bandwagon unless they're already there right now.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 24:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 24:31      | And for my, the way I decided, because I've already invested a lot in eufye and the external facing cameras are still turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:37      | I don't care, you know, if they even upload some stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 24:40      | In my case, they may get a picture of a skunk or a rattlesnake once in a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:44      | But the, but the endear stuff I have turned over to home kit, which means that the resolution drops down to one K.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:52      | But, you know, I kind of like having home kit managed anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24:55      | I really trust Apple for something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24:57      | And even then I've got my cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:00      | If I'm home, my internal cameras aren't running anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:03      | So they only turn on when I leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 25:05      | So it's not that big of a deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 25:08      | But yeah, that's that's an interesting question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:11      | But I do think I agree with Rose is very handy to have a doorbell camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:15      | And, and I understand it's frustrating because it's just not a clear solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 25:20      | Hopefully as [[Matter]] kind of gets more distributed out there, some of the problems like this will go away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:28      | But I still think we're a year or two from that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 25:30      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 25:31      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:32      | It's, it's one of those things where [[Matter]] is a lovely concept [[Thread]] is a great protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 25:39      | Just so folks know I saw a really good description of this in the home assistant discord the other day,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:45      | which is for anybody who's going, wait, [[Matter]], [[Thread]], I don't really understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 26:09      | It's how it talks to something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:10      | So something can be [[Matter]] compatible, but it may not be [[Thread]] compatible and vice versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:15      | You can have a threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:16      | You could have threat compatible things that aren't [[Matter]] compatible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:18      | Now that's that particular one is unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 26:21      | But in general, you know, just keep an eye out for for this stuff when you're looking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:26      | But I think it's going to take a while for this stuff to really kick off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:29      | You know, we're seeing more devices pop up with threat support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:31      | We're seeing things like the Amazon Echo devices have [[Matter]] support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 26:36      | They've got like phase one of it, phase two, starting to roll out early next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:40      | Amazon has said that they'll be announcing at CES how they're going to add iOS support and home kit support to this stuff,                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 26:46      | which is pretty great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 26:48      | But the thing that I'm excited about, David, with [[Matter]] is specifically that devices are going to have to be able to connect to like five hubs.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 26:56      | OK, so you're going to be able to connect something to say an Echo system, a Google home system and home kit and home assistant and Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 27:06      | Let's sort of fifth one there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27:07      | So it should be able to connect with all of them at the same time to talk to each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 27:12      | So that doesn't mean that you're going to have to say like, well, I've got a choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 27:15      | Do I want to use this with, you know, the native app or home kit?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:20      | It'll be both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27:21      | It'll be yes and instead of either or, which is, I think, pretty cool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:25      | Fingers crossed, it's going to bring great things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:28      | But I seem to already be benefiting from a lot of what [[Matter's]] going to bring thanks to the fact that I'm using [[Home Assistant]].                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:34      | Yeah, and I really think that we people also lose track of the thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 27:38      | You know, there's a thing in productivity called the gap, not the gain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27:41      | And where people look at the gap of how far they have to go rather than how far they've come and home automation really fits in that to me.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 27:50      | Like we've come so far with home automation and things that used to feel impossible are now pretty easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 27:56      | And so I'm really curious to see where this goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:58      | I am super into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 27:59      | I've been having a great time automating my studio because it's like my space so I can really do whatever I want in here.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 28:06      | I am waiting for that human presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:09      | Sensor Rose, I ordered that the day you and I talked about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:12      | That was like two or three months ago on the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 28:14      | I cannot wait for the thing to show up because it really does cause a problem for me not having it to say, OK, there's a human in there now.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 28:22      | And now there's not a human in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:23      | If I just get that reliably into the system, it changes everything, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:28      | Well, fingers crossed fingers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:30      | All the express put me at the top of your list, please.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:34      | I have to say, David, after two to three months, I just I don't go back and double check on the postage stuff there in case it got stuck with like customs or something.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 28:41      | I I I generally wait like two, maybe three weeks for stuff to arrive from Aliexpress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 28:47      | So it's been a little longer recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 28:49      | Thanks to the fact that there's been a lot of UK postal strikes and, you know, similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:53      | And, you know, fingers crossed, they those folks are actually going to get the raises that they deserve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 28:58      | But, you know, generally my stuff arrives in a couple of weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:01      | So definitely go back and double check on the postage there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:04      | Oh, OK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 29:05      | So I thought it was just like you'll get it when we decide to send it to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:09      | So OK, I need to look into that because it has been much longer than two or three weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 29:14      | We don't talk about Windows enough on the show.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:16      | You know, this is the automators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 29:17      | We're not just about Mac, but, you know, that's a lot of the stuff we talk about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 29:20      | We got a Windows email from Gavin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 29:24      | You know, he's been trying to figure out how to automate Windows 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:27      | And he found a thing called the task scheduler and it has a ton of extendability with special triggers and the ability to run programs with command line options.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 29:37      | He said, I'd love to hear a podcast in the future about how you could leverage some of this Windows technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:43      | I think for now I just want to point that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:46      | If you're out there and you're on Windows Task Scheduler is a thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:50      | It sounds like Gavin kind of stumbled into it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 29:53      | Yeah, yeah, it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 29:55      | It's been there for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 29:57      | I think I remember using Windows XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 29:59      | It's one of the common ways that you can set up applications to launch a startup on Windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 30:05      | It's definitely worth looking into and checking out because, you know, as Gavin says, you can run stuff on a schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:11      | You can run things with command line parameters or just scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:16      | And bonus, Gavin, if you look into it, you can open web pages at certain times as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 30:22      | So that's definitely worth looking into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30:25      | I don't actually have a Windows machine anymore, David, anywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 30:29      | Yeah, neither.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 30:30      | So it may be a little difficult for us to actually do an episode on this, but I bet you we can find a guest to come on and talk about how they are automating things on Windows.                                                                                                                                           |
| 30:40      | In fact, if you're listening and you're a Windows automator, you should reach out to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 30:44      | Yeah, or if you're like, oh, I don't know if I deserve that title. I'm a wannabe automator. Reach out anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 30:50      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30:51      | I just just recently I took off my my my parallels installed because I just don't use it and it's just too much work to keep it up and it uses a lot of drive space.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 31:01      | But the yeah, I just don't use Windows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:03      | But I will say Microsoft has always had a healthy attitude towards automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:07      | Like I remember as a lawyer, I used I wrote a ton of programs and word basic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:13      | Did you know that word had its own programming language? And I used to generate a lot of lawyerly stuff based on programs I'd write in that word basic application.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 31:25      | And there's just really cool stuff on the Microsoft side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 31:28      | And I'm always happy to hear about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:30      | I'm glad they're still doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:32      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 31:33      | I remember doing a lot of stuff in Visual Basic for Excel and similar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 31:35      | So, you know, there's plenty of options out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 31:39      | And it's just maybe not quite as user friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:43      | It is kind of sit down and write a little mini script for it rather than drag and drop a couple of blocks around and keep up my stroke.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:49      | But it definitely works incredibly well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:52      | Kirk wrote in about image automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:54      | He says, I have a folder with bracketed images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:57      | He's a photographer and I'd like to take five images at a time and put them in a folder then have the next five go to the next folder until all the images in the main folder are in sub folders.                                                                                                                          |
| 32:07      | Sometimes there could be up to 150 images or more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:11      | Naming isn't a huge deal since I can easily rename the folders at the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:14      | However, naming them sequentially on creation would be a big bonus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 32:19      | Currently, I'm doing the whole process manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:21      | Ah, it just gives me pain to read that sentence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:25      | And it's not a big deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 32:27      | Kirk, it is a big deal and I should be nice to automate it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:30      | So, Rose, how are we going to solve this problem for Kirk?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:32      | Well, Kirk has said automator or shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:35      | Automator and shortcuts can do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 32:37      | They absolutely can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 32:39      | I'm just going to say, let's slide step here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 32:42      | You could do this in automator or shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:44      | I feel like it's going to be pretty darn painful to do it in either of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 32:48      | I would jump straight to [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:51      | Because if you do it in [[Keyboard Maestro]], then you can get all of the selected items in Finder and it can iterate over them and you can set variables and then create folders based on that.                                                                                                                               |

| 33:13      | I'm going to leave myself a 0.2% flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 33:16      | If Kirk were to go to the [[Keyboard Maestro]] forum and say, hey, how would I do something like this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 33:22      | I've got to start up with the repeat with each selected item in Finder and make directory stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 33:28      | But I'm kind of stumped on how to do the rest of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 33:30      | Somebody's got to have a solution for them in 48 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:33      | Maybe a little longer because it's the Christmas period and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 33:36      | I'm sure a lot of folks are taking a little break from the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 33:39      | But I'm pretty certain that you're going to get multiple suggestions on how precisely to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 33:44      | But you can definitely do this pretty easily with [[Keyboard Maestro]] off the top of my head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33:50      | I don't have an automation that will do exactly this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:54      | But I have automations when we finish recording automators will create the folder for the episode and move them into there.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 34:01      | Just automatically so that our lovely editor Jim has a slightly easier time of finding all of the episode files that he will need for the editing.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 34:12      | So I'm pretty confident that that can be done with [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:17      | I think you can do it with shortcuts too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 34:19      | I just feel like it's going to be more difficult than it needs to be to do it with shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 34:25      | File management tools even though shortcuts does have some of those now [[Keyboard Maestro]] has more and it is more customisable for this problem.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34:34      | And this is absolutely a solved problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:37      | So Kirk let us know but I don't even think you need to go to the forums and say I've done this much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:42      | You could say I'm a [[Keyboard Maestro]] newbie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 34:59      | But I think if you you spend like you know 10 15 minutes playing with it you're probably going to get a fairly good start on it already.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:06      | Especially if you've seen shortcuts before you know there are similar actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 35:09      | They may not have exactly the same name but there there's definitely going to be commonality between them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:15      | And honestly [[Keyboard Maestro]] you're going to love it as a photographer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:18      | It's got a lot of very useful tools in there that are just going to make your life easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 35:22      | Yeah I thought for a minute if he should look at [[Hazel]] for this [[Hazel]] is very good at file management and naming.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:27      | But because of the way it is the sequential five and then the next five there may be a way to do with [[Hazel]].                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 35:34      | But I think [[Keyboard Maestro]] would be the easier solution for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 35:38      | Sorry there may be a way to do with [[Hazel]] but I think [[Keyboard Maestro]] really is probably the right tool for this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:44      | I would suggest that because like this is going to be a folder of images and it's going to be a new folder repeatedly [[Hazel]] be the wrong job for this.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:52      | [[Hazel]] be the right job to just watch a folder and permanently do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 35:55      | But it's not the right tool necessarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 35:58      | I mean I have done this where you can just be like OK I just want to organise all the things in this folder [[Hazel]] have at it.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:05      | But it's not something that I would be turning to every single time I wanted to solve this problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36:10      | I would solve the problem once in [[Keyboard Maestro]] and then just you know select the folder or the files in the folder and then the macro and be done with it.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:18      | Yeah and if you want to be really clever you can get yourself a Stream Deck and you get KM link and then you push a button and it happens and you feel powerful.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:26      | Yes exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:28      | We're going to talk someday about my Stream Deck shows because I have more now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:32      | Oh no David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36:34      | I'm just going to leave it there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 36:36      | I'm going to tell people I'm going to tell people David sent me a picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:40      | OK there are so many Stream Decks in the picture I can't count them David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36:44      | Yes I was trying to figure out how many buttons I have now because I got two excels so I have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:49      | You have two excels and a plus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 36:51      | OK so you have 40 buttons four knobs and like and so those four knobs are technically also buttons because you can press them but they can also turn left and turn right.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 37:00      | Yes and then you've got the touch screens and then you've got the pedal which isn't visible in that screenshot.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 37:06      | Yes I know it's starting to look like an F16 in here but I love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:11      | I mean the pedal is super useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:13      | I'm using it right now as we take notes for the show so yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 37:18      | We got an email and this Jeff wrote in about window resizing and management and that this is like red meat for Rose and I we cannot avoid when he sent this email and they're like oh this is definitely going in.                                                                                                         |
| 37:29      | And we were talking about moving and resizing in episode 72 and I explained that I think that keyboard mice was a little clunky with it when you're using percentages or pixel counts to set your windows sizes because you know if you change your screen size or whatever it's just always clunky.                       |
| 37:46      | So he says he has a better solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:48      | He has a keyboard mice from macro which gets and displays the current mouse coordinates in a pop up window triggered either by a hot key or a Stream Deck button.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:57      | Boy man Jeff is my kind of nerd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:00      | I can tell you that already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 38:01      | Then he positions the window he wants and moves the resize exactly where he wants it on the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:06      | He moves the mouse to the top left position of the window to trigger get mouse coordinates macro which is something you do with keyboard mice.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:13      | So you're getting the exact location on the screen of the mouse then you go the bottom right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:17      | You do the same thing and then it drops the window in between those two spots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:22      | And that's very clever and he can configure it with a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 38:27      | I thought that was kind of a fun way to resize windows so you just put the mouse at the top left in the bottom right.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:32      | You trigger the coordinates in each one and you make the window fit in between those two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 38:36      | That is an easy macro to write and I think that would be kind of fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 38:40      | Well what I really like as well is Jeff saying that he has like a pop up screen appear on the window with the coordinates of the mouse as well so that he can then actually use that in other things.                                                                                                                      |
| 38:51      | Now what would be ideal here is then if you can just have [[Keyboard Maestro]] like dynamically figure that out and then be like OK.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 38:57      | So like left 50% or left 30% is this or because I'm not on an ultra wide I'm going to be left 50% and so on which I'm sure you can do is get required perhaps a little more work.                                                                                                                                          |
| 39:10      | But I don't think I'm going to be moving away from [[Moom]] anytime soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:14      | But [[Keyboard Maestro]] I am very grateful has the ability to move windows because I do have it move you know windows to different displays and so on.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:23      | And I don't know if you've discovered this David if you disconnect a display from your Mac like sometimes the window will be like 95% off the screen.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:32      | So you just have to look for it and you're like where is this and then there's like the close button is the only bit of the window you can grab.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:38      | That's where [[Keyboard Maestro]] is moving windows comes in so I'm just like yo [[Keyboard Maestro]] stick this in the middle of my window please get back please.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:45      | And and it does it I have I have a key for that and it just it just solves that problem which is brilliant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 39:51      | Yeah I like you I really have kind of evolved to just using [[Moom]] and you know [[Moom]] has an [[AppleScript]] support.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 39:58      | I don't know if we've talked about in the show but you can run an AppleScript it's a one line AppleScript that triggers a [[Moom]] preset like.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 40:05      | Before we record I have a podcast recording [[Moom]] setup that puts you know the Safari in just the right place and the recording software in just the right place and it just runs an AppleScript and it does that for me.                                                                                                  |
| 40:18      | I have that same thing David but I've got it in a bunch action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 40:21      | Yeah a bunch will open all the apps that I need and then it runs [[Moom]] to shuffle everything around into the right spaces and so useful absolutely love it.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:30      | Bunch is really probably the best solution for this [[Keyboard Maestro]] is probably the second best solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 40:35      | Lately I've been playing with coding those setups into shortcuts just as a as a curiosity you know as a nerd I just want to see if I can do it and you know you do get some tools and shortcuts you don't get with bunch.                                                                                                  |
| 40:49      | But ultimately bunch is so much better at this with with shortcuts it gets confused about whether the app is open or not and if you try to open it is.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:58      | It just shortcuts isn't quite ready to do setups the way that bunch can do it so easily but in any of those you can run that AppleScript at the end.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:08      | So you say all you got to do is splatter those windows on the screen and then you use the magic of [[Moom]] and that AppleScript to set the windows exactly how you want.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 41:17      | And if you're someone who always wants them in the same place this is a great solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 41:22      | Now I get the impression that the Jeff is is probably wants to change the setups a lot you know because he's got this thing where he can just put his mouse there and say OK now put it there.                                                                                                                             |
| 41:33      | And if you want to change them more frequently I don't think that the [[Moom]] AppleScript thing is necessarily the best although you can always adjust them in [[Moom]] you can go and say you know overwrite the existing setups with the current one and then you're you're good but.                                          |
| 41:46      | But I really do like that AppleScript I don't know why I can't just use bunch and be done with it I always want to try different ways to do these setups but.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41:55      | If you're if you're an automator and you haven't figured out how to automate your your computer setups like say I want to write I want to do accounting or whatever it is you do to pay for your shoes.                                                                                                                    |
| 42:06      | Boy setting up that screen so it automatically puts itself in the exact context of what you need to do that is some really well spent automation time I would tell you that's a good thing to do as you had to head into January if you haven't done it already.                                                           |
| 42:20      | Yeah yeah it's it's definitely one of those things of like if you have meetings on a regular basis or even a not so regular basis like knowing that like certain certain windows will be closed other applications will be minimised and put out the way and so on.                                                        |
| 42:34      | It's just so useful and also you know in my case because I then do run [[Moom]] through part of this it also you know moves whichever application I'll be using to talk to people front and centre.                                                                                                                            |
| 42:45      | So that you know there right there which is really really handy and you know I have to say it's one of those things where I don't necessarily use as much as I could do on my work machine but I use it all the time on my personal machine it's great you know.                                                           |
| 42:58      | I click the bunch icon I click the start podcast recording for automators or just a folder to iOS today or I click the prepare button so that I can prepare things and that does a different series of actions.                                                                                                            |
| 43:10      | You know depending on which podcast I'm preparing for and it's just very useful to know that I've got the websites that I need open I've got you know all the things that I need wherever I need them and it does just make it so much easier.                                                                             |
| 43:26      | So Philip wrote and asked us about a smart garage solution so or rather told us how he turned his dumb garage into a smart garage for less than $40.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 43:38      | Because his garage door motor does not allow him to access any wires for the controller it's a really common motor so he thinks that a lot of people probably got something like this.                                                                                                                                     |
| 43:48      | But he couldn't retrofit something like the Merosss opener which meant that he had to replace the entire garage operating mechanism if you wanted to change it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 43:57      | Except he came up with a better solution for this which was SwitchBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 44:03      | So SwitchBot is a company but the first thing they came out with was the SwitchBot bot and I have a couple of these I actually use them for pressing the power button on my washing machine and then pressing the start button on my washing machine.                                                                      |
| 44:14      | Now but I previously use them for turning on and off my kitchen light and some other things before I was able to get that light switch replaced.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:21      | But SwitchBot basically is a little like rectangle with an arm that comes out and it goes down and it presses something and it goes back up.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:28      | It can optionally have a little sticker so it can pull something so if you've got a switch where you have to like push it and then pull it to change it.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 44:36      | Then it can do that but it can press things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:40      | So Philip has placed the SwitchBot on a spare garage key fob.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:45      | He did try it on the wall switch but it was a cheap plastic button so it couldn't press it hard enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:49      | And then he created a simple shortcut using the SwitchBot actions and now he has a smart garage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 44:57      | And yeah he's really happy with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 45:00      | He is using a SwitchBot hub and if this and that subscription but those aren't necessarily required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 45:07      | If you do have a SwitchBot hub though I would recommend Philip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 45:10      | Take a look at Homebridge or [[Home Assistant]] because they can actually have SwitchBot integration to pull those into [[HomeKit]] for you so that you can actually have them.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:23      | Now they won't at least in Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:26      | It wouldn't show up as a smart garage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:28      | But let's just say my patio door lock shows up as a garage in [[HomeKit]] thanks to [[Home Assistant]] because I just said,                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:35      | hey I'm going to make a fake cover which is a garage door and add it to [[HomeKit]] and it's just going to unlock my front door for me.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:43      | The door that I use is my front door and it's now on my car dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 45:46      | So that Philip is the upgrade that I would suggest to you and that's free as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 45:51      | So you know call that some holiday homework if you want to as this episode is coming out right before the new year.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 45:56      | But yeah it's a great solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 45:58      | I really like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:00      | I feel like SwitchBot is like the, it's like the ultimate like in case of glass you SwitchBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 46:07      | You know it's like the feature in Keyboard Mastery says look for the button on the screen and push it with the image.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:12      | Yeah, yeah it is click it image for [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 46:15      | Yeah this is the physical version of that SwitchBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46:18      | If your coffee maker doesn't work or whatever get yourself a SwitchBot and you literally have a little robot arm that does it for you.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 46:26      | And I keep thinking about what do I have in my house that I could put on a SwitchBot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 46:31      | But I've done a pretty good job of automating and building in the switches where I don't need one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:36      | But there's a part of me that really wants to own a SwitchBot because I just want to make a little robot arm move once in a while.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 46:42      | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 46:43      | I mean honestly David you should just get one for the fun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 46:46      | You can frequently get them for like $25 on Amazon on sale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 46:50      | So keep an eye out for them and honestly you'll probably find something for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 46:54      | I saw somebody the other day and somebody shared a tweet with me that was somebody had had cheaper energy at night time in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 47:03      | And for those folks of you over here in the UK and Europe you'll be aware that our energy prices have dramatically increased.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 47:09      | So anything that you can do to save money seems like a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:13      | And it turns out they had a SwitchBot so they've stuck it on their washing machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:17      | And it never is the start button of like three o'clock in the morning when it's really cheap or relatively speaking when it's cheaper to run the washing machine.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:25      | It's like of course you should do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 47:27      | This is a perfect solution to the problem of I don't have a smart washing machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 47:32      | Buying a new washing machine is not going to be money saving but having something that you know using something like this which you can repurpose for many other things as well that will then allow you to use energy at cheaper times of day.                                                                            |
| 47:44      | Absolutely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 47:45      | Definitely love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 47:46      | You know what I should get one and then put it on top of one of my Aqara switches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 47:52      | So it will literally push a home kid enabled switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 47:57      | That seems like overkill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 47:58      | But why not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 47:59      | Why not go for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:01      | Especially with that they've got they've got a new beta version of the software now which you can enable which allows you to over extend the arm so it can actually push it even further forward if that makes sense because usually it would just come out to be parallel.                                                |
| 48:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 48:16      | To the bottom of the switch but it can actually press further than that if needed now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 48:20      | Another thing Phillip had said is he's using an IFTTT to make it work but you know that that was just kind of his angle to it.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:28      | One question I asked for Phillip is I think the next thing you need to do is install a sensor or something to give you an indication of when it's open and closed because.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 48:36      | Oh yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 48:37      | Aqara door sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:38      | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 48:39      | Definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 48:40      | You know and then then you can really just have the full experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 48:43      | Yeah actually there are SwitchBot door sensors as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 48:45      | I've not heard reviews about them so I don't know if they're any good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 48:48      | I love my Aqara ones because they're so ridiculously tiny and it's great for the moment it yells at me when my kitchen doors left open because I don't have heating in my kitchen.                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:56      | So it yells at me when I've got my system set up so I get repeated messages of like your kitchen doors left open your kitchen doors still open.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 49:03      | No seriously the kitchen doors still open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 49:05      | You should go close it until I actually get up and close it so the heat doesn't escape and you know what it's worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 49:10      | Yeah I put them on my refrigerator door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 49:12      | There's two doors on the refrigerator but they don't always close all the way and the beep that it makes when the door is open is the exact frequency area of my tinnitus so I don't hear it at all if it's open.                                                                                                          |
| 49:24      | So I put the switches up I mean on the door the Aqara door switches and then I get an alert if it's open and it's like problem solved you know it's just great.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 49:33      | And the Aqara hub is such it is such an enabler once you put one of those in your house because you can put some like 150 devices on it and they're at that expensive.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 49:44      | So like any problem you have that you're like $15 of Aqara hardware away from solving it you know so it's kind of awesome you know.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 49:53      | Yeah and at some point Dave will get you to reduce all the hubs and get rid of the hubs and just go all in on [[Home Assistant]].                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 49:59      | I have to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 50:00      | The hub but you know for the time being you can still use all of that stuff so it's pretty great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 50:06      | I need to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 50:07      | So Rose and I did a thing in the MacSparky Labs because I got my Aqara hub and but we have been so busy just in the Sparks house with the holidays and me with work and just things that have been going on.                                                                                                               |
| 50:18      | But I need to spend like a weekend really just like drilling down on that [[Home Assistant]] and I haven't done it.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 50:24      | So for now I have my stuff connected through [[HomeKit]] but I'm eventually going to move it over and I have more questions for you Rose and we're going to do a show on [[Home Assistant]] once this is all done.                                                                                                                 |
| 50:34      | But I want to do this in a way that doesn't mess it up for my family too you know because they all love [[HomeKit]].                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:39      | So I have more questions but we'll get there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 50:42      | Put a pin in that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 50:44      | Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 50:46      | Speaking of [[Home Assistant]] though, Robert has sent a message asking about replacing the Logitech Harmony Hub or Remote.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50:55      | So for those of you who don't know Logitech had and the past tense of this is important a product called the Harmony Hub and the Harmony Remote System which is basically a universal remote with Wi-Fi support so that you can connect to it through Homebridge or [[Home Assistant]] or just the Logitech app on your phone. |
| 51:14      | And it was a smart IR blaster so I could look at what it needed to send to your TV to say hey TV turn on, hey TV switch to HDMI one, hey TV volume up or hey soundbar volume up.                                                                                                                                           |
| 51:26      | But you know it's one of those things where it was an amazing solution for its time but IR based macros are kind of unreliable and that all important past tense Logitech had a product.                                                                                                                                   |
| 51:41      | Yeah, they're not making it anymore and they're not selling it anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 51:45      | Now, Robert has said in the email that he sent in that Logitech isn't going to support it forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 51:51      | I will say caveat to that, the squeeze box which most people have never heard of but it's a Logitech like smart speaker essentially has been sunset for a very long time.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:03      | Logitech are still supporting it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:05      | Like it's just about supporting it but it does still have support so I don't feel like you need to rush away from Harmony, a hub or remote system anytime soon.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 52:14      | I still have mine but I have been moving away from it as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 52:18      | And so Robert continues with I have been watching his home get shortcuts on the third party so far like Homebridge and [[Home Assistant]] for emergency return.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:26      | And it seems like the infrastructure is out there to replace the Harmony remote to which I'm going to say Robert you're bang on the money.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:32      | Absolutely right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 52:34      | And so he's given us some details of the things that he's got and the things that he wants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 52:40      | So basically the tasks are pretty much turning on and off the TV and changing the AV receiver inputs because the TV stays on HDMI one and then he uses a Marantz AV receiver.                                                                                                                                              |
| 52:52      | And he's got a Gem 1 webOS LG TV with no home kit support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 52:57      | And other devices don't really need to be switched or powered on but ideally there could be some kind of device specific control UI.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:04      | So the really good news is Marantz and Denon use the same kind of IP control systems and LG TVs also have [[Home Assistant]] support.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:16      | And [[Home Assistant]] also has Denon support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53:20      | So I'm going to say Robert that I think you should take a look at [[Home Assistant]] for this because I'm sure you could do this in Homebridge.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 53:28      | But I know that [[Home Assistant]] definitely has ways to integrate with a lot of stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 53:33      | If it doesn't have a native support for your version of the LG TV, I'm going to bet a significant chunk of my certainty that somebody out there has made a third party integration for this.                                                                                                                               |
| 53:45      | You're going to be able to control the TV and the receiver and I'm pretty certain that some people have made some nice cards that you can use in the [[Home Assistant]] app to control this.                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:55      | I know I've got a number of different ones for my TVs and so on because I've got a Philips TV and a Samsung TV and I can control both of those completely.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 54:05      | So I think that [[Home Assistant]] is where you should be looking for this because it can control both of the devices that you have as your primary devices and then you've got other options as well.                                                                                                                         |
| 54:16      | It can also integrate with the Apple TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 54:18      | So you've got that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:20      | I'm not sure what options you've got on your Blu-ray player, but it should be able to send things through say HDMI CC to that.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 54:29      | So I would definitely take a look there and see what you can do, but there is going to be a lot of choices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:35      | And best part, you can share this back to [[HomeKit]] as a media player so that you actually can just control it from the control centre on your iPhone or iPad if you wanted to.                                                                                                                                              |
| 54:47      | What are you using for your Blaster?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:50      | So I'm not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:51      | Nowadays, I actually am just using HDMI CC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:55      | So I have the Apple TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 54:59      | I have my Philips TV as my main TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:03      | In the bedroom, I've got a Samsung frame TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 55:05      | And in my living room, I have a Bose soundbar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:09      | Now the Bose soundbar could be controlled through HDMI CC, but because I've also got Nintendo Wii and Nintendo Switch and a couple of other things, I kind of ran out of HDMI ports.                                                                                                                                       |
| 55:17      | So I've got it connected through an optical cable instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55:21      | But I was able to configure the Bose soundbar to just go into a sleep mode so it stays on all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:27      | And it doesn't use any power really at all while it's asleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 55:31      | But then when the TV turns on, it wakes up and it turns on and turning the Apple TV on turns the TV on because it's using HDMI CC.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:39      | Similarly, when I sleep the Apple TV, it turns off the TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 55:43      | So that works perfectly and I just have the volume up and down buttons on the Apple TV know that they need to talk to the soundbar.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:53      | I trained them to talk to the soundbar and that was it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 55:55      | Done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 55:56      | In the bedroom, I didn't even need to do that because the Apple TV specifically is outputting to my home pop minis in the bedroom.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 56:04      | So it controls the volume on those natively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:07      | But yeah, I didn't need to do anything else, but I also don't have any V receiver in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 56:12      | But previously I didn't have an even vaguely smart HDMI TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 56:17      | It was a 12 plus year old Samsung.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 56:22      | It didn't have internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:23      | It was basically just a large HDMI panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 56:26      | It was great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 56:27      | It was totally fine, but it wouldn't turn on when like the Apple TV turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 56:31      | So I was using the Logitech remote for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:34      | But unfortunately that TV died.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:37      | So I replaced it with a Phillips gradient TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 56:42      | So it's got like the colour lights built into the back of it that change colour depending on what's on screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 56:47      | And those are only available over here in Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 56:49      | Sorry folks over in the Northern United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 56:52      | You can't get one of those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 56:53      | You have to buy the gradient strip separately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 56:55      | But yeah, I love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:57      | It works really, really well for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 56:59      | And also it's a very simple system, which sometimes is the best solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 57:04      | I completely get why somebody might have something like the Marantz receiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 57:10      | Those are great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:11      | I personally don't have a need for one, but I can also see why people would definitely want them                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:17      | because it can deal with things like a turntable input, Sonos Connect and so on as well, which is brilliant.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 57:23      | I'm curious about adding a blaster to the studio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:26      | I just haven't done the research yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 57:28      | Like I understand like some of the Aqara hubs can do it too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 57:31      | Like I could run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 57:32      | Yeah, they kind of can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 57:34      | What I would recommend personally is a BroadLink IR blaster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 57:37      | If you want to go for the IR route, the only problem is as Robert has pointed out is IR macros are kind of flaky as in like it just sends a command and it assumes that it was listened to and heard.                                                                                                                      |
| 57:52      | And depending on what that device is that you're sending the command to and how it's programmed, that command may actually doing the inverse of what you hope for.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 58:01      | So it may turn it on instead of turning it off because the turn on and turn off is actually a toggle instead of sending two discrete commands.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 58:12      | So it really depends on the device as to and how it's been programmed, just how it works.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:19      | But the broad link IR blasters are definitely like the one that I always see recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:24      | I have a little one in my kitchen and it does control my kitchen TV, but I don't actually have my kitchen TV plugged in at the moment because it's just not got decent volume.                                                                                                                                             |
| 58:35      | So it's not an impossible to actually listen to something while you're cooking, which I feel kind of defeats the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:40      | So I'd much rather take my iPad in there and connect some headphones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 58:43      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 58:44      | But yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:45      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 58:46      | Well, how's that for a little feedback on the automators podcast?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:50      | I think it's pretty good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:52      | The only problem is, David, did you look at spreadsheet because there's like 476 more lines to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 58:56      | Yes, I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 58:58      | So, you know, some of this stuff is just folks saying, you know, thanks for things and so on, but we are going to be going through way more feedback in the future.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 59:06      | And yeah, I think we're going to have to do this every couple of months next year, David.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 59:10      | But you know what?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 59:11      | That sounds like a pretty good New Year's resolution to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 59:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 59:14      | And if you've got feedback, you can get it to us multiple ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 59:17      | Probably the easiest way is on Twitter, just send a tweet with ask the automators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 59:23      | What's the hashtag again, ask?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 59:25      | Well, if you tweet and you use the automators FM handle on Twitter, then it will pop in there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 59:32      | If you're no longer on Twitter because you've moved off to mess it on and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 59:35      | I will be getting a link to our mess it on account up ASAP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 59:40      | Unfortunately, we don't have one yet, but you will be, you'll have to tag us in your toot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 59:46      | So that we'll actually see it hashtags across instances kind of weird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 59:50      | But if you, if you tooted us, then we will get it when we have a handle, but I will get that up ASAP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 59:56      | Other than that, you can use the email option, which if you go to relay.fm/automators,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:00:01   | there's a way of getting in touch with us there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:00:03   | That will definitely get through to us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:05   | And yeah, of course, posting in the forums always appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:08   | You can go to talk.automators.fm and there's a post for every episode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:00:13   | So if you've got feedback on a specific episode, you can just go and post on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:00:17   | Or if you've got a longer question or something, feel free to create a whole post on separately for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:23   | But yeah, it's definitely something that you should be checking out if you want to talk to some other fellow automation nerds                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 01:00:46   | Happy New Year, everybody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:52   | So, David, how much does your energy cost you at the moment?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:00:56   | Because my bill seems to have gone up massively recently and I've been trying to automate it away,                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:01   | which has been working, I should say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:03   | Well, you know, of course, you know, with what the war going on in Europe,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:01:07   | the energy prices are through the roof right now and I'm sure a lot of people are becoming more conscious of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:01:14   | And of course, Rosemary Orchard is going to bring her automation skills to bear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:01:19   | What are you doing, Rose?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:01:21   | Well, the first thing that I did was look at all the things that were just like running that maybe didn't need to be running.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:01:28   | And so I went around and I've tweaked things like my thermostats and so on so that my rooms don't necessarily heat as much as they may have done otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:01:36   | So, you know, it's only the room that I'm in that's actually heating to a comfortable temperature and the others are, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:01:42   | enough that when I go in, I can say, OK, like, I mean, I'm going to be in this room for a while now,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:01:46   | like switch the heating to here and it's doing it manually now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:01:51   | It's one of those things where I was previously automating it based on, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:01:56   | hey, this room seems to be occupied rather than me actively saying I'm going to be in here for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:02:03   | And so I decided that as much as I love the automated solution, I wasn't going to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:02:09   | There are two exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:11   | If I turn the TV on, so I'm going to be watching TV, then it assumes that I'm going to be in the living room for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:02:16   | And if I go to bed, it assumes that I'm going to be asleep for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:02:20   | And so it keeps that room to a comfortable temperature automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:02:22   | So I don't have to manually do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:02:24   | But that, you know, the TV, the living room one turns off when the TV turns off and the bedroom one turns off when either I get up for work                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:33   | or when I'm supposed to get up for work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:35   | So if I leave it too long, it's going to be a little chillier in the mornings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:02:38   | But yeah, so I started with, you know, the obvious of adjust the automations for things like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:43   | But then the next place I looked was, OK, like, something's costing me money here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:02:48   | What's costing me all this money?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:02:50   | And how?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:02:51   | And so I've been on a bit of a smart plug, energy monitoring smart plug research mission, David, because it turns out there's a lot of energy monitoring smart plugs out there.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:01   | And a lot of them are just rubbish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:03   | They're awful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:04   | They're pretty much all using something called Tuya, T-U-Y-A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:03:09   | So they come with this either it'll tell you to download the Tuya app or it'll tell you to download the Smart Life app.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:03:14   | They are one of the same folks, you know, they look different, but they're all using the same system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:03:19   | And yeah, it sounds all your data back to China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:22   | And doesn't even let you integrate it with other systems, not properly, not guaranteed anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:29   | So yeah, I've been doing some research, but I found some great places that have been been selling and making available other ones.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:03:38   | And I found out what is costing me the most money every day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:42   | And would you believe it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:03:43   | It's my computers, despite the fact that I've got a Mac Studio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:47   | I've got Intel Mac for work, which is obviously going to be using a bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:03:52   | I've got my Synology running and so on, and they're all pretty much running through the same EPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:03:57   | And that's costing me the most amount of money, but that's only just over a pound a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:04:02   | So I think I'm doing all right with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:04   | I have to say, I kind of wish I still had an Intel Mac Pro of some kind, because that would also be heater as well as a computer system,                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:04:15   | like snuggling a Mac Mini or a Mac Studio just doesn't seem quite as smart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:04:22   | But it's really interesting when you actually break things down so that you see this individual device is costing me XML,                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:29   | because I thought it was going to be a lot cheaper to run my dehumidifier to dry my clothes than someone,                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:34   | than it was to run my tumble dryer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:04:36   | Turns out I'm very much wrong on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:04:38   | It's way cheaper to run my tumble dryer than it is to run my dehumidifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:42   | So I have been tumble drying things more than I have been dehumidifying things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:04:46   | Like I'm still running the dehumidifier to make sure that my house doesn't get to a swamp-like level where mold starts growing and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:53   | That would cause other problems, but I'm definitely not using it to dry my laundry anymore because it turns out that's more expensive,                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:00   | which is not great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:05:01   | But hey, I found out thanks to some smart plugs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:05:04   | Yeah, it's kind of cool though that you were able to do that, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:07   | Because you always think you know what is using up all the energy, but it's only once you get the data that you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:14   | Exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:15   | And the other nice thing is because they're smart plugs, you can do more than just get the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:05:19   | You can actually turn them off and on and be smarter about it, right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:23   | Yeah, yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:24   | So my microwave, like every software I get a little power blip and there's a clock on my microwave and I can't turn off the clock on my microwave.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:31   | But the thing that will consistently confuse me is when the clock on my microwave is wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:05:35   | Especially when it's wrong by not a lot or a huge amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:40   | You know, like if it's off by like four hours or something, it's fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:44   | But if it's off by like six or more, for some reason, it breaks my brain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:47   | If it's off by less than an hour, it really confuses me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:05:50   | And so I have been able to actually take advantage of the fact that I was monitoring how much energy my microwave costs me,                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:05:58   | which when I'm not using it is a grand total of nothing per day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:06:02   | So I'm really pleased about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:04   | But I was able to say, hey, by the way, if we get a power blip,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:09   | like schedule the microwave to turn off at like 58 minutes past midnight and then back on at 1 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:15   | So what happens is, you know, if there's a power blip, it will turn off the microwave then at, you know, like two minutes to one in the morning                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:23   | and then it turns it back on at one o'clock in the morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:06:25   | Because when you, when you turn it off and turn it back on again, the time automatically resets to 1 a.m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:06:30   | And that has completely actually solved my microwave having the wrong time problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:34   | So yay, bonus, which is good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:06:37   | And also my freezer has been a little bit flaky recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:06:41   | Fortunately, we've had a lot of snow and ice over here, so I was not too worried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:45   | I was thinking, you know, worst case scenario, I can go out and bury my Ben and Jerry's in the snow outside for a little bit while I figure out the freezer problem.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:06:51   | And I was able to figure out, you know, like, oh, my freezer is not doing any energy and it hasn't been doing it for like half an hour.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:57   | I need to go check on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:06:59   | And it turns out that there were two problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:02   | There was a broken LED, which is still broken, which tells me that the freezer is on and working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:07   | Great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:08   | And the other problem is what the dials is a little bit flaky and I just needed to turn it a little bit more towards a cooler temperature.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:15   | And now it works consistently and everything's fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:18   | So yay for smart plugs because I saved myself the pain of, oh no, my freezer's broken and I've lost all of my frozen food thanks to that.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:07:28   | And I no longer have an incorrect clock on my microwave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:31   | Plus my dehumidifier stopped costing me, I think it was costing me one pound 50 a day at one point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:07:36   | It's like, OK, that is a lot of energy to run a dehumidifier, which doesn't need to be running all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:07:41   | So yeah, saving some money and being a nerd about it at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:46   | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:47   | Well, listen, gang, we usually don't talk much about automators max, but we're at the end of the year and I just wanted to thank everybody for your support as automators max subscribers.                                                                                                                                 |

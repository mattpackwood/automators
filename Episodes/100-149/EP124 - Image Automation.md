| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:03      | I'm David Sparks and joined by Rosemary Orchard.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:05      | And this is The Automators where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for you.                                                                                                          |
| 00:10      | Hi, Rose.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 00:11      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:13      | Excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:14      | Today we are going to be talking about image automation.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 00:18      | Both of us have a bunch of different stuff we do to automate images and we thought it'd be fun to share that.                                                                                                    |
| 00:23      | And we're going to be running the gamut today.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:25      | Multiple platforms, multiple automation systems.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 00:28      | This is going to be a fun one.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 00:30      | If you do anything with photos, hopefully you'll learn a few tricks today.                                                                                                                                       |
| 00:34      | And in the bonus section, Automators Max, we are going to be covering the evolution of our podcast automation nerdery.                                                                                           |
| 00:44      | Rose has gone completely over the deep end on some stuff she's doing.                                                                                                                                            |
| 00:48      | And we're going to talk through that and always tip me to follow her over the cliff because that's what Rose does so well.                                                                                       |
| 00:56      | Is your home really smart if it's not reading your calendar to figure out when you're supposed to be podcasting?                                                                                                 |
| 01:00      | Yeah, there you go.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:01      | Is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:02      | These questions and others may be answered or not later.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05      | OK, well, we're going to talk about that in Automators Max today.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:07      | But the focus today is image automation.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:12      | And we've had this one on the list for a while because both of us have this like bizarre collection of little tools we do to deal with images.                                                                   |
| 01:20      | And I think that's true for a lot of people.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:22      | I mean, there are folks listening to the show that are professional photographers and they've got really expansive automation stuff built out in the Lightroom or Photoshop.                                     |
| 01:33      | That's not really where we're going today.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:35      | We're dealing more with the way people have different types of images and ways to just make that easier with automation because it's not easy to do this stuff manually.                                         |
| 01:47      | It's always hard to remember what the buttons you're supposed to push are.                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:50      | And it takes a lot of time and I feel like this is an area that is absolutely ripe for automation.                                                                                                               |
| 01:57      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:58      | And I think it's one of those things where there are so many different areas of this that we're probably going to end up doing like 16 episodes to cover this in total.                                          |
| 02:07      | Because as we were, you know, preparing for the show, I was looking at it and going, OK, well, depending on what we're talking about with images.                                                                |
| 02:15      | Like if we kind of look at this as a bigger media thing, you've got screenshots.                                                                                                                                 |
| 02:20      | And you've got photos and then you've got like maybe a picture that you took for reference like the other day I was trying to buy some hooks to fit over my doors.                                               |
| 02:29      | And so I measured my door and I photographed like my door with the tape measure on it so that I would know which door it was with that measurement.                                                              |
| 02:37      | And I, you know, I wrote it down as well, but then I've got this reference picture.                                                                                                                              |
| 02:40      | And then on top of that, you know, it's not technically an image, but you've got video that you record as well, which, you know, it's not technically images.                                                    |
| 02:48      | But because it tends to be recorded on the same device, it usually ends up lumped into the same category for processing later.                                                                                   |
| 02:55      | And so, you know, you've also got, you know, all the different devices that you may take images on and so on and so forth, which, you know, can make it really tricky to actually get started.                   |
| 03:06      | And this is one of the reasons why I think image automation is such a useful tool, even if it's just something relatively simple, like what my dad does,                                                         |
| 03:15      | which is at the end of the year, he takes all the pictures that he's taken throughout the year, regardless of what camera it's on.                                                                               |
| 03:20      | And he renames them all, and he's just using Finder's built-in rename for this, by the way, and he just, you know, gets it to just set the file name to the date and time that the picture was taken.            |
| 03:31      | And then it's really simple, you know, because he's just sorted it in Finder by the date time column and he just renames it.                                                                                     |
| 03:38      | And, you know what, it works great, and Finder has a batch rename and screenshots on Mac have got customisations, and I feel like those are a really good place to start.                                        |
| 03:47      | Yeah, yeah, I feel like there is a lot to this, you know, when you're talking about reference photos, it's really remarkable to me how nice that is to now have a camera and video camera with you at all times. |
| 04:00      | I mean, I was fixing the toilet the other day, you know, I mean, because that's what you do when you're a homeowner.                                                                                             |
| 04:06      | And, like, there was a thing in the water closet behind it, and I wasn't sure what I needed to replace.                                                                                                          |
| 04:11      | I took, like, four pictures, went to the hardware store, showed them the pictures, and, like, ah, and he takes me right over and says, this is what you need.                                                    |
| 04:18      | And it's like, you know, 10 years ago or longer, that was just not a thing, right?                                                                                                                               |
| 04:23      | You would go in and try and describe it, or you'd rip the toilet apart and bring parts in with you, and now it's just so much easier.                                                                            |
| 04:31      | And I do think people don't think about that enough, like, we make frequent trips to Disneyland as you do when you live in Southern California and your wife works for the company.                              |
| 04:41      | And I always take a picture of the parking spot.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 04:44      | Every time I go, I stop and take a picture of the parking spot.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 04:47      | And then every time I go, I see people walking around.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 04:50      | When I leave, I see people walking around scratching their heads saying, where did we park?                                                                                                                      |
| 04:54      | And they don't know, right?                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 04:56      | Disney's really smart.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 04:57      | They, this is like an automation tube, by the way.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 04:59      | They track where they are parking people by every 10 minutes.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:04      | Like, they're like, oh, what time did you arrive at?                                                                                                                                                             |
| 05:07      | If you arrived at 10, 15, you were on the Mickey level in the sea row.                                                                                                                                           |
| 05:11      | You know, they, they figure it out for you because people are dumb.                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:14      | But I don't ever need that because I take a picture and that's kind of cool.                                                                                                                                     |
| 05:18      | But that also creates a lot of images in your photo gallery that you probably don't want to keep forever.                                                                                                        |
| 05:26      | Yeah, yeah. And, you know, there is a couple of different ways around that.                                                                                                                                      |
| 05:29      | And I think we'll probably get to that when we, when we talk about, you know,                                                                                                                                    |
| 05:32      | our favourite ways to deal with this later.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 05:34      | But spoiler shortcuts definitely comes into play here because you don't need to keep these images forever.                                                                                                       |
| 05:39      | So, you know, you can just have them dumped into a specific folder.                                                                                                                                              |
| 05:43      | But, you know, I think it's, you know, it's, it's surprisingly useful.                                                                                                                                           |
| 05:48      | Actually, I'm going to recommend this as a feature, the, or a tip for people looking to do any image automation.                                                                                                 |
| 05:56      | If you use the photos up on iOS, and even if you don't really use the photos up on iOS,                                                                                                                          |
| 06:01      | if you go to the albums tab and you scroll down and scroll, scroll, scroll to utilities,                                                                                                                         |
| 06:07      | and then you see duplicates, you'll be able to see, yeah, duplicate photos.                                                                                                                                      |
| 06:12      | And it will allow you to just quickly go through and merge things so that you can be like,                                                                                                                       |
| 06:15      | yes, I want these two exact copies to be merged and so on.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 06:19      | And I think that that sort of stuff is a really good way to get started when it comes to just cleaning out the basics.                                                                                           |
| 06:24      | Now, obviously, if you've got thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of duplicate images here,                                                                                                            |
| 06:29      | you may not want to do it on your iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 06:31      | You may want to do it on a bigger device or a more powerful device or using other software.                                                                                                                      |
| 06:36      | But things like that are a really good place to get started.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 06:39      | And I have to say, David, I've been really impressed with, you know,                                                                                                                                             |
| 06:42      | the number of features built into iOS and macOS that can make a handling and wrangling                                                                                                                           |
| 06:48      | and creating these things much easier.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 06:51      | Yeah, it's kind of surprising that this is a new feature.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 06:54      | In fact, I would say that one of the first grounds or first automation tools for people                                                                                                                          |
| 07:01      | with using images is the Photos app, because this app has evolved so much over the years.                                                                                                                        |
| 07:06      | In fact, this duplicate feature, I believe, just came out this year.                                                                                                                                             |
| 07:10      | I don't think that I think this is when they first added it, if memory serves.                                                                                                                                   |
| 07:13      | And I remember the first time I loaded it, there were like thousands of duplicates in there.                                                                                                                     |
| 07:20      | But now it's all handled for me.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:22      | And that's because, you know, I'm married and my wife and I share photos.                                                                                                                                        |
| 07:26      | And, you know, you inevitably get duplicates in your library when you got a house full of people.                                                                                                                |
| 07:32      | But now it's very manageable.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 07:34      | And I can go in there and check it on my phone.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 07:36      | But that used to be a whole thing, right?                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 07:39      | We would have had to write some custom script or get a special app.                                                                                                                                              |
| 07:44      | And now you just go into the Photos app, find duplicates, and it does an excellent job.                                                                                                                          |
| 07:49      | It shows you when the sizes are different.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 07:51      | So you kind of, you know, figure out where you're going with it.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 07:54      | And, you know, you're off to the races.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 07:57      | In fact, let's nominate that as our first automation, the find duplicates button.                                                                                                                                |
| 08:03      | Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 08:05      | And as a follow up to that for anybody who is looking for something perhaps a little bit more powerful                                                                                                           |
| 08:10      | or a different way of doing things, I'm going to also recommend Gemini by Mac Paul.                                                                                                                              |
| 08:17      | I should note there, the creators of Setup who are sponsoring this episode,                                                                                                                                      |
| 08:20      | but that's not why I'm recommending this.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 08:21      | So Gemini on iPhone and iPad is specifically looking at image duplication.                                                                                                                                       |
| 08:26      | And it really tries to be very smart about it.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:29      | And it's all local and on device and everything.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:32      | And then if you are looking at Gemini on the Mac, which is included in Setup,                                                                                                                                    |
| 08:37      | which is sponsoring the show, then you can just do duplicates of like all the files.                                                                                                                             |
| 08:42      | But that includes your photos.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 08:43      | And that could be a very useful tool to quickly go through and just power on and be like,                                                                                                                        |
| 08:48      | OK, and I'm done with this, which, you know, is definitely a good place to get started.                                                                                                                          |
| 08:54      | Yeah, there are some other automations built into the Photos app                                                                                                                                                 |
| 08:58      | that people don't realise are there.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 09:00      | And, you know, I've always loved smart lists.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 09:03      | You know, Mac or the Apple team on the Mac historically has done this great job.                                                                                                                                 |
| 09:08      | We've talked about it on the show.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 09:09      | In fact, I'm assuming your dad might be using some smart lists when he's doing his annual work.                                                                                                                  |
| 09:14      | I'm afraid not.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:14      | My dad's using Adobe Bridge.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 09:16      | Oh, OK.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 09:17      | OK.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 09:18      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 09:19      | Yeah, he's not even using Lightroom.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 09:20      | He's using Adobe Bridge.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 09:22      | And Adobe Bridge does actually have a built-in rename function.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 09:24      | But I got him onto the Finder version a while ago because I thought Bridge might be disappearing                                                                                                                 |
| 09:29      | and I didn't want his workflows to break.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:31      | So, yeah, I'm glad that, you know, Finder can do a heck of a lot as well.                                                                                                                                        |
| 09:36      | Well, it's always bugged me that iPhone and iPad don't get those smart list features                                                                                                                             |
| 09:42      | basically in any Apple app.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 09:43      | Like in [[Apple Mail]], you can create smart mail lists and, you know, in photos, you can do stuff.                                                                                                                  |
| 09:49      | But they don't, while they don't give you that on the iPhone and iPad,                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:53      | they do make their own for you on the iPhone and iPad.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 09:57      | And just like finding duplicates you can find in the Photos app,                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:00      | I would also recommend going through and taking a look at the image smart lists.                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:05      | And you find all sorts of, like, if you just want to see portrait mode photos, you can do that.                                                                                                                  |
| 10:09      | And that really does help kind of cool the herd a bit.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10:15      | Yeah, yeah, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 10:16      | And yeah, it's one of those things as well where, you know, looking at things like, for example,                                                                                                                 |
| 10:22      | if you just go to the screenshots section, then you've got all of those.                                                                                                                                         |
| 10:25      | But also looking at faces.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 10:27      | And if you go through and you're like, wait a second, who is this person?                                                                                                                                        |
| 10:31      | And why is there a picture here?                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 10:33      | Then you can tap on that person and you'll see, you know, all the pictures that they're in.                                                                                                                      |
| 10:37      | And that may be useful for, you know, culling some pictures if that's what you want to do.                                                                                                                       |
| 10:43      | But, you know, it can also just be a nice way to revisit your pictures and see what's there.                                                                                                                     |
| 10:49      | But I certainly find that this can be quite useful,                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10:52      | especially when you've got a picture of something that's misidentified as a person.                                                                                                                              |
| 10:55      | Happens very rarely.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 10:57      | But yeah, when you do that and you're like, oh, OK, right.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11:00      | Well, this is not a person and I took 17 screenshots of the floor or 17 pictures of the floor                                                                                                                    |
| 11:05      | when I was in the hardware store.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11:07      | So I'm just going to go ahead and delete those.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 11:08      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11:10      | So there's your first automation gang go in the photos app.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11:14      | And you can do this stuff on your phone just as easily as you can do it on your Mac.                                                                                                                             |
| 11:18      | So it's just quite handy.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11:21      | And I overall continue to be impressed with Apple's attempt to make photo management easier                                                                                                                      |
| 11:29      | for people.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11:30      | When it first came out, you know, it took a lot of heat.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 11:32      | You know, I photo was very beloved.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11:36      | And I would argue that while it never has got to the level that aperture was, which was                                                                                                                          |
| 11:40      | Apple's, you know, historic power up, photos is on its own now and it's fine for most people.                                                                                                                    |
| 11:49      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11:50      | Man, I might get a lot of email about saying that.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11:52      | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:53      | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 11:54      | But I think for a lot of people, it is, you know, the right kind of thing because it is                                                                                                                          |
| 12:00      | just very simple and easy to work with.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12:05      | But that doesn't mean to say that it is like the right tool.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12:08      | It's certainly not the world's best power tool, but it's surprising, it's got a lot                                                                                                                              |
| 12:12      | of hidden features under the hood, which is definitely worth considering when you're looking                                                                                                                     |
| 12:18      | into this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12:20      | And yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:21      | And speaking of which, you know, like before we dive into our personal recommendations,                                                                                                                          |
| 12:27      | I am actually also going to talk about the macOS screenshots app because with macOS Ventura,                                                                                                                     |
| 12:33      | we actually got an app on our devices called screenshots.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 12:37      | And when you activate this, which you would do usually with Command Shift 3 or Command                                                                                                                           |
| 12:43      | Shift 5, if you want to get all of the options, then you can actually click on like an options                                                                                                                   |
| 12:49      | button, and you can say, okay, I want to save this to documents, or I want to put this image                                                                                                                     |
| 12:54      | on the clipboard when I'm done with it or save it and send it to mail, put it in messages,                                                                                                                       |
| 12:58      | open it in preview, or other location, and you can even do like, you know, timer or five                                                                                                                         |
| 13:02      | seconds, 10 seconds, show the mouse pointer, don't show the mouse pointer, floating thumbnail,                                                                                                                   |
| 13:08      | not floating thumbnail, and remembering your last selections for this stuff.                                                                                                                                     |
| 13:14      | And it will also do recordings as well.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 13:16      | And that can be just, you know, a really good place to start with all this stuff, because                                                                                                                        |
| 13:23      | you know, I have my own preferred app for taking screenshots, but the macOS screenshots                                                                                                                          |
| 13:27      | app is also pretty nice.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 13:30      | And you know, there's also the option which isn't shown anywhere in the screenshots app.                                                                                                                         |
| 13:37      | I'm not quite sure why, but you know what, we'll just pretend that everything's fine                                                                                                                             |
| 13:42      | and that all of the options are there.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 13:44      | But if you use the terminal, you can even change, like, the name and the type of the                                                                                                                             |
| 13:48      | picture that's taken so that you can, you know, have whatever it is, you know, I prefer                                                                                                                          |
| 13:54      | to have PNGs as my format for screenshots.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 13:58      | I'm not sure about you, David, but I find PNGs are often better, they tend to be high                                                                                                                            |
| 14:02      | quality with not taking up huge amounts of space and they give you more options, you                                                                                                                             |
| 14:07      | know, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14:10      | And I will also link to the blog post.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 14:14      | This is from 2015 originally, but don't worry, Fox, it's been updated in 2022 to change the                                                                                                                      |
| 14:20      | name of screenshots on the Mac, because you need to go into the terminal and it's defaults                                                                                                                       |
| 14:26      | right, and then it's com.apple.screenCapture, and then you can set the name, and then you                                                                                                                        |
| 14:32      | have to restart something.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 14:34      | And yeah, that will allow you to change, like, the name of the screenshot if you wanted                                                                                                                          |
| 14:39      | to, which can be really useful if you need something like [[Hazel]] to pick it up later.                                                                                                                             |
| 14:43      | But there's also links there to how to remove the shadow effect and change the file format.                                                                                                                      |
| 14:49      | So yeah, that can be quite useful, and I have to say, you know, I feel like actually the                                                                                                                         |
| 14:54      | name of an image, you know, we're not quite Shakespeare here, but naming files the right                                                                                                                         |
| 15:00      | way is actually important.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 15:03      | Because if I haven't got my files named the right way, I am not going to find them later.                                                                                                                        |
| 15:08      | If times I've opened up shortcuts and found shortcut one, shortcut two, what was happening                                                                                                                       |
| 15:15      | here?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15:16      | Was I just messing around with something or, you know, did something go wrong with the                                                                                                                           |
| 15:19      | sync?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15:20      | It's usually that I was messing around with stuff and not paying attention, but you know,                                                                                                                        |
| 15:24      | unnamed things or badly named things are really difficult to work with.                                                                                                                                          |
| 15:27      | So if you've got or if your screenshots named in a way that makes sense for you, then that's                                                                                                                     |
| 15:32      | definitely a nice way to start coding them up.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 15:35      | And of course, if you just stick them on your clipboard, they don't even need a name.                                                                                                                            |
| 15:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 15:40      | And they have continued to improve that feature.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 15:42      | I guess since we're talking about it, in addition to command shift, the number four                                                                                                                              |
| 15:47      | gives you a crosshair where you can drag and take a screenshot of like a selected section.                                                                                                                       |
| 15:53      | But the real trick there is the space bar, if you hit the space bar, then it takes a                                                                                                                             |
| 15:56      | picture of the window under which you are the mouse is.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 16:00      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16:02      | So you press space and then you select the window.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:03      | When you select the window, it takes a screenshot of that window.                                                                                                                                                |
| 16:06      | It's so good.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 16:07      | That doesn't always give you 100% results.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16:09      | Sometimes if there's a modal window on top of it or something, usually you'll see when                                                                                                                           |
| 16:13      | you do it what it's actually grabbing, but sometimes it doesn't get quite everything                                                                                                                             |
| 16:16      | you want.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 16:17      | In that case, you need to revert to the crosshair.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16:20      | And the other bit of that is it always puts a drop shadow underneath it, but there is                                                                                                                            |
| 16:24      | a terminal command that you have to dig out and run, then that'll take the shadow out                                                                                                                            |

| 19:02      | So David, we were talking about screenshots and the next thing officially in the outline                                                                                                                         |
| 19:08      | is my favourites.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 19:09      | So I'm just going to take you over the show for now.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:12      | But I feel like one of the things we have to talk about here is CleanShot because CleanShot                                                                                                                      |
| 19:16      | is a great screenshot tool for Mac.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19:20      | But I personally feel like it's an automation tool as well because the number of times I                                                                                                                         |
| 19:24      | don't create a file because I didn't need one because I was using CleanShot is actually                                                                                                                          |
| 19:29      | pretty high and not needing to organise a file that I didn't need or get rid of a file                                                                                                                           |
| 19:35      | that I didn't need is definitely, you know, that's automation basics, zero, don't have                                                                                                                           |
| 19:40      | things that you don't need, you know, so if you don't waste, you know, you don't waste                                                                                                                           |
| 19:45      | or if you're time organising or creating [[Hazel]] rules to delete stuff.                                                                                                                                            |
| 19:50      | So I'm using CleanShot.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 19:52      | I'm guessing you're also using CleanShot because it's a great app.                                                                                                                                               |
| 19:56      | And yeah, we should talk about this.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 19:58      | Yeah, I mean, the best way to manage a file is not have a file, you know.                                                                                                                                        |
| 20:04      | So CleanShot, I was resistant to it because I was so good at using the built-in screenshot                                                                                                                       |
| 20:10      | tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20:11      | I thought I was a pro and I'm like, look, I know all the tools.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 20:14      | And I believe it was a year and a half ago, Apple released their screenshot app, which                                                                                                                           |
| 20:20      | picked up even more features that we just got done talking about.                                                                                                                                                |
| 20:23      | I'm like, well, I don't need that CleanShot thing.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 20:26      | But I was already a set app subscriber, it's part of a set app.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 20:28      | So I went ahead and downloaded it and immediately saw that this is superior to the built-in                                                                                                                      |
| 20:33      | Apple tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20:34      | And like Rose was saying, let's just talk about some of the ways I feel this is an automation                                                                                                                    |
| 20:40      | tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 20:41      | One of the other things is you can set a destination to a screenshot, just like Rose was saying,                                                                                                                 |
| 20:46      | so you don't have to save the file.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 20:49      | And that's huge.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 20:50      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 20:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 20:52      | So just for clarity for folks, just like when you take a screenshot on iOS and it appears                                                                                                                        |
| 20:57      | and it hovers in the lower left-hand corner for a little bit and, you know, CleanShot                                                                                                                            |
| 21:01      | has this as well on the Mac.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 21:03      | And then depending on what settings you use, it can hover around in that bottom left corner                                                                                                                      |
| 21:08      | on the Mac for as long as you like, or for example, until you interact with it.                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:14      | And this is one of the things I love, because a number of times I am talking to somebody                                                                                                                         |
| 21:19      | and they're like, I don't see this thing, like where is this thing that I need to click                                                                                                                          |
| 21:23      | on?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 21:24      | So what do I do?                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 21:25      | I take a screenshot.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21:26      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:27      | And probably come on, shift four for this, maybe I take a screenshot of the whole window                                                                                                                         |
| 21:30      | with space.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 21:31      | Yes, I've set CleanShot up to use the exact same keyboard shortcuts as the built-in screenshot                                                                                                                   |
| 21:38      | tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21:39      | And then, okay, so I've got my screenshot and it appears and it hovers in the lower left-hand                                                                                                                    |
| 21:43      | corner and I click on it.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21:45      | And that is where you get the options, because when you mouse over it to click on it, you                                                                                                                        |
| 21:51      | get sort of some icons appearing as an overlay.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 21:55      | So there's close, there's pinned, keep it around for a while.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21:59      | There's upload if you want to use it with the cloud upload service, and there's a pencil                                                                                                                         |
| 22:04      | in the bottom left.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 22:05      | In the middle there's also copy and delete, but we'll come back to those in a minute.                                                                                                                            |
| 22:07      | But if I click on the pencil, then I get a really nifty little built-in animation tool                                                                                                                           |
| 22:12      | with arrows.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 22:14      | There's like a blur something out, so you can just drag and it'll just pixelate whatever                                                                                                                         |
| 22:18      | is behind it.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22:19      | Great for information that you don't want to keep.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22:23      | You can even add more images on top.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 22:26      | Okay, so you can add screenshots and things like that.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:28      | And this little built-in tool is really, really useful.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 22:33      | Because you can also, you know, just not, you know, you don't have to then save the                                                                                                                              |
| 22:40      | image.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 22:41      | When you're done, you can save the image.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22:44      | There's also a drag me option at the bottom, but the done just puts it back as that little                                                                                                                       |
| 22:49      | floating icon in the bottom left.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 22:52      | And also there's a share icon, pin and copy as well, so that you can just keep those.                                                                                                                            |
| 22:57      | And a number of times I use this, and then, you know, I've done everything that I need                                                                                                                           |
| 23:03      | to do, and then I can just delete the image and I'm done.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 23:08      | It's huge.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 23:09      | And that for me has been a humongous time saver, like humongous.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:14      | And yeah, the other things that I've done, which definitely worth looking at, in Clean                                                                                                                           |
| 23:22      | Shots main general preferences, there is an after capture section where you can check                                                                                                                            |
| 23:30      | which options you want to have an after capture, and you can set them separately for screenshots                                                                                                                 |
| 23:34      | and recordings.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 23:36      | So if you occasionally do like a video recording of your desktop, like you can have that do                                                                                                                      |
| 23:40      | different things to what a screenshot does, which is very, very useful.                                                                                                                                          |
| 23:46      | And also I love the fact that I can hide my desktop icons while capturing, because every                                                                                                                         |
| 23:49      | so often I'll check a bunch of stuff on my desktop, and it will disappear after 24 hours.                                                                                                                        |
| 23:54      | But you know, I don't want it in my screenshots.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:56      | So the fact that I can customise this and just have them be hidden is really nice.                                                                                                                               |
| 24:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:02      | So there's so much to this app.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 24:04      | It reminds me of [[BetterTouchTool]] in the sense that it feels like it started as a screenshot                                                                                                                    |
| 24:10      | app, and the developer just went crazy with it, and just keeps adding things.                                                                                                                                    |
| 24:15      | I mean, one of the things they do is they make it really easy to have you replace the                                                                                                                            |
| 24:22      | built-in screenshot shortcuts that we were talking about before the break.                                                                                                                                       |
| 24:27      | So you have to do that in the keyboard settings, because they're all kind of on the system                                                                                                                       |
| 24:32      | level.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:33      | But it walks you through.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 24:34      | I do.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:35      | It's not difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 24:36      | And then you can have it take over, and you just get all those benefits.                                                                                                                                         |
| 24:39      | One of the things Rose was talking about that I do is I have it copy any screenshot to the                                                                                                                       |
| 24:44      | clipboard immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 24:45      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 24:46      | Yeah, same.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 24:47      | And then so that kind of allows me to avoid saving and dealing with files.                                                                                                                                       |
| 24:51      | So often those screenshots are just for me to email to someone or put it in a Slack or                                                                                                                           |
| 24:56      | whatever when I'm working with a developer or when Rose and I are planning the show.                                                                                                                             |
| 25:01      | And I just find that really nice and simple.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 25:05      | Another thing, I mean, it does OCR.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 25:07      | I mean, I didn't even know it did that.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:09      | So I started digging through the settings for today's recording.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 25:13      | You know, one of my favourite features is that it has the ability to hide all the icons on                                                                                                                        |
| 25:19      | your desktop.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:21      | And you combine that with very robust shortcut support.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 25:25      | So what I've done is I have attached a shortcut control F10 to toggle the desktop icons.                                                                                                                         |
| 25:33      | And we just got done talking about this a bit on Mac power users, and I released a YouTube                                                                                                                       |
| 25:36      | video on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 25:37      | So I'll put it in the links for the show today.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 25:39      | But when I set up to do screen casting, I changed the screen resolution, I hide a bunch                                                                                                                          |
| 25:45      | of stuff in the menu bar, and I hide the stuff on my desktop.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 25:49      | And all I'm doing is sending through Keyboard Maestro command, which is control F10, which                                                                                                                       |
| 25:55      | is going to clean shot and saying hide his icons, you know, hide everything on his desktop.                                                                                                                      |
| 26:02      | It just not, you know, it just takes a problem that would require intricate scripting and                                                                                                                        |
| 26:08      | you know, some kind of shenanigans.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 26:11      | And it just breaks it down to a single keyboard shortcut.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 26:15      | And that's what I love about clean shot.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:18      | Not only did they come up with the tools, they allowed you to build your own triggers                                                                                                                            |
| 26:21      | to trigger the tools.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:23      | And you know, you can automate the whole screen shotting process really, really deeply with                                                                                                                      |
| 26:29      | clean shot X.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:30      | I can't believe how much I resisted this app and how quickly I realised, man, that was                                                                                                                           |
| 26:35      | dumb.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:36      | I should have been using this the whole time.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 26:38      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 26:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:40      | Same.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 26:41      | And another thing that I want to mention that is built into clean shot, which I'm sure some                                                                                                                      |
| 26:45      | of you are going to go, wait, what this exists is there's a screenshot history.                                                                                                                                  |
| 26:51      | So some of you may be familiar with apps that support clipboard history.                                                                                                                                         |
| 26:56      | So for example, I use Alfred to manage my clipboard history, Keyboard Maestro also has                                                                                                                           |
| 27:00      | this built in, or essentially what you can do is if you've copied a number of things,                                                                                                                            |
| 27:04      | you can go back to a previous thing that you've copied to repaste it.                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:09      | Well, clean shot also has a screenshot history built in.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:14      | And this is accessible from the menu bar.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 27:15      | If you go to the menu bar icon and you click it, and then you click to, you know, screenshot                                                                                                                     |
| 27:20      | history, I believe it's called capture history.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 27:23      | Sorry.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 27:24      | It's capture history.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 27:25      | Then it'll show you all of the things.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 27:27      | And then there's also, you can filter for just screenshots, just videos or just animated                                                                                                                         |
| 27:32      | images.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 27:33      | And so you can, you can also customise in screenshot how long you want to keep stuff                                                                                                                             |
| 27:37      | for.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 27:38      | I actually have stuff set to three days, just because, you know, I'll go through phases                                                                                                                          |
| 27:44      | of taking lots of screenshots, and I won't take any screenshots as tall.                                                                                                                                         |
| 27:48      | But this can be very, very useful, especially if you're somebody who doesn't want to keep                                                                                                                        |
| 27:53      | the images when you are, when you, when you save your screenshots or when you take your                                                                                                                          |
| 28:00      | screenshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 28:01      | And if by default you don't keep your images, I definitely recommend turning on that or                                                                                                                          |
| 28:05      | increasing your capture history, because it will definitely make your life a little bit                                                                                                                          |
| 28:10      | easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 28:11      | But yeah, it is such a useful tool.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:13      | So I have to recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 28:15      | It is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 28:17      | And also makes it nice and easy to, you know, you can turn off the sounds that happen when                                                                                                                       |
| 28:23      | you take a screenshot.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 28:25      | And I don't, I don't know if you can do that with the Mac OS built in screenshot app.                                                                                                                            |
| 28:29      | I don't feel like you can, but I like the fact that I don't have to have it enabled on, particularly                                                                                                             |
| 28:35      | my work machine, because it's my work machine and I'm in the office and then there's this                                                                                                                        |
| 28:38      | loud shutter sound and everyone sort of turns around the looks and it's like, what are you                                                                                                                       |
| 28:43      | taking pictures off?                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 28:44      | It's like, I'm not, I just took a screenshot.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28:46      | But yes, I have that turned off now, of course, on my work machine.                                                                                                                                              |
| 28:52      | So yeah, I have to have to recommend clean shot, go play with all of the features and                                                                                                                            |
| 28:57      | then forget about them and then go back like a week later and play with everything again.                                                                                                                        |
| 29:02      | It's definitely what I recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 29:03      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:04      | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:05      | One last cute little feature that I love is that you can have it, because usually when                                                                                                                           |
| 29:08      | you take it with the crosshair and you take a picture of a window and there's a, and there's                                                                                                                     |
| 29:14      | a desktop behind it, right, you get, you get a little bit of the desktop.                                                                                                                                        |
| 29:18      | If you want, you can have it take that and remove the desktop and just make it transparent.                                                                                                                      |
| 29:22      | I mean, just like so many nice little touches so you can really kind of dial this process                                                                                                                        |
| 29:27      | in.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 29:28      | I guess we're saying go check out screenshot or clean shot X if you want, if you do a lot                                                                                                                        |
| 29:32      | of screenshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 29:33      | I often wonder, is that just like a podcaster, like blogger thing that we take so many screenshots                                                                                                               |
| 29:39      | or are people out in the world taking a lot of screenshots too?                                                                                                                                                  |
| 29:43      | I was about to say, I feel like a lot of people take a lot of screenshots and I realised that                                                                                                                    |
| 29:46      | my day job is developers and testers.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 29:48      | So the people I interact with most of the time are people going, this doesn't work and                                                                                                                           |
| 29:53      | somebody sending a different image back going, but it does work and so that, that's possibly                                                                                                                     |
| 29:58      | a little bias, but I do know my parents use screenshots quite a bit, especially my dad                                                                                                                           |
| 30:03      | will take a screenshot and send it to me and say, what is this, which, you know, isn't                                                                                                                           |
| 30:09      | always the most helpful thing because he's usually forgetting to tell me the name of                                                                                                                             |
| 30:14      | the app that he's in, which is something I've never heard of, but at the very least I've                                                                                                                         |
| 30:17      | got a picture so I can, I can take a guess of what it might be.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:21      | And I, I can tell you that like we had, since we last recorded Rose, the car failed, our,                                                                                                                        |
| 30:26      | our, our nice car that we, it's all paid for gave up the ghost.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 30:33      | So we had to get a new car and I negotiated the deal largely over the telephone with the                                                                                                                         |
| 30:37      | dealerships and they were sending me images all the time and I was screenshotting and                                                                                                                            |
| 30:42      | sending them stuff back and it reminded me that, yeah, people who don't make their living                                                                                                                        |
| 30:48      | doing stuff with the internet actually take screenshots too.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:51      | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 30:52      | And my kids do it a lot too.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 30:54      | Like for school stuff, they're always taking screenshots.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 30:57      | So yeah, if you're out there and you take more than a few screenshots a month, you, you                                                                                                                          |
| 31:01      | probably owe it to yourself to install Clean Shot X.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:04      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31:06      | I have to say actually one thing I realised the other day when I was talking to my mom                                                                                                                           |
| 31:09      | is that, you know, sometimes on a website you can't copy the images like they've got                                                                                                                             |
| 31:12      | it set up so that you can't like right click on an image to copy it or whatever.                                                                                                                                 |
| 31:17      | And, you know, because, you know, the people who are creating these websites like, yeah,                                                                                                                         |
| 31:22      | we don't want people copying our images, that's not going to happen.                                                                                                                                             |
| 31:26      | So my mom works around this by just taking a screenshot, which, you know, completely                                                                                                                             |
| 31:31      | defeats their aim.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 31:33      | And so there we go.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31:35      | It's so dumb.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:36      | You know, I don't know how you do that.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 31:37      | How do you not have people take shots?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 31:39      | Everybody figures that out.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:40      | All right, Rose, but there's more to it than just screenshots.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 31:44      | We talked at the top of the show that there's different media types that involve images                                                                                                                          |
| 31:47      | because can we use automation to sort that mess out for us?                                                                                                                                                      |
| 31:51      | Yeah, we can.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 31:53      | So one of the things I've done and I used a clean shot for this because it exposes all                                                                                                                           |
| 31:58      | the settings that you can change on the Mac screenshots app without having to dig through                                                                                                                        |
| 32:03      | the terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 32:04      | So I've changed the name of all of my screenshots and screen recordings and I've saved where                                                                                                                     |
| 32:08      | they get saved when I choose to save them so that they go into my downloads folder because                                                                                                                       |
| 32:13      | [[Hazel]] watches my downloads folder.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 32:15      | [[Hazel]] does also watch my desktop, but I don't like having loads of screenshots there.                                                                                                                            |
| 32:18      | I find the downloads folder is great.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 32:20      | It's in my doc and click on it.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 32:21      | I can see like the most recent thing and drag it off wherever if I have saved something.                                                                                                                         |
| 32:26      | Can I interrupt there?                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 32:28      | Let me just ask.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 32:29      | Do you have [[Hazel]] sorting into subfolders in the download folder?                                                                                                                                                |
| 32:33      | What's it doing in the download folder?                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32:35      | So [[Hazel]]'s primary job in my downloads folder is to delete things because if it's in my                                                                                                                          |
| 32:42      | downloads folder, I probably don't need to keep it.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 32:46      | And so it goes into my downloads folder.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 32:49      | My downloads folder is in my doc so I can easily drag stuff to other locations when they need                                                                                                                    |
| 32:53      | to be kept.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 32:54      | [[Hazel]] will watch for things that need to be kept and move them to the right place because                                                                                                                        |
| 32:59      | [[Hazel]] knows about a lot of this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 33:01      | If I download like a pay slip, obviously that's going to go get saved.                                                                                                                                           |
| 33:03      | Fortunately, those are PDFs and not images so we don't need to talk about those today.                                                                                                                           |
| 33:08      | But basically [[Hazel]] will keep screen recordings around for a week and screenshots around for                                                                                                                     |
| 33:15      | two days in general.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 33:18      | There are some like I've settled on this because two days I found is like enough time that                                                                                                                       |
| 33:23      | if I've taken a screenshot or something and then I realise and I think, okay, I'll keep                                                                                                                          |
| 33:29      | it because I might need it.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 33:31      | It's not usually the same day that I need it.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 33:33      | It's when I'm following up on something the next day that it's like, ah, yeah, and you                                                                                                                           |
| 33:36      | need that.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 33:37      | Obviously, I could go get it out with a clean shot history, but if I made the point of actually                                                                                                                  |
| 33:40      | clicking the save button, I figured keeping it around for two days is good and screen                                                                                                                            |
| 33:44      | recordings, a week seemed reasonable.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 33:47      | I don't take many screen recordings, but yeah, so those stick around for a week and then                                                                                                                         |
| 33:53      | they disappear unless they get renamed in some way, which rarely happens, but if I rename                                                                                                                        |
| 34:02      | them to something else, then they will probably get moved as part of that.                                                                                                                                       |
| 34:08      | But yeah, so I start with a [[Hazel]] in the downloads folder to just get rid of the things.                                                                                                                         |
| 34:16      | Usually screenshots and so on don't need to be kept for me.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 34:18      | I don't know about you, but all the time, unless I'm doing something like writing an                                                                                                                             |
| 34:23      | update for take control, I'm not going to keep my screenshots.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34:26      | And if I am writing an update for take control of shortcuts, then I'm going to move those                                                                                                                        |
| 34:30      | screenshots when I've taken them, which is when [[Hazel]] will then hop in and rename things                                                                                                                         |
| 34:35      | for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34:37      | No, I'm the same way.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34:38      | They don't last long for me.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 34:41      | Quite often they get incorporated into some other sort of media or they get published                                                                                                                            |
| 34:45      | and I don't need them.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34:48      | I do have an occasional need.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 34:52      | My rule requires the word screenshot to delete it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 34:56      | And like when I was doing the car thing, I would go in there and change their name so                                                                                                                            |
| 35:01      | they didn't get deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35:03      | You also have the ability with screenshot to have it prompt you for a name every time,                                                                                                                           |
| 35:08      | but I don't do that because I rename them very infrequently and I don't want to have                                                                                                                             |
| 35:12      | to do it every time just because I do it once in a while.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 35:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 35:17      | And I think that's the thing, isn't it?                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 35:21      | You need easy ways to handle this stuff as is appropriate for you and the thing that                                                                                                                             |
| 35:27      | you're doing.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 35:28      | So one of the things I will do is when I am writing say an update to take control of shortcuts,                                                                                                                  |
| 35:34      | I put a shortcut in my doc.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 35:38      | And then when I take a screenshot and I click save, or if I don't click save, I can just                                                                                                                         |
| 35:42      | grab it from the little preview icon, I can drag it onto the shortcut and then that shortcut                                                                                                                     |
| 35:47      | will ask me what I want to name it to, make sure it gets lowercase and everything and                                                                                                                            |
| 35:53      | no spaces in the name, and stick it in the right folder for me.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 35:56      | And so it doesn't matter where I grab that screenshot from, it's going to move that to                                                                                                                           |
| 36:00      | the right location.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 36:02      | And it's just one of those things where I don't usually keep stuff in my doc for things                                                                                                                          |
| 36:07      | like that, but for the couple of weeks or a month or so that I'm working on that, I'm                                                                                                                            |
| 36:12      | very happy to take up a doc space for a particular shortcut so that I can easily rename these                                                                                                                    |
| 36:17      | files and then it can go away again.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 36:19      | But those shortcuts will prompt me to do the renaming.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36:23      | It's also available under the right click quick actions option.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 36:27      | But it depends on how I'm interacting with something as to what I want to do.                                                                                                                                    |
| 36:32      | But yeah, I find it's very like having a good basic file name is not just critical for image                                                                                                                     |
| 36:41      | automation, it feels like it's a really basic foundation stone for a lot of automation.                                                                                                                          |
| 36:47      | And you know, sometimes you need something to name something right, which is where the                                                                                                                           |
| 36:50      | OCR built into a screenshot could happen.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 36:53      | But maybe you can also just start by giving it the name of whatever it is that makes sense,                                                                                                                      |

| 37:03      | devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 37:05      | I promise we're going to stop talking about clean shots soon, but you know, just kind of                                                                                                                         |
| 37:09      | finish these threads.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 37:10      | I have another app that I use in a similar fashion.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 37:13      | It's called Drop Zone.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:15      | In Drop Zone, it also is what I would consider to be an automation tool.                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:20      | It goes in your menu bar.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 37:21      | It's a little arrow.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 37:22      | And you can have on there basically a saved clipboard.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 37:26      | So as an example, when I make the videos for the MacSparky Labs, the intro and outro                                                                                                                            |
| 37:31      | are 4K images that I animate on top of.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 37:34      | I've got those in Drop Zone and then there's like a little music hit and all those are there                                                                                                                     |
| 37:40      | and I can drag them into like ScreenFlow or final cut or wherever I'm working when I                                                                                                                            |
| 37:44      | need them.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 37:45      | So they're just always in my menu bar, but there's also these automation routines you                                                                                                                            |
| 37:49      | can build where, and they're very, they're very rudimentary, but this stuff is really                                                                                                                            |
| 37:54      | helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 37:55      | Like I've got one for what I call the action folder, which is where [[Hazel]] does most work                                                                                                                         |
| 37:59      | for me as opposed to download.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:01      | It does stuff in downloads, but action is where the action is, right?                                                                                                                                            |
| 38:04      | And so if I take a screenshot or any image and I just drag it onto Drop Zone and put                                                                                                                             |
| 38:13      | it on the action folder, then that's like the secondary backup where it goes, where                                                                                                                              |
| 38:19      | it doesn't get auto-deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 38:22      | So I copy, I'm sorry, I moved to action folder because of wherever it's coming from, I just                                                                                                                      |
| 38:26      | want to put it there, but then there's somewhere I copy to it.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 38:29      | Like if I do want it on my desktop, I do occasionally use the desktop as some workspace, it copies                                                                                                               |
| 38:34      | the file there.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 38:35      | It doesn't move it there.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 38:36      | And these are little switches you can throw inside Drop Zone, but when you combine those                                                                                                                         |
| 38:40      | two apps together, it actually is quite automation adjacent, if not full-on automation.                                                                                                                          |
| 38:47      | Oh, definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 38:49      | And you know, Drop Zone is, it's one of those tools where it's definitely an automation                                                                                                                          |
| 38:55      | app.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 38:56      | So one of the things I have in Drop Zone, not for images, I'll grant you, but related                                                                                                                            |
| 38:59      | to the downloads folder is install application.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:02      | So I can drag any application that I've downloaded from my downloads folder to the install and                                                                                                                   |
| 39:06      | it'll just go ahead and do it and get rid of the original file.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:09      | And there, it's definitely a useful automation tool.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 39:13      | I feel like it's also a very friendly automation tool for people who are not that tech savvy.                                                                                                                    |
| 39:18      | You know, that doesn't mean to say that you can't be tech savvy to use it.                                                                                                                                       |
| 39:22      | I use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:23      | So, you know, I happily write my own scripts for it, but I wouldn't expect most people                                                                                                                           |
| 39:26      | to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 39:28      | But the fact that you can see what you're doing, so you pick something up and you drag                                                                                                                           |
| 39:32      | it to the Drop Zone, you know, icon in the menu bar and then you drop it on the thing                                                                                                                            |
| 39:37      | and you see what's happening, there's progress bars and things like that.                                                                                                                                        |
| 39:41      | It's the sort of thing that makes people who are a little bit wary of some of these                                                                                                                              |
| 39:44      | automations a lot more comfortable because you can see what's happening and you're very                                                                                                                          |
| 39:48      | much in control and stuff isn't magically happening in the background.                                                                                                                                           |
| 39:53      | So yeah, don't forget, you can also put shortcuts in Drop Zone.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 39:56      | So you can drag things onto the Drop Zone where there's a shortcut that runs, which                                                                                                                              |
| 40:01      | is yet another way I do the take control of shortcuts renaming.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:05      | And I do that, so yeah, you know, all of the ways to do something because whatever way                                                                                                                           |
| 40:11      | I've set up previously is not necessarily the way, my brain is good, choose to do in                                                                                                                             |
| 40:14      | that moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 40:15      | And especially when you're doing something, you know, I find with images, David, I go                                                                                                                            |
| 40:20      | through phases where I'll be doing a lot of something for a bit, it could be a couple                                                                                                                            |
| 40:24      | of weeks, it could be a month, and then I won't touch it again for, you know, 10 months,                                                                                                                         |
| 40:29      | and then I'll be back and I'll need to do the same thing again.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 40:31      | So for that sort of thing, I have a lot of automations available or I have the same automation                                                                                                                   |
| 40:36      | available in a lot of places, I should say, just because that way I don't have to remember                                                                                                                       |
| 40:41      | whatever workflow I was using before, I can use whatever workflow is most comfortable for                                                                                                                        |
| 40:45      | me in that moment and get the same results.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 40:49      | And that's one of the beauties about automation is that it's, once you've created the logic                                                                                                                      |
| 40:54      | of it or the workflow of it, it's easy to put it in a lot of different places.                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:01      | You've heard me talk about how important it is to have a VPN to protect your online                                                                                                                              |
| 41:04      | privacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:05      | But choosing a VPN you trust is equally as important.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 41:07      | There are tons of VPN providers out there, but there's a reason I use ExpressVPN and                                                                                                                             |
| 41:11      | why we have them as a sponsor.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41:12      | They're really good.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 41:13      | Here's why.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 41:14      | Number one, ExpressVPN doesn't log your activity online.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 41:18      | Lots of VPNs may make money by selling your data to advertisers, but ExpressVPN doesn't                                                                                                                          |

| 41:54      | I've been using ExpressVPN for years and it's really easy to use, whether it's because                                                                                                                           |

| 42:15      | Well, you should use ExpressVPN if you need to check out some content that's not available                                                                                                                       |

| 42:44      | Our thanks to ExpressVPN for their support of the show and all of Relay FM.                                                                                                                                     |
| 42:48      | All right, Rose, let's talk a little bit about automation we're applying to images                                                                                                                               |
| 42:53      | that are not screenshots and just kind of the day-to-day stuff.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 42:58      | For me, I feel like the Shortcuts app, this is one thing Shortcuts is really good at.                                                                                                                            |
| 43:04      | We hear from people asking, which automation platform should I learn and my answer is all                                                                                                                        |
| 43:08      | of them because that's my thing.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:11      | But you don't need to master all of them, but you should be at least familiar with what                                                                                                                          |
| 43:14      | they're good at.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 43:15      | And to me, Shortcuts really simplified doing automation stuff on your photos for a couple                                                                                                                        |
| 43:24      | of reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 43:25      | The first is Apple included a decent set of photo tools in Shortcuts and especially manipulation                                                                                                                 |
| 43:32      | of files, like photo files, conversion of files, like kind of the basics that you need.                                                                                                                          |
| 43:38      | And I feel like the third-party app developers, the photo app developers that have jumped                                                                                                                        |
| 43:43      | on the Shortcuts bandwagon have brought some really impressive additional steps in that                                                                                                                          |
| 43:49      | you can do with Shortcuts and photos.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 43:52      | Definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 43:53      | So, for this, I definitely focused on looking at Shortcuts on the Mac because we all know                                                                                                                        |
| 43:59      | that Shortcuts on iOS has got a lot of powerful tools in it, but when it comes to the Mac,                                                                                                                       |
| 44:05      | I don't know about you, David, but I don't have all of my pictures in photos because                                                                                                                             |
| 44:11      | I have a lot of pictures in other places because they're not photos, they're not part of my                                                                                                                      |

| 44:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 44:16      | On iOS, it's easy.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 44:17      | You take a photo and it goes into your photos library by default.                                                                                                                                                |
| 44:20      | And so, you know, I always want more options.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 44:23      | And so I was going through and looking at, I have to say, Pixelmator Pro definitely gets,                                                                                                                        |
| 44:28      | you know, a couple of checkmarks and a gold star in the Shortcuts actions category because                                                                                                                       |
| 44:34      | they have all of the Shortcuts actions, you know, they've got inverting images, masking                                                                                                                          |
| 44:38      | images, improving the lighting of images and videos, improving human saturation, cropping,                                                                                                                       |
| 44:44      | getting a person mask for a photo, and all sorts of things.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 44:47      | And bearing in mind, this can be combined with all of the photos actions, which, you                                                                                                                             |
| 44:51      | know, on Mac, there aren't as many.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 44:54      | Unfortunately, there's selecting photos from your photo library, you know, getting the                                                                                                                           |
| 44:59      | last import, getting the latest live photos and so on.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:03      | But, you know, when you combine that with under the category for media, there are image                                                                                                                          |
| 45:10      | editing options, which aren't photos specific, they're image editing, so there's converting                                                                                                                      |
| 45:14      | images, filtering images, masking, or relaying, or relaying text on images, resizing and all                                                                                                                     |
| 45:20      | of that, you'll find that you can actually just point and click to drag a bunch of these                                                                                                                         |
| 45:25      | things together very quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 45:29      | And, you know, especially something like combining images, I often find that I need, like, I'll                                                                                                                  |
| 45:35      | take like two or three images, and I need to stitch them together in some way because,                                                                                                                           |
| 45:40      | you know, I want to send them to somebody, but if I send, you know, if I send in messages                                                                                                                        |
| 45:45      | to you right now, David, four pictures, they're going to appear as a little stack, and if                                                                                                                        |
| 45:49      | I want to send you pictures like photos, that's great.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 45:53      | But sometimes I want something that's a bit more like I've put something together with                                                                                                                           |
| 45:57      | like an Instagram layout, which actually there is a layout app for Instagram that will let                                                                                                                       |
| 46:02      | you do some of the fun stuff like this.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 46:05      | But honestly, I also just use shortcuts for this most of the time because I can say, hey,                                                                                                                        |
| 46:10      | combine the images that I've selected in a grid and share, and that's it.                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:15      | And that can be very nice when you want to share something that's sort of a bit like                                                                                                                             |
| 46:19      | a scrapbook type effect with somebody, and, you know, you can add some text over the top                                                                                                                         |
| 46:24      | or put an image on top or whatever it is that you want to do before you then send it on.                                                                                                                         |
| 46:31      | It's quite nice to be able to do some of the effects or similar things like you get in                                                                                                                           |
| 46:36      | many social media apps without having to use social media apps because a lot of them downgrade                                                                                                                   |
| 46:40      | the quality and so on.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 46:42      | So yeah, this is a nice way to keep everything at the highest resolution.                                                                                                                                        |
| 46:46      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 46:47      | You covered a lot there.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 47:17      | the photo apps, they're one of the best at that.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 47:19      | And as Apple has incorporated machine learning in all its platform on the Apple Silicon chips,                                                                                                                   |
| 47:26      | not just the Mac, but definitely on the Mac, pixel meter has always seemed to me like one                                                                                                                        |
| 47:32      | of the companies that's leading the way on taking advantage of that extra silicon.                                                                                                                               |
| 47:36      | And so there's a bunch of stuff you can do in pixel meter pro to a photo that normally                                                                                                                           |
| 47:43      | you wouldn't be able to do to a photo like you can resize it.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 47:48      | But when you built, you can build it up in size, but it'll auto fix it.                                                                                                                                          |
| 47:53      | Like you remember an old TV shows where they would have like the CIA and they'd have a                                                                                                                           |
| 47:57      | really pixelated photo and they'd push a magic button and suddenly the photo was clear.                                                                                                                          |
| 48:01      | Well, that's really not possible.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 48:04      | I mean, you can't bring resolution to an image that doesn't have it.                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:09      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:10      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:11      | Well, at least historically, it wasn't possible and the pixel meter is using machine learning                                                                                                                    |
| 48:15      | to actually do that.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 48:16      | Like I had some old, cool Star Wars wallpapers I like that were like back in the day where                                                                                                                       |
| 48:22      | like 1080 was as big of a resolution as you would ever have on a screen.                                                                                                                                         |
| 48:27      | And I wanted to use them and they were simple graphics, but I wanted to use them on my,                                                                                                                          |
| 48:31      | you know, my big 6K monitor.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 48:34      | And I just put in pixel meter and had it blow it up and it smoothed everything out for me.                                                                                                                       |
| 48:38      | So it does all this cool stuff, which is a form of image automation, really, but not                                                                                                                             |
| 48:45      | only can you do that.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 48:48      | So I'll call pixel meter another automation adjacent app, but you can call all that stuff                                                                                                                        |
| 48:54      | in shortcuts and Rose just mentioned it in passing, but there on the Mac, if you have                                                                                                                            |
| 49:00      | pixel meter Pro and solve, you've got an image editing suite built into shortcuts now.                                                                                                                           |
| 49:06      | And yeah, they took not only did they do like the exotic stuff, but they also did stuff                                                                                                                          |
| 49:11      | like like de-noising and stuff like that, but they also took the built in actions and                                                                                                                            |
| 49:16      | made them better.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 49:18      | Like the conversion action, for instance, I think the pixel meter one does a better                                                                                                                              |
| 49:21      | job than the Apple one does.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 49:23      | And like you can tell there's a bunch of people that, you know, wake up in the morning thinking                                                                                                                  |
| 49:28      | about images and go to bed thinking about images and they made shortcuts out of their                                                                                                                            |
| 49:32      | app and it's really impressive.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 49:35      | And if you want to do image automation on your Mac, you probably should buy pixel meter                                                                                                                          |
| 49:40      | Pro.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49:42      | It's not a small purchase, but it's a lot less than a subscription to the Adobe suite.                                                                                                                           |
| 49:47      | It is.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 49:48      | So what, I mean, if you only need the Adobe suite for a month, then you could probably                                                                                                                           |
| 49:51      | get at least Photoshop for, I think it's $9.99 for the month, but pixel meter is a one time                                                                                                                      |
| 49:57      | purchase of $50 and it does go on sale every so often.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:00      | So definitely worth considering if you need to do image editing of any kind.                                                                                                                                     |
| 50:05      | And I have to say, you know, I really like it as an image editing app.                                                                                                                                           |
| 50:11      | And the fact that it has all the shortcut support as well is, you know, just even better.                                                                                                                        |
| 50:16      | Something else or another app I want to mention, because this is perhaps a little more niche,                                                                                                                    |
| 50:23      | but if you've ever taken a picture and you want to turn it into like an icon, almost                                                                                                                             |
| 50:26      | like an app icon type thing, then there is an app on the Mac that I've used for this                                                                                                                             |
| 50:32      | called image to icon two being the number two, that has shortcut support.                                                                                                                                        |
| 50:37      | So you can open, it is not great shortcut support, you can open it with a certain file                                                                                                                           |
| 50:42      | or you can set a custom icon as the icon of a file or a folder, but I have to say, using                                                                                                                         |
| 50:49      | that one to set something as the icon of a file or a folder is one of the many ways                                                                                                                              |
| 50:53      | that I do actually use images that I've taken or created in some way, because I like to                                                                                                                          |
| 50:59      | be able to easily identify things, and especially when you've got like three or four folders                                                                                                                     |
| 51:02      | in your doc next to the recycling bin or the trash, it's really useful to be able to accurately                                                                                                                  |
| 51:08      | identify them.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 51:10      | And what better way than using a picture that you've taken, you know, by yourself or create                                                                                                                      |

| 51:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 51:16      | It allows you to convert anything into an icon.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 51:27      | It's primarily the ones that live or get added to my doc so that I can, you know, see them                                                                                                                       |
| 51:33      | easily.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 51:34      | But I do, it depends on the folder, if the folders go be around for a while, like the                                                                                                                            |
| 51:39      | automators folder that I have has the automators icon on it and things like that.                                                                                                                                |
| 51:45      | So you know, folders that I'm going to keep, I will customise the image of, folders that                                                                                                                         |
| 51:50      | are maybe, it's not so much that I'm not going to keep them, but I'm going to interact                                                                                                                           |
| 51:56      | with them less.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 51:57      | Those I, I'll just, you know, I'll just leave as the default folder.                                                                                                                                             |
| 52:02      | And it's also quite handy because this way if I open the recycling bin trash, then I                                                                                                                             |
| 52:07      | can see at a glance, oh, this one's got a pretty colourful icon.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:10      | Did I mean to delete that?                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 52:13      | And so that can be quite a good useful sanity check for that sort of thing when it's needed.                                                                                                                     |
| 52:18      | Which is honestly not all that often because most of the time things get deleted, it's                                                                                                                           |
| 52:21      | [[Hazel]] and [[Hazel]] doesn't delete stuff that I tell it to keep.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:25      | You know, I'm, I tried to be smart about these things, but at the same time, you know, it's                                                                                                                      |
| 52:29      | always good to double check.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:30      | What about you?                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 52:31      | I do it occasionally.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 52:33      | I used to do a lot and I've got out of the habit over the years and listening to you                                                                                                                             |
| 52:37      | makes me want to do it more.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 52:40      | And the way I used to always do it, so you have to tell me if there's a better way to                                                                                                                            |
| 52:43      | do it these days, but I used to just do it with the inspector.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 52:45      | If you go into the inspector for a folder, you can drag an icon image over the image                                                                                                                             |
| 52:50      | of the folder and then boom, you've got a re iconised folder.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 52:56      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 52:57      | That's how, yeah, that's why I always did it.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 52:58      | So that's one way of doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 52:59      | I tend-to-end up using shortcuts because image to icon explicitly has an action for this                                                                                                                         |
| 53:06      | where you can set the custom icon of a file or folder.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 53:10      | And so you choose whatever it is and you can also like customise how the image is used.                                                                                                                          |
| 53:19      | So you don't actually have to like open the app to do this.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 53:22      | You can just be like, okay, here's an image, set it as like a USB drive type thing or a                                                                                                                          |
| 53:30      | big server style app or an iMessage style thing or an iOS style icon and then stick it                                                                                                                           |
| 53:36      | on this file or folder and that's it and done.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 53:39      | So yeah, I really like that.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 53:42      | You know, I have it pop up with a menu so that I can choose like, okay, do I want this                                                                                                                           |
| 53:46      | is like the image in the centre of a folder, an engraved image in a folder, which is where                                                                                                                       |
| 53:52      | it kind of takes it and well, it's like it embosses and debosses parts.                                                                                                                                          |
| 53:58      | I also have some documents and then I tend to have the iOS app icon.                                                                                                                                             |
| 54:04      | I should probably branch out and explore some of these other options because I'm pretty                                                                                                                          |
| 54:07      | certain Polaroid wasn't there last time I looked.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:09      | There's also NES and Game Boy cartridges.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:13      | So you know, if you if you want to use a have a cartridge for Nintendo Entertainment System                                                                                                                      |
| 54:18      | with an image on as one of your folder icons, you can do that and that's pretty cool to                                                                                                                          |
| 54:24      | me.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 54:25      | So and the files called or the app is called image to icon with no space, right?                                                                                                                                 |
| 54:29      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 54:30      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:31      | And I put that in the show notes.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 54:32      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:33      | Let the record reflect.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 54:34      | I just bought an app.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:35      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:36      | Excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 54:37      | I'm pleased to hear that.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 54:38      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54:39      | To get the pro features, it's 999 easy.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 54:43      | That's an easy one.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 54:44      | Definitely.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 54:45      | There's some other shortcut stuff I'm doing with images is the, you know, just basic resize.                                                                                                                     |
| 54:53      | Like I a lot of times I want to upload images to forums like even the Mac Power users forum.                                                                                                                     |
| 54:59      | If you're doing it on your Mac, you can resize it easily.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 55:03      | In fact, it does it for you.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 55:05      | I find that when I'm pulling images off my phone, sometimes it doesn't.                                                                                                                                          |
| 55:09      | And so I just have a quick resize action I run.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:14      | And on the iPhone version, I'm just using the built in resizer that is comes with shortcuts.                                                                                                                     |
| 55:19      | I find that really easy.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 55:22      | I used to have one, I used to have a whole series of shortcuts based on screenshots where                                                                                                                        |
| 55:28      | you could go through and auto delete them.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 55:30      | But that's largely not as big of an issue because most of my screenshots are taken on                                                                                                                            |
| 55:34      | the Mac and we've already talked about how clean shot X solves that.                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:38      | But occasionally, you know, I do run those still and it's just a filter that goes and                                                                                                                            |
| 55:42      | looks for all screenshots and let's use select multiple and delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| 55:47      | Not rocket science, but automation nonetheless.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 55:50      | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 55:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 55:52      | So I have another way that I use shortcuts, David, because we mentioned earlier reference                                                                                                                        |
| 55:57      | images and reference images are great.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 56:00      | I love taking reference images, but a lot of the times I don't necessarily actually want                                                                                                                         |
| 56:03      | to keep those images or I don't necessarily want to put them into particular folders.                                                                                                                            |
| 56:08      | And so I usually use a shortcut to take these reference images and save them straight to                                                                                                                         |
| 56:12      | a specific album or even, I don't even save them to an album some of the time.                                                                                                                                   |
| 56:17      | I just stick them in this great little app called [[Yoink]]. And [[Yoink]], there's two separate versions                                                                                                                        |
| 56:22      | of [[Yoink]].                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 56:23      | There's one on the Mac and then there's one on iOS and the iOS and iPad one is, you know,                                                                                                                        |
| 56:28      | a shelf app and on Mac OS is a floating shelf that appears in the bottom left very conveniently                                                                                                                  |
| 56:33      | located right next to where my clean shot image preview hovers so I can quickly drag                                                                                                                             |
| 56:41      | something into [[Yoink]] if I need to keep it around for a little while.                                                                                                                                             |
| 56:44      | And yeah, this is one of my favourite little tricks of like, I don't need to save this                                                                                                                            |
| 56:50      | image.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 56:51      | So I'll stick it in [[Yoink]] because, you know, if I'm taking a reference image, for example,                                                                                                                       |
| 56:55      | how big is my door, then I can use that.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 56:59      | And when I'm done with that at the hardware store and I'm like, okay, I've seen it, I                                                                                                                            |
| 57:03      | bought a hook, I can just delete the image.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 57:05      | And you know, that's it.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 57:08      | It's done and it's gone.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 57:09      | And I don't have to actually go into the Photos app and delete it.                                                                                                                                               |
| 57:11      | And when I'm browsing through photos later, I don't get random pictures of doors with                                                                                                                            |
| 57:15      | tape measures next to them, which, you know, it's one of those things, there are many worse                                                                                                                      |
| 57:20      | things that you could find browsing through your photo library, I am very sure of that.                                                                                                                          |
| 57:25      | But at the same time, when you're browsing through, you know, like holiday pictures that                                                                                                                         |
| 57:29      | you've taken, and then you see like the picture of the bus timetable, you know, do you want                                                                                                                      |
| 57:34      | to keep the picture of the bus timetable?                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 57:35      | No, you just needed it while you were there.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 57:37      | So I'd stick, you know, temporary working items into [[Yoink]].                                                                                                                                                      |
| 57:41      | You know, you gave me a great idea Rose, I need to make an automation.                                                                                                                                           |
| 57:45      | Walk me through this, how you would do it.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:47      | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 57:48      | I, as part of my day one journal, I every day have a journal called Meditations and I subscribe                                                                                                                  |
| 57:56      | to Readwise, which is an excellent service that connects with my Amazon Kindles.                                                                                                                                 |
| 58:01      | And anything I highlight in my books I read will show up randomly, it's a spaced repetitious                                                                                                                     |
| 58:06      | system.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:07      | And so what I'll do on a daily basis is I go through Readwise on, usually on the iPad,                                                                                                                           |
| 58:13      | can I do it when I do my journal on the iPad?                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 58:16      | And I'll say, oh, you know, I'll just go through, there's 10 of them, I go through every day                                                                                                                     |
| 58:20      | and I'm like, oh, this is a good one, I want to think about this one.                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:23      | And you push the button, it saves it as a screenshot.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:27      | And then as I'm talking, I think I solved it for myself, but it saves it as a screenshot                                                                                                                         |
| 58:33      | and then I just import the screenshot in day one.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 58:36      | But then I've got all these images in my photo stream of little quotes because it formats                                                                                                                        |
| 58:43      | them very nicely.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 58:44      | But then I just got thinking, I bet that share sheet probably lets me send it straight                                                                                                                           |
| 58:48      | to day one.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 58:49      | I don't even need to be putting in photos at all.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 58:51      | Quite possibly.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 58:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:53      | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 58:54      | Let's say it doesn't.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:55      | Let's say it doesn't.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 58:56      | How would you solve it?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58:57      | Hmm.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 58:58      | Well, I mean, assuming it's in photos, what I would do is I would have a shortcut that                                                                                                                           |
| 59:01      | you can run that just grabs like the most recent photo and, you know, asks you to confirm                                                                                                                        |
| 59:08      | and then puts in a day one to delete different photos.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 59:13      | But you know, that's probably what I would do there because assuming that you can just                                                                                                                           |
| 59:19      | quickly, you know, maybe triple tap on the back of your iPhone or run, you know, use                                                                                                                             |
| 59:26      | a gesture, that's the one on the trackpad, on an iPad, then you can trigger that shortcut                                                                                                                        |
| 59:32      | very quickly and very easily and, you know, then, you know, save an image, save an image,                                                                                                                        |
| 59:39      | and then move the image, save an image, move the image, or you could have one action that                                                                                                                        |
| 59:43      | you run when you're done with saving and it asks you to just select the pictures and                                                                                                                             |
| 59:47      | move some over.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 59:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 59:49      | Yeah, it wasn't doing the day one thing, I just opened it up because it's like three                                                                                                                             |
| 59:52      | taps to get to the save to day one and it's one time to save it.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 59:55      | And it's like, it's funny, like as an automator, we go down these rabbit holes are like, well,                                                                                                                   |
| 01:00:00   | I don't want to tap it three times, I want to tap it once.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:03   | And then so the fact that I tap it once means that I need to write an automation and I need                                                                                                                      |
| 01:00:08   | to do library maintenance and it's just like getting back to the whole thing.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:00:11   | The best way to automate files is not to have them.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:14   | Then why don't I just tap three times and that, you know, it really takes like five                                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:20   | seconds to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:00:23   | And that's much less time than it would take to run a shortcut and definitely much less                                                                                                                          |
| 01:00:27   | time than it would take to create and debug one.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:00:30   | So yeah, I feel like, yeah, I am sometimes my own worst enemy when it comes to this stuff.                                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:37   | Well, I think it's one of those things as well where I'm sure some of the folks listening                                                                                                                        |
| 01:00:41   | will have had this experience before where you end up making your own worst enemy of                                                                                                                             |
| 01:00:47   | yourself, especially when it comes to something like image automation, because you have a bunch                                                                                                                  |
| 01:00:51   | of stuff backed up that you need to go back and deal with.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:00:55   | And so, you know, I have a couple of recommendations if it comes to something like that where you've                                                                                                             |
| 01:01:02   | got, you know, a lot of images to deal with.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:01:05   | You know, first of all, I would just do basic rough grouping of, like, this appears to be                                                                                                                        |
| 01:01:11   | the pictures that I took while I was on holiday such vacation in XYZ place.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:01:16   | Or these were all the pictures that I took of this.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:01:20   | And just do it visually, and then you can go through with your leftovers and see what                                                                                                                            |
| 01:01:25   | happens.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:01:26   | But I definitely recommend starting a little manual before you dive into the automation                                                                                                                          |

| 01:01:39   | can feel like drowning in an ocean of different apps and services.                                                                                                                                               |

| 01:01:52   | So, how do you know which apps are worth trying?                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 01:01:59   | The answer is Setup.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 01:02:47   | One of the things I love about Setup is realising that I have a bit of a hole in my workflow,                                                                                                                    |
| 01:02:51   | and it's not a big enough hole that I'd necessarily go and pay however much money                                                                                                                                |
| 01:02:56   | for for an app that I just want to try out, but the free trial doesn't really let you                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:00   | do a lot, but there's something in Setup that solves it perfectly.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:03:04   | And I found a number of these tools in various different ways on Setup, because they solve                                                                                                                       |

| 01:03:16   | interdependent things, TaskHeat, that's the one I go to to solve this problem, and I found                                                                                                                       |
| 01:03:22   | it on Setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:03:28   | So you should try Setup if you need to get some more apps, and you are probably using                                                                                                                            |
| 01:03:34   | some of these already.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:36   | We've mentioned Setup on the show a couple of times today, because there's a number                                                                                                                              |
| 01:03:39   | of great apps on there, and it's going to be cheaper to get Setup than to go and buy                                                                                                                             |
| 01:03:44   | every single app that we talk about here.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:46   | Setup makes sure to remove outdated tools to keep the collection up to date with the best                                                                                                                        |
| 01:03:49   | software around.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:50   | If you've got a complex task to solve, you can delve into the app collections, and for                                                                                                                           |
| 01:03:54   | peace of mind, every app is updated automatically with no annoying ads to distract you.                                                                                                                          |

| 01:04:18   | Our thanks to Setup for their support of the show and Relay FM.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:04:22   | All right, before the break, we were talking about automating, you know, library maintenance.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:04:30   | And you said, well, the first step is let's go through it manually a bit.                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:04:35   | But there are tools you can use to go through and do a better job with automation when you                                                                                                                       |
| 01:04:42   | want to go through and kind of like call the herd of your library.                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:04:46   | There's been a couple of apps over the years where they allow you to just swipe.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:04:50   | Like you can flip through them like one of those dating apps and, you know, you can swipe                                                                                                                        |
| 01:04:54   | to delete or swipe to keep, you know, but it's just getting rid of your images.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:05:00   | The problem with that I always find is that you don't know, because I think like a lot                                                                                                                           |
| 01:05:05   | of people when I'm at a family event and we've got a group of six people together, I'll take                                                                                                                     |
| 01:05:12   | like 10 pictures because I don't know which one, you know, my mother-in-law had her eyes                                                                                                                         |
| 01:05:17   | closed on her, the kid was looking the other direction or whatever.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:05:22   | So I would like to be able to pick from them, but just using one of those quick swipe apps                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:26   | doesn't really do it justice.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:05:28   | Well, I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:05:31   | And so the reason why I say it doesn't, it doesn't is because an app that I mentioned                                                                                                                            |
| 01:05:36   | briefly at the top of the show, Gemini by Mac Paul, actually does this.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:05:41   | So I mentioned it in the context of duplicates and it is great for finding, you know, like                                                                                                                       |
| 01:05:45   | this is an exact copy of that, but it's also great for going, hey, burst mode or, you know,                                                                                                                      |
| 01:05:51   | these pictures were taken within two minutes and it is very good for helping you find,                                                                                                                           |
| 01:05:56   | you know, the one where everybody's got their eyes open so that you can actually pick the                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:01   | right one there.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:06:02   | And I feel like that is always a good starting point.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:05   | You are so ahead of me Rose, that was exactly where it's going to go because you can get                                                                                                                         |
| 01:06:08   | Gemini's part of your set up subscription.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:06:11   | It sounds like I'm in the bag for set up because they're sponsoring the episode, but honestly                                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:14   | they're not.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:15   | In fact, I forgot they were the sponsor when I just brought that up.                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:06:18   | But either way, it really is way more powerful than the duplicate finder that Apple gives                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:24   | you because exactly what Rose said, it actually uses computer smarts to pick pictures for                                                                                                                        |
| 01:06:30   | you.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:06:31   | Generally, I find it does a pretty good job.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:33   | Yeah, it is very good at that.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:06:36   | And I have to say, you know, I, I find it to be a very useful tool for things like this.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:06:41   | And you may think that you've got a very well-created Photos Library and if you do congratulations,                                                                                                              |
| 01:06:47   | I'm very happy for you.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:06:48   | But for most of us, I think we'll find if we download this and to be clear, you don't                                                                                                                            |
| 01:06:52   | have to use set up for this.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:06:53   | You can just download the app and get it separately or use the free trial and, you know, give                                                                                                                    |
| 01:06:59   | the free trial ago, even if you think your Photos Library is perfectly curated and you                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:03   | may find some surprises in there that you want to go ahead and tidy up.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:07   | So yeah, I definitely look into it for that.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:10   | If you are the person with the disorganised library, this app is going to be a godsend                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:14   | to you because it will really help you try and make sense out of the chaos that is your                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:18   | library.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:07:19   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:07:20   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:21   | And, you know, that, that sort of thing is pretty good.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:23   | I have to say another thing that I'm going to recommend, which is not exactly an automation,                                                                                                                     |
| 01:07:29   | but it's worth looking at is in Photos, when you, you look at your library, if you instead                                                                                                                       |
| 01:07:35   | of doing looking at all Photos, you switch to the days view, then you'll find that it                                                                                                                            |
| 01:07:40   | actually hides a bunch of the things that you are perhaps less interested in.                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:07:46   | Only enough scrolling back, David, I have lots of pictures of food, including chocolate                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:51   | cake of various kinds.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:07:52   | I've been experimenting with a new chocolate brandy recipe recently, and then lots of pictures                                                                                                                   |
| 01:07:57   | of gardens and flowers.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:07:58   | So you know, that's probably a pretty good summary of me and my life.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:03   | But if I go to all Photos, then it includes things, you know, this random screenshot of                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:06   | shortcuts that I took that I probably didn't want to keep.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:08:09   | And so I'm actually going to go ahead and delete that.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:08:11   | But you know, you can, you can actually just kind of hide some of the mess from yourself                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:17   | and albums will do the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:08:20   | So that's definitely worth remembering.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:22   | What about the problem arose of taking images and gluing them together?                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:08:27   | That's another one that apps have come in to automate for us.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:08:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:31   | So, you know, I mentioned earlier, shortcuts can do this.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:35   | And it is very, very good for doing that.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:38   | So you can, you can lay things out and you can stick them together horizontally.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:08:41   | You can stick them together vertically or stick them together in a grid.                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:08:45   | And if you need to get kind of fancy with how you're doing something, then you can,                                                                                                                              |
| 01:08:48   | you know, lay out the first two horizontally and the next two horizontally and then stick                                                                                                                        |
| 01:08:54   | those two together vertically in a grid of some kind.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:08:57   | Another app, which I'm going to recommend is actually the layout app by Instagram.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:09:02   | Now this is not necessarily the best or the smartest app, but essentially you, you select                                                                                                                        |
| 01:09:07   | a couple of pictures and then it gives you a couple of different layout options where                                                                                                                            |
| 01:09:11   | it can do like just, so I've selected four images right now and it's offering me a four                                                                                                                          |
| 01:09:15   | upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:09:16   | It's offering me like four narrow horizontal options, one big picture at the top and three                                                                                                                       |
| 01:09:22   | smaller images at the bottom for vertical skinny images, one big one on the left, three                                                                                                                          |
| 01:09:26   | small ones on the right, and then that sort of thing in various other layouts.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:32   | And that's pretty good, I have to say, you know, it's not perfect, but it, it's a good                                                                                                                           |
| 01:09:36   | starting point.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:09:38   | And that's definitely one that I use from time to time and you don't need to have the                                                                                                                            |
| 01:09:42   | Instagram app to use this to be clear, it's just, you know, a free app for download on                                                                                                                           |
| 01:09:46   | the app store.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:09:47   | But another one that I use, and this is probably because I take so many screenshots, David,                                                                                                                      |
| 01:09:53   | but pick so, P-I-C-S-E-W, it is one of my best friends when it comes to screenshots, especially                                                                                                                  |
| 01:10:01   | screenshots where it doesn't quite fit on one screen or I want to tidy up my menu bar                                                                                                                            |
| 01:10:07   | at the top, so it'll like replace the battery with full battery and change the time and                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:12   | hide my focus mode icon and wrap a little device frame around it.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:10:17   | But also it can just be really good for, hey, I want to stitch these two images together,                                                                                                                        |
| 01:10:22   | so I take, you know, two potentially unrelated screenshots and then I select them in pixel,                                                                                                                      |
| 01:10:27   | it can't auto-stitch them because it can't find any common ground between them, but I                                                                                                                            |
| 01:10:31   | can just tap on, you know, like the, the, the line where, you know, they've been stacked                                                                                                                         |
| 01:10:36   | on top of each other, stacked is perhaps the wrong word, placed vertically adjacent to                                                                                                                           |
| 01:10:42   | one another and then I can like scroll the top one down and the bottom one up and so                                                                                                                             |
| 01:10:46   | that I have, you know, a nice layout of whatever it is that I wanted.                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:10:51   | And that's definitely something that I'd recommend.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:10:54   | Yeah, and that is the app to use, PIXO.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:10:56   | I, I tried others and there was a time when there were three or four contenders and then                                                                                                                         |
| 01:11:01   | PIXO just kind of pulled forward and it's great.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:11:04   | A great use for this is if you do a lot of presentation work or you make like reports                                                                                                                            |
| 01:11:11   | like in you want to put images in them and have them tapped together, it gives you a                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11:16   | usable image.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:11:17   | That's great.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:11:18   | I like to use it sometimes when I do presentations and then I will put the entire image in and                                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:24   | then I'll duplicate the image and keynote and use magic move to be able to kind of move                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:28   | between places in the larger image as I, as I speak.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11:33   | And it's a, it's a boss move, but I was like, oh, how do you do that?                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:11:36   | And it's really PIXO plus magic move.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:11:39   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:11:40   | One thing I will say, if you've not downloaded PIXO before you have and you've, you know,                                                                                                                        |
| 01:11:45   | not used it in a while is in PIXO, go to the settings, go to the export preferences and                                                                                                                          |
| 01:11:51   | turn on prefers saving as PNG.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:11:54   | And the reason why I say this is because if like me, you like to use the device frames                                                                                                                           |
| 01:11:57   | for these images, if you do not turn on saving as PNG, then it will save those images with                                                                                                                       |
| 01:12:03   | a device frame on top as a JPEG, which means it's got a white background that you then                                                                                                                           |
| 01:12:06   | want to go and remove afterwards.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:12:08   | So if you just do the PNG, then you'll, you'll save yourself a little bit of time.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:12:13   | You can also enable hike lossless compression.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:16   | You can save things specifically to a PIXO album and you can set the image dimensions                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:22   | for things.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:12:23   | There's also like, you can customise a default watermark and there's also under the smart                                                                                                                        |
| 01:12:28   | recognition, you can turn on what you want smart recognition to do.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:12:32   | So do you want it to auto stitch recent screenshots, auto remove the scroll bar and auto clean                                                                                                                   |
| 01:12:37   | the status bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:39   | And then you can also say, okay, in the status bar, I want the uniform time.                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:12:43   | So that'll be 941 original time blank or custom text.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:12:48   | And if you put custom text in, then you can, you can have whatever you want, including                                                                                                                           |
| 01:12:51   | emoji, which can look a little odd, but you know, it works.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:12:56   | And yeah, there's, you know, there's a bunch of options in here and it's something that                                                                                                                          |
| 01:13:01   | I find incredibly useful.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:04   | Unfortunately, it doesn't have shortcut support, but it does have URL actions.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:13:10   | And so, you know, you can use it through that, but I also find I don't feel like I'm missing                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:16   | anything without having shortcut support, just because the process of stitching images                                                                                                                           |
| 01:13:22   | together does tend to be a little manual at least.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:13:26   | So yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:13:28   | Another category of automation that arose this past year is removing backgrounds.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:13:34   | It used to be such a tedious process to remove a background from an image and it just got                                                                                                                        |
| 01:13:40   | progressively easier, you know, at one point, Apple made the Alpha removal tool that they've                                                                                                                     |
| 01:13:45   | incorporated into Keynote and Pages and Preview.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:49   | But then third party apps like Pixelmator Pro got even more advanced to where like individual                                                                                                                    |
| 01:13:56   | strands of hair don't get removed, like it's very good.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:00   | And then Apple went real mainstream with it last year when they made the feature where                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:04   | you can go in the Photos app and just drag like your dog out of a picture and it just                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:09   | gets your dog without the couch in the background.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:12   | But the shortcuts team is never going to let something like that happen without getting                                                                                                                          |
| 01:14:17   | their hands on it.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:14:18   | And there are shortcuts actions now that allow you to remove the background and you can do                                                                                                                       |
| 01:14:25   | that with automation now, which is kind of fun.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:14:28   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:29   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:30   | It is really good fun.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:14:31   | And I have to say, you know, it is one of those things where you may not think, you know,                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:37   | I think that this is particularly useful.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:40   | And then I can't remember what it was I was doing the other day, but it ended up, oh,                                                                                                                            |
| 01:14:44   | that was it.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:14:45   | My parents were looking to put some things on eBay.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:14:48   | And so I just took some pictures of stuff and we laid it out on a nice playing background                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:53   | that was relatively plain, it was carpet.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:14:57   | And so I took the pictures and then just for fun, I ran them through a shortcut which picked                                                                                                                     |
| 01:15:01   | out the subject and just, you know, sent them just the subject of the pictures to my parents.                                                                                                                    |
| 01:15:07   | And that's the ones that they ended up using because, you know, it just removed the background                                                                                                                   |
| 01:15:12   | entirely for them and it looked pretty good, I have to say.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:15:15   | So, you know, it's something you may not think that you need all that often and, you know,                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:19   | I'm not going to say that you do need it all the time, but it's definitely, definitely                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:24   | worth considering.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:15:25   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:27   | And it's just so easy now.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:28   | I wonder if that feature is used as much, I mean, when the, is used as much now as it                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:31   | was when the feature first released, like, I'm not sure it's kind of gone viral the way                                                                                                                          |
| 01:15:36   | Apple probably wanted it to, but it is very nice to be able to, to drag the background                                                                                                                           |
| 01:15:42   | off an image and like send it to somebody.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:15:44   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:45   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:15:46   | I don't know how often it's used either, but you know what?                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:15:48   | I also don't really mind as long as there, there's, you know, at least a couple of people                                                                                                                        |
| 01:15:53   | using it so that the Shortcuts team gets some stats feedback of like, yeah, we did this,                                                                                                                         |
| 01:15:57   | you did a good job.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:15:58   | So, you know, all good, all good there.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:01   | So years ago, I made a, a location removal shortcut and basically whenever you convert                                                                                                                           |
| 01:16:08   | an image in Shortcuts, you have the option to remove metadata.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:13   | And I always thought that was a nice way.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:15   | Like if you have a picture of yourself at your house and you want to send it to somebody,                                                                                                                        |
| 01:16:19   | but you don't want them to be able to see where it was taken, it's just a conversion                                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:25   | image shortcut.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:16:27   | And, but it is converting the image at the same time, but that's fine, I'm putting into                                                                                                                          |
| 01:16:31   | JPEG, it's not a big deal, causes some degradation the more you convert an image.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:16:36   | And I got thinking beforehand, how are you doing, or do you have a shortcut for that                                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:40   | these days?                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:16:41   | And if so, how are you doing it?                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:16:43   | So I don't have a shortcut for this.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:16:46   | But that's not necessarily because I don't need one, but I think over time, app developers                                                                                                                       |
| 01:16:52   | have become very aware that this is something that people are concerned about.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:16:56   | And also, more regulations come in to say that app developers need to protect people                                                                                                                             |
| 01:17:01   | from themselves and from accidentally revealing public information.                                                                                                                                              |
| 01:17:05   | So I tend not to worry about this too much.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:09   | And instead, what I do is I just let the apps handle it, because I found a lot of the time,                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:16   | if you try and upload something somewhere, then not only will the app remove this metadata,                                                                                                                      |
| 01:17:26   | they'll also do things like remove the metadata of which devices was taken on, and things                                                                                                                        |
| 01:17:30   | like that, and they'll scale it down, because they don't want to be uploading a full version,                                                                                                                    |
| 01:17:35   | and they're usually not always, but usually going to do the scaling down on your local                                                                                                                           |
| 01:17:39   | device so that then you don't have to upload the big file, because it's upload that's more                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:44   | difficult with this stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:17:45   | So I tend not to worry about that, though I did realise the other day when I was at                                                                                                                              |
| 01:17:50   | a local burger joint, and I was taking a picture, I shared a picture on Instagram of their wallet,                                                                                                               |
| 01:17:56   | it was an Instagram story folks, so it's disappeared, but they have a Ghostbusters                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:00   | skateboard of the state of Marshmallow Man, and it's amazing.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:04   | But I was like, actually, you know what, I'm not going to tag this with my location, because                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:07   | this is surprisingly close to my house.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:18:09   | It's not somewhere I go very often, but I was like, yeah, I'm not going to tag it.                                                                                                                               |
| 01:18:12   | So that tends to be the kind of thing that I'm doing there rather than worrying about                                                                                                                            |
| 01:18:17   | the location embedded inside of an image.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:18:20   | But I think iOS is fairly good at not sharing that with people unless you have full access                                                                                                                       |
| 01:18:29   | to the photos.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:18:30   | I guess my question would be, does messages strip that data when you send somebody a message?                                                                                                                    |
| 01:18:37   | I don't think it does.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:18:38   | That is a good question.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:18:39   | We will have to test it after the show and find out.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:18:41   | If it doesn't, what I would recommend is making a quick shortcut to message a photo, so you                                                                                                                      |
| 01:18:46   | could just have it strip the data with the convert image action and then open a new message.                                                                                                                     |
| 01:18:54   | It just gives you a way to kind of sanitise that.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:18:56   | It's not really an issue for me, but if I was younger and in the dating scene and maybe                                                                                                                          |
| 01:19:01   | messaging somebody that I may be interested in, but I don't necessarily want to give them                                                                                                                        |
| 01:19:06   | my location just yet, I'm just thinking of scenarios like that.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:19:12   | It's a weird world we live in, game.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:19:14   | It is, and I think it's one of those things where a lot of the time if somebody is doing                                                                                                                         |
| 01:19:18   | something like that, there's probably going to be an app involved that's removing that                                                                                                                           |
| 01:19:23   | image instead of using the messages app, but you never know.                                                                                                                                                     |

| 01:21:16   | All right, Rose, let's set aside images for a minute.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:21:21   | I need to talk to you about something.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21:23   | I've been having a lot of fun.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:21:25   | I know this is beta.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:21:26   | It's not out for everybody yet, but there is a public beta of it available.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:30   | But the shortcuts team did it again.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:21:31   | They added something cool.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:21:33   | And in the 16.4 beta, they've added an intercom action where you can send text to your home                                                                                                                      |
| 01:21:40   | pod.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:21:41   | And historically, if you wanted as part of your shortcut, your HomePod to yell something                                                                                                                        |
| 01:21:46   | at you, it was a mess.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:21:48   | You had to create an audio file and then save it to your music library, at least this is                                                                                                                         |
| 01:21:52   | the way I did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:21:53   | And then you would have it play that song.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 01:21:56   | I'm holding up air quotes as I say song, which was totally nuts.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:21:59   | And it was not dynamic.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:22:01   | It had to be prerecorded, whereas now you can have it generate text, tell you what the                                                                                                                           |
| 01:22:07   | temperature is or whatever.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:22:09   | And then like the morning routine scripts, we've talked about that often, giving me the                                                                                                                          |
| 01:22:14   | morning report, but you can have it just feed that to the intercom now action and speak                                                                                                                          |
| 01:22:19   | it to you dynamically.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:22:21   | And you can have it pick which HomePods get it.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:22:25   | I've been having a good time playing with this.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:22:27   | And I feel like this is a big step up for people who have HomePods and want to use                                                                                                                              |
| 01:22:30   | automation.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:22:32   | I agree.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:22:33   | And I think that this is in particular is very useful for folks who are essentially just                                                                                                                         |
| 01:22:40   | trying to communicate either with themselves or with somebody else so that you can easily                                                                                                                        |
| 01:22:48   | share information without having to yell it.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 01:22:51   | And I feel like the intercom feature on the HomePod is something that people don't really                                                                                                                       |
| 01:22:55   | talk about all that much.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:22:56   | But essentially what you can do is say, hey, Apple lady intercom to your devices and depending                                                                                                                   |
| 01:23:02   | on your home settings and HomePods, it can send a message to other people in your home                                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:08   | kit home.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:23:10   | But this is really useful because you can intercom to a room.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:23:14   | You can intercom to a zone or you can intercom to a person.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:23:18   | And so when I tap on the intercom action in shortcuts, there's two fields to fill out.                                                                                                                           |
| 01:23:23   | The first one is whatever you want to say and suggested Texas dinner is ready.                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:23:29   | But then after that, if there is depending on how many homes you have, it may just say                                                                                                                           |
| 01:23:37   | the name of a home or you can select specific areas.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:23:43   | So for me, I can select the whole home for all of the homes that I'm in, or I can select                                                                                                                         |
| 01:23:49   | specific rooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:23:50   | Now intercom does usually allow you to address zones and so on as well.                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:23:55   | And I don't see those showing up in my shortcut section, but I also don't actually need to                                                                                                                       |
| 01:24:02   | address the zones.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:24:03   | I just use the zones for basically, these are real places and these are not real places                                                                                                                          |
| 01:24:08   | as far as home kit is concerned.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:24:10   | So I have like the utility zone, which is basically anything that isn't a room.                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:24:14   | So Christmas is a utility zone and automation is a utility zone and 3D printer is also in                                                                                                                        |
| 01:24:22   | the utility zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:24:23   | But yeah, this is really nice that this is here.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:24:27   | And I have been combining this with one of my favourite little widget apps, signals for                                                                                                                           |
| 01:24:32   | home kit, because this has just made my life much easier.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:24:38   | So that when my alarm clock goes off in the morning and then I hit snooze, I get the flashing                                                                                                                    |
| 01:24:43   | lights and I also get intercom, specifically to the bedroom in this case going, you should                                                                                                                       |
| 01:24:47   | probably get up.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:24:48   | It's XYZ time and I've put it put the actual time in there, because if you hit the snooze                                                                                                                        |
| 01:24:54   | a couple of times or you know, you have variable alarms on different days, you probably need                                                                                                                     |
| 01:24:59   | to know what the time is if you're if you're struggling to get up in the morning.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:25:02   | So yeah, that that's definitely something I've been playing with and I'm finding it                                                                                                                              |
| 01:25:06   | really useful and hopefully other people will as well.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:25:09   | Yeah, and and and I like the idea that, you know, you can, the action has text you can                                                                                                                           |
| 01:25:16   | fill in, but you can also just call a variable so you can generate text as part of your shortcut                                                                                                                 |
| 01:25:22   | and then send it like a couple examples right now.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:25:26   | I've got it giving me text every day at 430pm telling me it's time to shut down.                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:25:32   | That's a very simple one.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:25:33   | It's using a time based automation trigger.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:25:36   | I'm also perfecting one where if I'm working in the garage and Daisy comes home because                                                                                                                          |
| 01:25:43   | they're not connected to the front door, I like to know she came home, you know, so                                                                                                                              |
| 01:25:47   | it tells me when the front door opens when I'm in the other room.                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:25:51   | So just like stuff like that, it's simple shortcuts, but you know, that's kind of the                                                                                                                            |
| 01:25:55   | idea of shortcuts anyway.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 01:25:57   | And by allowing you to send addressable text to a HomePod, you can make it easier on yourself                                                                                                                   |
| 01:26:03   | and you can make it easier on the people with you.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 01:26:05   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:26:07   | And that's definitely something that I feel like everybody will appreciate.                                                                                                                                      |
| 01:26:11   | Or even like I can make it do one where when I'm leaving on my way home, I could, I can                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:17   | address the HomePod remotely so I can, I can just make a shortcut rather than texting                                                                                                                           |
| 01:26:23   | her I'm on my way and I'll be there in so many minutes.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:26:27   | If you're with somebody who doesn't check their phone often, you can have the HomePod                                                                                                                           |
| 01:26:30   | yell it out for you and that's kind of nice too.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:34   | It is on the phone and iPad now it's not on the Mac, the action.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 01:26:38   | I'm not sure why I feel like it should be, but you know, I guess we'll figure it out.                                                                                                                            |
| 01:26:43   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:26:44   | I'm sure we will.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 01:26:45   | And I think it's one of these things as well where it depends on what kind of automation                                                                                                                         |
| 01:26:50   | you are creating or running as to, you know, what it is that you want or need from this.                                                                                                                         |
| 01:26:58   | So I personally have found that this makes a lot more sense in my personal automations                                                                                                                           |
| 01:27:04   | rather than the home kit automations, but it sounds like you've been, you've been finding                                                                                                                        |
| 01:27:08   | both of them to be, to be useful, David.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:27:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:11   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:12   | I just think it's a good, it's a good step and I'm glad they didn't hold it back for                                                                                                                             |
| 01:27:16   | the next major release.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 01:27:17   | It's, you know, I'm really happy when I see the HomePod team pushing through stuff like                                                                                                                         |
| 01:27:22   | this.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:23   | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:27:24   | So I have to say, so I was, I was thinking, oh, actually I have an idea for something                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:27   | that I'd like to use one of the home kit automations converted to a shortcut for.                                                                                                                                |
| 01:27:32   | And I don't see the home, the intercom action in the home kit shortcuts actions, David.                                                                                                                          |
| 01:27:38   | Are you seeing it there?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 01:27:40   | Is that just my phone and I need to restart because this does happen every once in a while                                                                                                                       |
| 01:27:44   | or is it maybe only available in, you know, your personal shortcuts?                                                                                                                                             |
| 01:27:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:51   | It has to be through your personal shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:27:52   | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 01:27:53   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:54   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:55   | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:56   | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:27:57   | Back to my push kit automation.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 01:27:58   | So here it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 01:27:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 01:28:00   | There you go.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 01:28:01   | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

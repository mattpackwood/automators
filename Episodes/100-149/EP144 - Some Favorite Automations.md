| 00:00      | Hello, I'm David Sparks and welcome to the Automators where Rosemary Orchard and I spend           |
| 00:06      | our time teaching you how to make your technology do your bidding for you.                         |
| 00:11      | Hi, Rose.                                                                                          |
| 00:12      | Hey David Sparks, how are you?                                                                     |
| 00:14      | I am great.                                                                                        |
| 00:16      | It's the end of the year, kind of a short episode.                                                 |
| 00:19      | We wanted to do just kind of a little short, let's share a few automations episode.                |
| 00:24      | We know it's a holidays and people are off doing things, but we wanted to come to you              |
| 00:29      | this week anyway.                                                                                  |
| 00:30      | So here we are.                                                                                    |
| 00:31      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 00:32      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 00:33      | And we thought it would be great just to talk about a couple of those automations that             |
| 00:36      | we've got in our lives that are really making things easier and more fun for us.                   |
| 00:40      | And just being useful, even like the little things that we don't really think about all            |
| 00:45      | that much.                                                                                         |
| 00:46      | I've been trying to think really hard for those because that's the sort of things that             |
| 00:51      | people actually end up finding the most useful.                                                    |
| 00:54      | So here we are.                                                                                    |
| 00:55      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 00:56      | So let's go, Rose, let's do this.                                                                  |
| 00:59      | You want to go first?                                                                              |
| 01:01      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                        |
| 01:02      | So I have a couple of devices which produce their own Wi-Fi network and then they've got           |
| 01:07      | like an app on your phone that you open and like it talks to the device.                           |
| 01:13      | So some of them are like little cameras and so on so that you can view something but you           |
| 01:18      | don't have to like hook it up to another Wi-Fi network.                                            |
| 01:21      | My [[Nintendo Switch]] is another obvious example of this and I've got a DJI Osmo pocket which         |
| 01:30      | does the same sort of thing where it's got its Wi-Fi network and you can connect to                |
| 01:33      | it to download the photos and open and control the camera.                                         |
| 01:38      | And so I have been setting up little shortcuts automations for these.                              |
| 01:42      | So whenever I connect to the Wi-Fi network for those devices, it just opens the app.               |
| 01:47      | It's really simple.                                                                                |
| 01:48      | It's a one step automation.                                                                        |
| 01:50      | I didn't even bother making this into a shortcut that I made into an automation.                   |
| 01:53      | I just opened the darn app.                                                                        |
| 01:56      | But you know what?                                                                                 |
| 01:57      | It makes my life so much easier because all I have to do is open the control centre, long          |
| 02:00      | press on the Wi-Fi symbol and select the Wi-Fi network and of course these networks don't          |
| 02:05      | have internet so iOS is going to prioritise literally anything else it can above connecting        |
| 02:10      | to these Wi-Fi networks by default.                                                                |
| 02:12      | But yeah, I tap on it and it'll open the web page or whatever to connect to these things           |
| 02:19      | or the app to connect to the camera or whatever it is and that makes my life so much easier        |
| 02:25      | and I've been doing this for me, but I've also done this to my parents because they've             |
| 02:28      | got a couple of health gadgets and so on that it can sync the data to their devices.               |
| 02:34      | But yeah, they were having a little difficulty walking through the whole steps.                    |
| 02:37      | So I have set it up so that whenever they connect to the Wi-Fi network, it will automatically      |
| 02:42      | open the apps for them and do the same for me.                                                     |
| 02:45      | And honestly, it's very simple, very basic, so useful.                                             |
| 02:49      | And it just saves me a couple of taps like remembering what is the name of this app thing          |
| 02:52      | anyway, I don't need to deal with that anymore.                                                    |
| 02:56      | I feel like the open app trigger is a very rich vein of automation that I think a lot              |
| 03:01      | of people don't take advantage of because you can use it so many, I mean, there's two              |
| 03:06      | different ways to use it.                                                                          |
| 03:07      | First of all is like if you're doing something and every time you do that thing, you want          |
| 03:11      | this app in front of you, then why not just have it open the app?                                  |
| 03:16      | But I think the flip side of it is even probably easier to automate for people because you're      |
| 03:20      | opening the app already and using the app opening action as a trigger can be just so               |
| 03:26      | powerful.                                                                                          |
| 03:27      | Like if, let's say, I'm a big fan of focus modes on the iPhone, I think they really can            |
| 03:32      | make a difference because these things are interruption devices.                                   |
| 03:37      | We need to live our lives without them owning us.                                                  |
| 03:40      | And like, let's say you like to read a book every evening, what would have every time you          |
| 03:44      | open the Kindle app or the [[Apple Books]] app, your phone just kind of went into a secluded           |
| 03:51      | mode and notifications were cut off except from all except the most very important people          |
| 03:56      | in your life.                                                                                      |
| 03:57      | And like all that noise just went away and you can just read the book on your phone and            |
| 04:02      | it's not going to interrupt you.                                                                   |
| 04:04      | I mean, people buy Kindles because they're like, well, I like it because it's a unit               |
| 04:09      | tasker and it's a device where it just allows me to read words and it doesn't interrupt me.        |
| 04:14      | But if you use that trigger of saying every time I open the Kindle app, turn off everything,       |
| 04:20      | well then you just turn your phone into a unit tasker device when you're in Kindle.                |
| 04:24      | And it's a very easy automation and I think I wish more people would try it.                       |
| 04:29      | Yes.                                                                                               |
| 04:30      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 04:31      | And I think it's one of those things where it can be a little difficult to wrap your               |
| 04:34      | head around this whole idea as a beginning point to start with just because it is, your            |
| 04:41      | phone can do so many things now and your iPad can do the same and it doesn't matter which          |
| 04:45      | device you're doing these automations on and you should probably experiment with doing             |
| 04:49      | them on multiple devices, but having the ability to just do a thing when that app opens.           |
| 04:55      | When I open certain apps, I disable rotation lock because usually I have rotation lock             |
| 05:03      | on so that my phone doesn't randomly flip between portrait and landscape if I'm holding            |
| 05:07      | it at a slightly wonky angle or whatever, but there are some apps that I need landscape            |
| 05:12      | access for and so I have that enabled via the open app action.                                     |
| 05:17      | So whenever I open those apps, that landscape is enabled for them and then when I close            |
| 05:23      | the app, it goes away and it's locked again and that just makes my life a lot easier.              |
| 05:28      | So it's definitely worth looking into both the connecting to Wi-Fi triggers for some               |
| 05:32      | things and then opening an app as a consequence or connecting to a Bluetooth device and opening    |
| 05:38      | an app as well.                                                                                    |
| 05:39      | You can do that for headphones and so on, like Sony headphones and so on, have their               |
| 05:41      | own app that you may want to open.                                                                 |
| 05:45      | And yeah, so there's plenty of options there with just two simple shortcuts actions.               |
| 05:50      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 05:51      | I just think the whole app opening as a trigger and as an action is underutilised and I would      |
| 05:58      | encourage you if you're listening to think about that.                                             |
| 06:00      | Maybe there is a trigger you can connect to that.                                                  |
| 06:04      | I've got a year-end automation here that is the world's simplest automation.                       |
| 06:10      | I'm not even sure if this qualifies as an automation, but in my head it does.                      |
| 06:14      | Okay, go for it.                                                                                   |
| 06:15      | This is the problem.                                                                               |
| 06:18      | I try at four o'clock each day to stop and answer email and check social media and do              |
| 06:23      | all that stuff.                                                                                    |
| 06:25      | I have the opposite problem of most of the world.                                                  |
| 06:27      | A lot of people get hung up on this stuff where they can't get out of the inbox and                |
| 06:31      | they can't get out of TikTok or whatever.                                                          |
| 06:36      | My problem is the opposite.                                                                        |
| 06:37      | I just never want to check any of that stuff.                                                      |
| 06:40      | I like making stuff.                                                                               |
| 06:42      | I just don't, email to me is the last thing I want to deal with as well with social media          |
| 06:46      | and stuff like that.                                                                               |
| 06:47      | It's just such an extent that it causes a problem.                                                 |
| 06:50      | So I decided I'm going to give myself permission to not look at any of this stuff all day,         |
| 06:57      | but every day at four o'clock, 1600, I'm going to spend an hour and get through as much            |
| 07:02      | of it as I can and make that like the dedicated hour of communications.                            |
| 07:06      | So Rose, how do I get myself to do that?                                                           |
| 07:09      | I have tried all these automations over the years.                                                 |
| 07:12      | I did one where at four o'clock my HomePod would yell at me because you can do that now.          |
| 07:19      | You can send a text message to your HomePod and it'll read it to you.                             |
| 07:23      | I have this light strip around my desk and it would turn red and it was like the bridge            |
| 07:27      | of the Starship Enterprise and the Klingons just showed up and it was time for me to do            |
| 07:32      | comms.                                                                                             |
| 07:33      | But guess what?                                                                                    |
| 07:34      | If I'm not at my desk, it didn't matter, right?                                                    |
| 07:36      | And then I'd come in here and the lights would be red and that would make me mad.                  |
| 07:42      | That was an automation that didn't really work for me, even though it should have, right?          |
| 07:47      | In terms of getting me to do the comms, I've tried all these different techniques and what         |
| 07:51      | I've settled on the last three or four months is, and this is where I'm not sure if it's           |
| 07:56      | automation, but every day at four o'clock there's a standing alarm on my Apple Watch               |
| 08:02      | and my wrist taps.                                                                                 |
| 08:03      | So no matter where I am, it just taps and it does say, hey, column's time, you know,               |
| 08:09      | whatever.                                                                                          |
| 08:10      | It's got a little message, but every day at four o'clock it goes off six days a week.              |
| 08:15      | So that is my new automation and that's the best one so far in terms of making me stop             |
| 08:21      | and deal with email.                                                                               |
| 08:23      | It's just a little alarm on my wrist.                                                              |
| 08:26      | So is that a fake or automation?                                                                   |
| 08:28      | I think it might be.                                                                               |
| 08:29      | I'm not sure.                                                                                      |
| 08:30      | I mean, I think the thing is, is that you need a solution here that's going to get you             |
| 08:34      | to do the thing and you could have an automation on your phone that says, hey, when this alarm     |
| 08:38      | goes off, open Tech Talk or whatever it is, maybe not Tech Talk, maybe Ivory or something          |
| 08:43      | so you could go on Macedon or similar.                                                             |
| 08:46      | But you know, if that can be quite interruptive as somebody who does have automations that         |
| 08:52      | open certain apps automatically at various points, you know, I have to be very careful             |
| 08:58      | with those because the number of times when I was first setting these up that I would              |
| 09:02      | just be like, yeah, sure.                                                                          |
| 09:03      | So like just interrupt whatever I'm doing, it's fine.                                              |
| 09:07      | Go ahead and open like this app for me and then it would be like, no, I was in the middle          |
| 09:13      | of like, I'd scan a QR code, I've mostly filled out a form, like I'd almost completed              |
| 09:18      | my dinner order and now I have to go through and do the whole thing again because, yeah,           |
| 09:22      | I was at a restaurant the other day for some reason, weirdly enough, by the way, you scan          |
| 09:26      | the QR code and the menu worked there.                                                             |
| 09:28      | If you tapped on the little icon and opened it in [[Safari]], no, couldn't actually place              |
| 09:33      | an order.                                                                                          |
| 09:34      | Everything was unavailable.                                                                        |
| 09:35      | So weird.                                                                                          |
| 09:36      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 09:37      | See, and that was one version of this for me.                                                      |
| 09:38      | I had it where it just shut down everything on my screen and just said, and opened the             |
| 09:44      | email app.                                                                                         |
| 09:45      | But that was kind of insane in hindsight, you know.                                                |
| 09:50      | I think it really depends on like how critical something is because if something is absolutely     |
| 09:55      | critical, like you must drop absolutely everything else regardless of what you're doing to deal    |
| 10:00      | with this thing, then by all means have something take over your phone.                            |
| 10:04      | But if there is a possibility, even like a 10%, 15%, 20% possibility that whatever else            |
| 10:11      | you're doing at that moment could be more important than the thing that you wanted to              |
| 10:16      | do at that time.                                                                                   |
| 10:17      | And the thing that you wanted to do at that time could be pushed back by 15, 20 minutes.           |
| 10:21      | Then yeah, I think using the just open an app at this time automations can be a little             |
| 10:27      | bit tricky.                                                                                        |
| 10:29      | So yeah, it's one of those things where I, it almost makes me wonder, Apple, we're kind            |
| 10:33      | of slow to implement, you know, automation, like proper automation for all of the other            |
| 10:38      | triggers, but they were really gung-ho happy of, yeah, sure, at this specific time, your           |
| 10:42      | phone could just go off and do this thing for you.                                                 |
| 10:45      | And it's like, I feel like that one is the one that's most likely to backfire on a user,           |
| 10:50      | to be honest, like connecting to this Wi-Fi network or that Wi-Fi network or a Bluetooth           |
| 10:54      | device doesn't feel as likely to trigger and have an accidental unintended consequence.            |
| 11:00      | Yeah, it's like, uh, if you live on the lost island, that would be important, right?               |
| 11:05      | You had to type in those numbers every 30 minutes or whatever.                                     |
| 11:08      | Well, that, okay, but otherwise, yeah.                                                             |
| 11:12      | So that was an automation idea and honestly just make a watch alarm as silly as it sounds.         |
| 11:17      | I feel like it's an automation because it's got my brain now kind of wired.                        |
| 11:21      | And when it goes off, I say, okay, I need to do that.                                              |
| 11:24      | And that doesn't mean I'm going to drop everything in this moment, but it's enough that it works.  |
| 11:29      | And I don't even really need to snooze.                                                            |
| 11:30      | So that seems to have been working for me, but, you know, we've all got to figure out              |
| 11:35      | our own way in this struggle sometimes.                                                            |
| 11:38      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                   |
| 11:39      | And I think that that is the thing with automation, you know, just because I've got a thing that   |
| 11:43      | works for me doesn't mean that it will work for you or for somebody listening to the show.         |
| 11:47      | But hopefully between the ideas that we have, there are some things that will trigger something    |
| 11:52      | that just, oh, yeah, that could make my life a little bit easier, actually.                        |
| 11:56      | But speaking of making life a little bit easier, I've made getting home easier, David.             |
| 12:03      | So I have added some home automations for when I arrive home.                                      |
| 12:09      | And I've been tweaking with these, playing with these for a while.                                 |
| 12:12      | And what I've done, because I'm using [[Home Assistant]], is quite easy to set a little bit            |
| 12:16      | of a delay on it.                                                                                  |
| 12:18      | And so when I'm arriving home, I have it just wait for a couple of minutes so it doesn't           |
| 12:22      | immediately start on everything.                                                                   |
| 12:24      | But what will happen is my...                                                                      |
| 12:27      | So I have some vertical blinds in front of the door that I used to go in and out because           |
| 12:31      | I use my patio doors to come in and out.                                                           |
| 12:33      | And so they're vertical, so they rotate, you know, and then they open, they have an opening        |
| 12:38      | in the middle.                                                                                     |
| 12:40      | And so I would like them to be open when I go to go through the patio doors, because               |
| 12:43      | I always open the patio door and go to walk in and you get trapped in the blind and they're        |
| 12:47      | waving your arms around going, nah, I'm stuck in the blind.                                        |
| 12:50      | Maybe not.                                                                                         |
| 12:51      | I'm usually a bit cleverer than that.                                                              |
| 12:52      | It can be quite annoying if you've got bags full of shopping or something, having to press         |
| 12:56      | buttons and wait.                                                                                  |
| 12:57      | And the whole point of having blinds that are on automation things is that they can be             |
| 13:02      | automated.                                                                                         |
| 13:03      | So I have it wait just a couple of minutes after I'm arriving home.                                |
| 13:08      | And then it will rotate the blinds back so that they are perpendicular to the door and             |
| 13:12      | then open them in the middle, because if you open them when they're off an angle, then             |
| 13:18      | they kind of stick out a little bit into the room and in front of the doorway.                     |
| 13:22      | And so that happens.                                                                               |
| 13:24      | And then obviously at this time of year, it's pretty dark.                                         |
| 13:28      | So I've been fine-tuning what the definition of dark is for my living room.                        |
| 13:34      | And he might be thinking, well, dark is easy to define, right?                                     |
| 13:37      | If the sun's down, it's dark.                                                                      |
| 13:38      | Yes, but it is dark before the sun goes down.                                                      |
| 13:42      | And it's not just when the sun is at this point in the sky, it could be to do with how             |
| 13:45      | many clouds there are and just time of year, all sorts of things.                                  |
| 13:50      | So I have got a light sensor, which I've been moving around my living room a little bit            |
| 13:54      | to try and figure out the best place for and logging the light levels.                             |
| 13:58      | And so basically it checks if the light levels are low.                                            |
| 14:01      | And if the light levels are, so I have basically three categories.                                 |
| 14:07      | I do not need lights.                                                                              |
| 14:08      | I need some lights.                                                                                |
| 14:09      | I need all the lights, all the lighting, please, immediately.                                      |
| 14:13      | And so if I do not need lights, no lights, come on, I need some lighting.                          |
| 14:17      | Then I have a little uplighter come on, and then I have some Nanoleaf light panels come           |
| 14:20      | on.                                                                                                |
| 14:21      | And they don't come on very brightly.                                                              |
| 14:22      | They come on to about 25%.                                                                         |
| 14:23      | It's just a nice way to come home.                                                                 |
| 14:26      | And if it's all the lights, please, then the uplighter comes on, Nanoleaf light panels            |
| 14:29      | come on.                                                                                           |
| 14:30      | They still only come on at about 50% just because I don't need to be blinded by them.              |
| 14:34      | And then the overhead lights come on as well.                                                      |
| 14:36      | And I've just been fuzzing around playing with this, but the light sensor, I'm figuring            |
| 14:40      | out what is bright, what is dim, and what is dark for me has made a huge difference because        |
| 14:46      | it just feels, you know, when I'm coming home, it's comfortable every time.                        |
| 14:50      | Like there's no sense of I'm walking into a dark room and like, you know, anything                 |
| 14:56      | could be in here.                                                                                  |
| 14:57      | I mean, I know that things in there, worst case scenario, spider snuck in as I was leaving,        |
| 15:01      | in which case it's going to get booted out of the house ASAP.                                      |
| 15:03      | And if it doesn't adhere to my stranger requests and requirements, then it may have to deal        |
| 15:10      | with a vacuum cleaner, which is its own fault for not listening in the first place.                |
| 15:13      | But yeah, I've just been fuzzing around with that and it makes it so much nicer.                   |
| 15:18      | And you know, I previously had something set up and it was hooked on, you know, when               |
| 15:21      | I hit the open garage door button in CarPlay, which would open the blinds and, you know,           |
| 15:27      | you know, unlock the door for me, but I've set it up now.                                          |
| 15:30      | So it's just, you know, it's just attached to me arriving home.                                    |
| 15:33      | And then if I leave home, you know, if I walk home and then just get in the car and drive          |
| 15:36      | off, then everything goes off again anyway.                                                        |
| 15:39      | So it's working out quite nicely.                                                                  |
| 15:40      | Okay, I'd like to kind of go a little deeper on that part, like how it knows you're around         |
| 15:45      | to trigger it all.                                                                                 |
| 15:47      | Like presumably if you're out with your friends, the lights don't care what the light sensor       |
| 15:52      | is.                                                                                                |
| 15:53      | They just stay off.                                                                                |
| 15:54      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 15:55      | They just stay off.                                                                                |
| 15:56      | So how does it know whether or not to go through the routine of turning it itself on or not?       |
| 16:02      | Well, I just use my location as a trigger.                                                         |
| 16:05      | So I have the [[Home Assistant]] app on my phone and it has a way of detecting if you're home          |
| 16:11      | or away or at another location.                                                                    |
| 16:14      | And so when it goes from not home to home, then I just have it trigger.                            |
| 16:20      | Well, I have it wait a few minutes and then trigger.                                               |
| 16:22      | And it does that by the presence of your phone, correct?                                           |
| 16:26      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 16:27      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 16:28      | I see, I find that with [[Home Assistant]], that can work.                                             |
| 16:31      | With [[HomeKit]], I think it's pretty wonky.                                                           |
| 16:34      | Oh yeah, the number of times I've woken up at like, you know, early in the morning to              |
| 16:38      | go to the bathroom or something, I've glanced at my phone and it's been like, this camera          |
| 16:42      | changed from stream to stream and allow recording because everybody left home.                     |
| 16:46      | This camera changed from stream and allow recording to just streaming because somebody             |
| 16:49      | arrived home and it's like, I've been lying in bed all night.                                      |
| 16:53      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 16:54      | Like my phone has not moved from its charging dock.                                                |
| 16:57      | What's going on here, [[HomeKit]]?                                                                     |
| 16:58      | Something is up there.                                                                             |
| 16:59      | So yeah, I use [[Home Assistant]] for that.                                                            |
| 17:02      | And that's one of the reasons why I have the buffer on it, because I have to go from my            |
| 17:05      | state not being home to my state being home and my state has to stay home for two minutes          |
| 17:10      | before this triggers.                                                                              |
| 17:11      | And that's something that's quite easy to do with the [[Home Assistant]] triggers, essentially         |
| 17:15      | on the trigger.                                                                                    |
| 17:17      | And yeah, that works nicely for me.                                                                |
| 17:19      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 17:20      | Something that has got much better for me in the last month with no effort on my behalf            |
| 17:26      | is my car home, a [[Human Presence Sensor\|human presence sensor]].                                                           |
| 17:30      | Oh, nice.                                                                                          |
| 17:31      | I have one that's attached to [[Home Assistant]] elsewhere in the house and I have one in the          |
| 17:36      | studio that is the [[HomeKit]] version, it's bulkier and slower, but it works with [[HomeKit]].            |
| 17:44      | And it just never worked very well.                                                                |
| 17:46      | And then just like about a month ago, it started working really well.                              |
| 17:50      | And I walk in the room, the lights turn on, I walk out of the room, the lights turn off.           |
| 17:54      | And that's what you need, right?                                                                   |
| 17:56      | That's what so many people want out of home automation is just the ability to have the             |
| 18:02      | lights turn off and on when they walk in without any effort.                                       |
| 18:05      | And honestly, that has been something that has been quite difficult up until now because           |
| 18:10      | these infrared sensors that, you know, the sensors that we were using really weren't               |
| 18:14      | appropriate and like if you stop moving, then they would turn the lights off while you're          |
| 18:19      | still in the room.                                                                                 |
| 18:20      | And [[Human Presence Sensor\|human presence sensors]] are supposed to solve that problem.                                     |
| 18:23      | That was one of the big things of 2023 is the arrival of these Aqara sensors.                      |
| 18:28      | But I think it must have got itself a hardware, like a firmware update or something without        |
| 18:34      | me realising it, or maybe when [[HomeKit\|Apple HomeKit]] switched architecture, which it did about             |
| 18:39      | two months ago, maybe that's when it got better.                                                   |
| 18:42      | But either way, suddenly, my Aqara [[HomeKit]] enabled, [[Human Presence Sensor\|human presence sensor]] just started             |
| 18:48      | working and now when I walk in the room, lights turn on, walk out of the room, lights turn         |
| 18:52      | off, very useful, except when I want to use the room as a studio where I need lighting             |
| 18:57      | at a certain level and then I just turn that automation off and I have different automations.      |
| 19:03      | And that is, you know, totally usable for me.                                                      |
| 19:06      | And that's been a really nice thing to have happen to me recently.                                 |
| 19:10      | Yeah, no, that's really good that it's working.                                                    |
| 19:14      | I've got two of the original ones, I've been playing with them and fine-tuning them because        |
| 19:19      | I've been waiting for the right moment and it's kind of difficult when you've already              |
| 19:23      | got a system that works, like I always want to play with the shiny new thing.                      |
| 19:30      | And so, you know, I kind of have to restrain myself at times and be like, no, Rose, things         |
| 19:34      | are working.                                                                                       |
| 19:36      | If things are working, that means that you leave them alone, you don't just go play with           |
| 19:41      | them for three hours and make everything broken.                                                   |
| 19:44      | And especially this time of year, you know, I don't want to be messing with the lighting           |
| 19:47      | because there is nothing more dangerous than getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle        |
| 19:50      | of the night and expecting the lights to automatically turn on and then they don't.                |
| 19:56      | That is a recipe for tripping over something in the dark, which I have done once.                  |
| 20:02      | And fortunately, I was waiting for this moment not to trip over in the dark, but I was waiting     |
| 20:06      | for the battery in my hallway motion sensor, just a standard motion sensor, to go out because      |
| 20:13      | I had been messing in my office.                                                                   |
| 20:15      | My office is the room that I'm allowed to mess with things with, as long as I also leave           |
| 20:18      | a working solution in place.                                                                       |
| 20:21      | I've been messing with some of the Aqara motion sensors.                                           |
| 20:24      | And so I have replaced my battery powered motion sensor in my hallway with a USB powered           |
| 20:28      | Aqara motion sensor, which is the FP1 [[Human Presence Sensor\|human presence sensor]].                                       |
| 20:32      | And I am liking that in my hallway.                                                                |
| 20:35      | And I really like the fact that it's not battery powered.                                          |
| 20:38      | So I don't have to worry about replacing the battery at any point.                                 |
| 20:42      | It will just continue working because it's plugged into a USB port.                                |
| 20:44      | And I have some spare USB ports on the plugs in my hallway.                                        |
| 20:48      | So that has been working very nicely for me.                                                       |
| 20:50      | So yeah, we'll have to experiment a little bit more with those next year and come back             |
| 20:53      | and review those.                                                                                  |
| 20:54      | Yeah, I'm thinking about the same thing for the bathroom upstairs, but they're so expensive.       |
| 20:58      | I mean, these things are like $70 or $80.                                                          |
| 21:01      | Oh, okay.                                                                                          |
| 21:02      | When I managed to get mine, I think I got them for about 40 euros each.                            |
| 21:06      | So yeah, obviously I got them on a good sale.                                                      |
| 21:10      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 21:11      | Well, hopefully next year they get less expensive.                                                 |
| 21:13      | Hopefully.                                                                                         |
| 21:14      | Yeah.                                                                                              |
| 21:15      | All right.                                                                                         |
| 21:16      | One more.                                                                                          |
| 21:17      | Let's do one more automation round together.                                                       |
| 21:21      | And I just wanted to do kind of following up on that four o'clock alarm that goes off              |
| 21:28      | is what I call the shutdown automation.                                                            |
| 21:30      | And so at the end of the day, and after I finish going through with the email and things,          |
| 21:35      | I try to shut the day down and go through and make sure everything is just kind of ready           |
| 21:40      | for the next day.                                                                                  |
| 21:42      | But I push a button on my Stream Deck, and I could do this on the time trigger.                    |
| 21:47      | Maybe there's better ways to do it, but I like the physicality of pushing the button.              |
| 21:50      | But then it just runs a [[Keyboard Maestro]] script.                                                   |
| 21:53      | Then it does clear out all my windows.                                                             |
| 21:56      | It opens up the Fantastical on the left side and OmniFocus on the right side.                    |
| 22:02      | And it sets me up to just finish the day and look at any unfinished tasks, any uncompleted         |
| 22:09      | events, and just kind of gives me a nice, clean screen.                                            |
| 22:13      | I also do a little bit of analog journal at the same time.                                         |
| 22:15      | I pull that out.                                                                                   |
| 22:16      | But I really like the idea, and we're going to do more on this next year on the show.              |
| 22:22      | But the idea of these setups and how they help your brain contextually shift so nicely.            |
| 22:28      | And one of my favourite ones, we're at the end of the year, so I'm talking about the                |
| 22:31      | end of my day.                                                                                     |
| 22:32      | The shutdown setup script, to me, is one of my favourite automations, because it means              |
| 22:38      | I made it to the end of the day and I got my work done, now I can go play.                         |
| 22:42      | Mm-hmm.                                                                                            |
| 22:43      | Yeah, that is really nice.                                                                         |
| 22:45      | I have been working at the other end of the day, literally, exactly the other end of the           |
| 22:49      | day, actually.                                                                                     |
| 22:50      | I have been working on what happens in the morning routine, and specifically what happens          |
| 22:56      | from an automation perspective.                                                                    |
| 22:57      | So one of the things I have my machine do is it'll close out windows and things.                   |
| 23:04      | So for some applications, it can close out windows, other applications, because I could            |
| 23:09      | have stuff that's important and open in those applications.                                        |
| 23:13      | It just hides all of the windows, and then it'll make sure that there are certain applications     |
| 23:19      | open and running for me, and pop open my task list for the day, and so on.                         |
| 23:24      | And at the same time, it will also assess the light level in my office.                            |
| 23:27      | Yes, folks, I've been playing a lot with light sensors recently, and I've really been fine         |
| 23:32      | tuning my usage of them, and it'll set up the lighting in my office to be nice and warm            |
| 23:38      | and cosy, so I'm not immediately thrust into bright blueish white lights.                          |
| 23:43      | First thing in the morning, that's a bit too much for me, so yeah, it will do that.                |
| 23:48      | And yeah, I've also been fuzzling with some things, so if I'm likely to be running out             |
| 23:56      | of certain items on my shopping list, some things just get added on a certain basis automatically, |
| 24:02      | and there are other things where I have them for breakfast, and so I have a little prompt          |
| 24:08      | sent to me at 10 o'clock in the morning after I've added something, three weeks or so after        |
| 24:14      | I've added something to the shopping list saying, hey, do you want this to the shopping            |
| 24:17      | list again?                                                                                        |
| 24:18      | Yes or no?                                                                                         |
| 24:19      | It's just a little list of things in [[Data Jar]], which I've been playing with, and that's            |
| 24:22      | been a real help to my morning routine, because it just makes the day smoother, and then at        |
| 24:26      | the end of the day, I can see, okay, I have a bunch of things on the grocery list, I need          |
| 24:30      | to go shopping, and my list is done, because it's been taken care of throughout the day.           |
| 24:35      | And when I sit down at my computer in the morning, I can see these are the things that             |
| 24:39      | you need to do today for work, and these are the things that you need to do today personally,      |
| 24:42      | and here is your agenda for the day.                                                               |
| 24:44      | By the way, don't forget, you've got a podcast recording at five o'clock or six o'clock,           |
| 24:47      | whatever it is, so having those things popped in front of my face in a not intrusive manner        |
| 24:54      | makes it a really nice, easy way to start my day.                                                  |
| 24:57      | All right, we're going to keep this one short, happy new year, everybody, I hope you have          |
| 25:01      | a great one for the Automator's Max listeners, Rose and I have a couple more automations           |
| 25:07      | that are related to New Year's Eve that we want to share with you, so stick around for             |
| 25:11      | that.                                                                                              |
| 25:12      | Otherwise, happy new year, and we'll see you next time.                                            |
| 25:15      | Have a lovely time, folks, and we look forward to celebrating with more automations next           |
| 25:20      | year.                                                                                              |

| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators,                                 |
| 00:04      | the automation podcast about making all of your devices,          |
| 00:06      | do everything for you,                                            |
| 00:07      | and even letting you have some fun with them.                     |
| 00:09      | My name is Rosemary Orchard,                                      |
| 00:10      | and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                         |
| 00:12      | Hey, David, how are you today?                                    |
| 00:14      | I am great, Rose, and so happy to be here talking to you.         |
| 00:17      | We haven't done a show for a little while                         |
| 00:19      | just because of scheduling things,                                |
| 00:21      | so it's always fun talking to Rosemary,                           |
| 00:23      | and we have the guests at the end of the universe                 |
| 00:26      | with us today.                                                    |
| 00:27      | Welcome to the show, Daniel Jalkut.                              |
| 00:30      | Thank you, it's great to be here.                                 |
| 00:31      | Well, this was a little bit of scheduling hijinks,                |
| 00:34      | getting here this time,                                           |
| 00:36      | so I'm really glad it's working out,                              |
| 00:37      | and there's no loud construction going on outside my doors,       |
| 00:41      | and everything seems to be coming up.                             |
| 00:43      | Rose has no pun intended.                                         |
| 00:45      | Yeah, well, I mean, Rose,                                         |
| 00:46      | just to give you a little backstage again,                        |
| 00:49      | Daniel is an automator,                                           |
| 00:51      | but he's also a developer,                                        |
| 00:52      | and he developed one of our favourite apps, Fast Scripts,          |
| 00:55      | which, you know, I believe,                                       |
| 00:56      | I think you may have sponsored us at one point,                   |
| 00:59      | but that's not why we're here.                                    |
| 01:01      | We don't do that,                                                 |
| 01:02      | but Daniel's a friend who makes a great automation app,           |
| 01:05      | and we thought, we got to get Daniel                              |
| 01:06      | on to talk about Fast Scripts,                                    |
| 01:08      | and then Daniel's house started getting constructed upon,         |
| 01:12      | and it just took a long time,                                     |
| 01:13      | but we did it, and we're here, gang,                              |
| 01:15      | and we've got a great show in store for you today.                |
| 01:17      | Sounds great, let's do a great show.                              |
| 01:20      | Yeah, it's going to be the best show                              |
| 01:23      | in the history of podcasting.                                     |
| 01:25      | I think that's the plan.                                          |
| 01:27      | That was my promise, so we'll see.                                |
| 01:28      | Well, I think we've got a pretty good place to get started,       |
| 01:32      | because not only are you the creator of Fast Scripts,             |
| 01:34      | but if you go to Red Sweater Software,                            |
| 01:37      | then you can have a poke around,                                  |
| 01:38      | and there's all sorts of goodies there.                           |
| 01:41      | Everything from Mars Edit, my favourite blog editor,               |
| 01:43      | that if only I were not using Jekyll I could use,                 |
| 01:47      | to obviously Fast Scripts and much more,                          |
| 01:50      | but how did you get started in automation?                        |
| 01:52      | Because obviously you're here now, you're a developer,            |
| 01:54      | you're not just automating things,                                |
| 01:55      | you're creating automation tools,                                 |
| 01:58      | but where did this all begin?                                     |
| 02:00      | Oh, man, I can't imagine a life without automation.               |
| 02:04      | So I guess if I think back,                                       |
| 02:07      | my dad was a software engineer,                                   |
| 02:10      | and so I was introduced to the idea of programming                |
| 02:13      | very, very young.                                                 |
| 02:16      | My memory is six or seven,                                        |
| 02:20      | starting to just point me at the idea                             |
| 02:23      | of computer instructions and following the flow of logic,         |
| 02:27      | and I remember really also being pretty young,                    |
| 02:32      | my dad doing some things at the time that were automation,        |
| 02:36      | things, I don't know if I can remember the exact things,          |
| 02:39      | but I remember him just kind of like celebrating                  |
| 02:43      | the idea of writing a computer program,                           |
| 02:45      | and this was at a time when I don't think                         |
| 02:47      | there were any real popular automation technologies.              |
| 02:51      | We weren't on the Mac at that point either,                       |
| 02:53      | we were on a Commodore Amiga,                                     |
| 02:55      | but just the idea that you could harness the power                |
| 02:58      | of a computer to make something tedious, less tedious,            |
| 03:03      | is I think every programmer by nature is an automator,            |
| 03:09      | and what the folks listening                                      |
| 03:12      | who don't consider themselves programmers,                        |
| 03:15      | I think should appreciate is that very instinct they have         |
| 03:19      | to make these tedious things less tedious                         |
| 03:21      | is exactly what drives every programmer,                          |
| 03:24      | and a lot of automation is programming, it's just,                |
| 03:29      | so my memory goes back real far,                                  |
| 03:33      | always trying to find the easy way out basically,                 |
| 03:36      | this is a cliche, but a lot of programmers                        |
| 03:40      | like to say they're lazy,                                         |
| 03:41      | I bet a lot of automators don't count themselves                  |
| 03:43      | as programmers claim to be lazy,                                  |
| 03:46      | although there's also the classic pitfall                         |
| 03:49      | that we will spend like six hours automating a five minute        |
| 03:53      | task, as long as it gets us out of having to do                   |
| 03:57      | that five minute task even one additional time,                   |
| 04:01      | but yeah, it's my mindset,                                        |
| 04:03      | I like to, in general, in life,                                   |
| 04:08      | I like to look at things, optimise them,                          |
| 04:11      | make them better, more efficient,                                 |
| 04:14      | this comes to things like I'm thinking about the fact             |
| 04:18      | that I'm perhaps like overly proud of my method                   |
| 04:22      | for making coffee in the morning,                                 |
| 04:25      | where I haven't figured out how to pour the water in              |
| 04:31      | and start the coffee maker before I scoop the coffee,             |
| 04:37      | because I know the timing so that I won't end up                  |
| 04:41      | with water coming out of the coffee maker                         |
| 04:43      | before the scoops are in there,                                   |
| 04:45      | and I just feel proud of those things,                            |
| 04:48      | and I think that's what automators feel                           |
| 04:50      | when they've shaved a few seconds off of something                |
| 04:54      | or made something just feel a little better to do,                |
| 04:57      | you don't even have to necessarily save time,                     |
| 05:00      | but just making the process feel better,                          |
| 05:03      | and I think that's something a lot of people overlook,            |
| 05:05      | automation, it kind of gets at that joke about like,              |
| 05:09      | well, you spend all this time to automate something               |
| 05:10      | that didn't take that long anyway,                                |
| 05:12      | a lot of it is just making your environment                       |
| 05:15      | more comfortable to you,                                          |
| 05:17      | and that's kind of my approach to all of the use                  |
| 05:20      | of all technology.                                                |
| 05:21      | You know, it's funny, Daniel,                                     |
| 05:23      | I've never really thought about that, but I am like you,          |
| 05:25      | I like when I scramble an egg,                                    |
| 05:27      | I have a very specific order I do it in,                          |
| 05:30      | and it's the most efficient order,                                |
| 05:32      | and the way the dishes get washed, the egg gets scrambled,        |
| 05:35      | everything gets done, specific order.                             |
| 05:37      | Same thing, when I feed the dog,                                  |
| 05:39      | the order that I get the food out,                                |
| 05:41      | and you know, the way I do it all,                                |
| 05:44      | I have like automated that process,                               |
| 05:46      | and I think it's almost,                                          |
| 05:49      | I think a lot of people listening                                 |
| 05:50      | will relate to this, right?                                       |
| 05:51      | I mean, if you've got the mindset                                 |
| 05:53      | that you're going to be interested in automation,                 |
| 05:56      | you can't help but bring it                                       |
| 05:57      | into the analog world with you.                                   |
| 05:59      | Yeah, and I think there's kind of a sense                         |
| 06:01      | of like everything in its right place.                            |
| 06:04      | Recently, this past season,                                       |
| 06:06      | I have started taking ice skating lessons,                        |
| 06:10      | and it really started to give me an appreciation                  |
| 06:13      | for how you can kind of be in accord with your environment,       |
| 06:18      | right?                                                            |
| 06:19      | So like most people who have ever ice skated,                     |
| 06:24      | my experience before was get on the ice skates,                   |
| 06:27      | kind of clumsily step over to the ice,                            |
| 06:30      | and then hope for dear God, you don't fall, right?                |
| 06:33      | And just kind of try to move forward.                             |
| 06:35      | And the lessons sort of taught me how to be in the right          |
| 06:40      | posture to sort of like harness the power of the ice.             |
| 06:44      | And that way, I kind of think there's something to that           |
| 06:48      | with this idea of like,                                           |
| 06:51      | scrambling the eggs the right way.                                |
| 06:53      | And it makes me appreciate, for instance,                         |
| 06:55      | like I bet you could interview a dancer                           |
| 06:59      | and the dancer would understand the idea                          |
| 07:03      | that moving their body in a certain way                           |
| 07:06      | feels like the most efficient way to do,                          |
| 07:08      | to achieve what they're trying to do.                             |
| 07:11      | So there's something really kind of,                              |
| 07:12      | I think philosophical at the root of all this.                    |
| 07:16      | Yeah, I mean, David Allen mentioned this in GTD,                  |
| 07:19      | that he's got a section,                                          |
| 07:21      | at least in the original book about flow theory,                  |
| 07:22      | it's like a mental state where you're just performing             |
| 07:25      | optimally and you're absorbed by your tasks.                      |
| 07:27      | And I always thought of it as like,                               |
| 07:29      | you have a little sense of satisfaction                           |
| 07:31      | in what you're doing as well of,                                  |
| 07:32      | it doesn't feel clunky.                                           |
| 07:34      | And that for me is where a lot of automation comes in,            |
| 07:37      | because I can do things,                                          |
| 07:39      | like I can go and move these files into this folder               |
| 07:41      | and rename them all with this prefix.                             |
| 07:44      | I can do that manually and it doesn't take me very long.          |
| 07:47      | But having to do it feels kind of clunky                          |
| 07:50      | and I end up doing things like,                                   |
| 07:51      | well, let's just open the folder automatically and stuff.         |
| 07:53      | And then, before I know it,                                       |
| 07:55      | I've actually done the thing                                      |
| 07:57      | where I've just got it to rename the files.                       |
| 07:58      | And then because I like to check on my work,                      |
| 08:00      | it just opens the folder afterwards.                              |
| 08:02      | And it's like, hey, by the way, I did the thing for you.          |
| 08:05      | Here you go.                                                      |
| 08:06      | There's just a sense of satisfaction going,                       |
| 08:08      | oh, it did that thing.                                            |
| 08:09      | And not only did it do that thing,                                |
| 08:11      | it did it exactly the way I like it to be done.                   |
| 08:13      | So even if I'm not completely with it                             |
| 08:15      | as it's going through doing things,                               |
| 08:17      | like it's accurate, even if I'm not on the ball                   |
| 08:19      | because I've taken the time to set that up.                       |
| 08:21      | So it can let me, slack off is the wrong word,                    |
| 08:24      | but relax a little bit and focus on other things.                 |
| 08:28      | And at the end, you get to say,                                   |
| 08:30      | yep, nailed it again.                                             |
| 08:32      | There I go.                                                       |
| 08:33      | So you get to feel the satisfaction of doing it perfectly,        |
| 08:37      | which I do think is something that feeds a lot of this too.       |
| 08:40      | And I bet it feeds the dancer                                     |
| 08:41      | and it feeds the ice skater too.                                  |
| 08:43      | I do think that also the comment you made earlier                 |
| 08:47      | about how all programmers are automators,                         |
| 08:50      | I would argue that all automators are programmers too.            |
| 08:53      | If you're going to do this stuff,                                 |
| 08:55      | I mean, they're hopefully not too complicated,                    |
| 08:58      | but sometimes they get complicated too.                           |
| 09:00      | But a lot of automators like do a level of program.               |
| 09:04      | It's not the same thing that you'll do                            |
| 09:06      | when you're working at Apple or making an app,                    |
| 09:09      | but it is a level of programming.                                 |
| 09:11      | And it takes that kind of mindset,                                |
| 09:13      | the logical progression,                                          |
| 09:16      | because the computers are not very smart, right?                  |
| 09:18      | We've got to tell them exactly what order to do things.           |
| 09:20      | And it takes that kind of mindset                                 |
| 09:22      | in order to be a good automator.                                  |
| 09:24      | Yeah, I think a key way to think about that                       |
| 09:27      | is whatever tool you're using for automation                      |
| 09:30      | at the time may not have the depth or breadth                     |
| 09:34      | to automate things using the same techniques                      |
| 09:38      | and strategy that you would with, say, a more advanced tool       |
| 09:42      | like let's say the Swift programming language.                    |
| 09:44      | It may not have that depth and breadth,                           |
| 09:46      | but whatever you do in shortcuts or automator                     |
| 09:51      | or whatever your script,                                          |
| 09:57      | something simpler than what you're doing today                    |
| 10:01      | can be done in a more advanced tool.                              |
| 10:04      | So that is to say, whatever it is you're doing,                   |
| 10:07      | you could probably already,                                       |
| 10:08      | you're already capable of doing the same kind of thing            |
| 10:12      | in a more advanced tool.                                          |
| 10:13      | It's just that the more advanced tools also offer you             |
| 10:16      | the ability to expand beyond that skill set.                      |
| 10:21      | Yeah, yes.                                                        |
| 10:22      | And a lot of this stuff is about the logic behind it.             |
| 10:26      | What is the problem that you're trying to solve                   |
| 10:28      | and how do you get from A to B?                                   |
| 10:30      | And do you also do C as well?                                     |
| 10:33      | And that's a good chunk of it.                                    |
| 10:35      | And oftentimes tools like Keyboard Maestro                        |
| 10:38      | or Shortcuts abstract some of the difficulties involved.          |
| 10:41      | I spent a good 15 minutes earlier today                           |
| 10:44      | attempting to read some specific files with Python.               |
| 10:47      | And it turned out the entire thing                                |
| 10:48      | was that I was in the wrong location                              |
| 10:50      | and so it was reading from the wrong path.                        |
| 10:51      | Of course it was, something very, very simple.                    |
| 10:55      | But that's the sort of thing                                      |
| 10:56      | where something like Shortcuts makes that a lot easier.           |
| 10:59      | And so you don't have to futz around with stuff like that,        |
| 11:03      | which can often put people off of these things.                   |
| 11:06      | Because if it takes 15 minutes for a programmer                   |
| 11:10      | to read a file in the end,                                        |
| 11:13      | admittedly a half asleep programmer at the time,                  |
| 11:16      | then how long is it going to take somebody                        |
| 11:17      | who doesn't know that programming language?                       |
| 11:21      | And that's difficult,                                             |
| 11:22      | but a lot of tools make it a lot easier.                          |
| 11:24      | And it's really good that we have those as options                |
| 11:27      | and that everybody listening to this is a programmer.             |
| 11:29      | If you've ever created a Shortcut,                                |
| 11:31      | even if it's just one action, congratulations,                    |
| 11:33      | you get a little gold star.                                       |
| 11:34      | I totally agree with that.                                        |
| 11:36      | And I'm also in the camp of people                                |
| 11:37      | who is persistently trying to convince everybody,                 |
| 11:40      | I know that if they want to become a quote unquote programmer,    |
| 11:45      | the more universally accepted form of programmer,                 |
| 11:49      | then it's open to you.                                            |
| 11:51      | And I know some people just feel                                  |
| 11:52      | like they don't have the mind for it or whatever.                 |
| 11:54      | But trust me, if you are thinking in terms of automation          |
| 11:58      | at all, then you have the mind for it.                            |
| 12:00      | It's just a matter of like everything else                        |
| 12:02      | overcoming the learning curve.                                    |
| 12:04      | I mean, when I started,                                           |
| 12:06      | I was into programming a lot more as a kid.                       |
| 12:08      | As I've grown up, I never grew up.                                |
| 12:12      | But as I got older, I've kind of just kind of adopted,            |
| 12:16      | well, the level of programming I want to dive into                |
| 12:19      | is automation.                                                    |
| 12:20      | I don't want to go further.                                       |
| 12:21      | I've got other things I want to do.                               |
| 12:23      | But when I was a kid, it was really hard                          |
| 12:25      | because it was assembly code.                                     |
| 12:27      | I started on an Atari.                                            |
| 12:28      | You started on an Amiga.                                          |
| 12:29      | But you were really, you were writing binary                      |
| 12:34      | into your computer to make it do anything interesting.            |
| 12:38      | Like if you tried to write it in basic, it was so slow.           |
| 12:41      | But now those tools are much easier for people.                   |
| 12:44      | And that's why you've got kids going through middle school,       |
| 12:47      | making really great apps.                                         |
| 12:49      | And I agree with you that's out there.                            |
| 12:52      | But also the flip side of that is,                                |
| 12:53      | and if you're listening to the show saying,                       |
| 12:55      | well, I don't want to become a programmer, that's okay.           |
| 12:57      | You can just be an automator and that's all right.                |
| 13:00      | My point is that you have a programmer's kind of mindset          |
| 13:04      | when you come to it.                                              |
| 13:04      | But whether you use this as your gateway drug                     |
| 13:08      | to become the next great programmer                               |
| 13:10      | or just a way to get your work done a little faster,              |
| 13:14      | I really think that this is something                             |
| 13:16      | you should be exploring.                                          |
| 13:18      | And we'll just call you a programmer behind your back.            |
| 13:20      | There you go, exactly.                                            |
| 13:21      | Yeah, but it's definitely a positive, not a negative.             |
| 13:26      | That's right.                                                     |
| 13:27      | But so you started doing automation as a kid                      |
| 13:30      | and at some point you went beyond automation.                     |
| 13:33      | You began programming computers                                   |
| 13:36      | and tell us just a little bit about your journey there.           |
| 13:39      | Yeah, so I mentioned how my dad was a programmer                  |
| 13:42      | and when I think back and when I tell that story                  |
| 13:46      | about how early I was exposed to programming,                     |
| 13:48      | people often assume I must have been programming myself           |
| 13:52      | shortly after, but it was a sort of a combination                 |
| 13:58      | of my dad not pushing programming on me                           |
| 14:01      | and my own interests not really emphasising that.                 |
| 14:08      | So just to say, in stark contrast to some people                  |
| 14:11      | who grew up with parents who programmed,                           |
| 14:14      | I didn't end up really programming that much                      |
| 14:17      | until I was much older.                                           |
| 14:19      | When I say much older, I mean like 16.                            |
| 14:23      | So I spent most of my childhood not programming                   |
| 14:28      | even though I had computers, ranging from first computer,         |
| 14:34      | I remember my dad having was a K-Pro,                             |
| 14:37      | had Commodore Amiga's, Commodore 64 before that.                  |
| 14:42      | And I remember cracking open,                                     |
| 14:45      | this is also something I try to remember to remind people         |
| 14:47      | because at this point I'm not modest,                             |
| 14:50      | I am a really good programmer, okay?                              |
| 14:51      | I'm an adult, I've learned over 20 plus years                     |
| 14:55      | of programming how to be good at it.                              |
| 14:58      | But when I was a teenager and I opened the Commodore 64           |
| 15:02      | basic manual, I remember just getting perplexed                   |
| 15:07      | at the go sub instruction,                                        |
| 15:10      | which is like the basic instruction to call a sub routine.        |
| 15:13      | And so in the long story short,                                   |
| 15:16      | I never learned how to program the Commodore 64,                  |
| 15:18      | I never really learned how to program basic at all.               |
| 15:21      | And it was because I was overwhelmed.                             |
| 15:22      | I had the book, I had a dad who could have helped me,             |
| 15:25      | I had resources and I felt like I couldn't do it.                 |
| 15:30      | And it is a sort of testament I think                             |
| 15:34      | to coming back to something,                                      |
| 15:37      | even things that you think maybe you couldn't do                  |
| 15:39      | because as it happened,                                           |
| 15:41      | what finally motivated me to learn to program                     |
| 15:44      | was getting my first Mac.                                         |
| 15:46      | And like I said, before my Mac, my first Mac,                     |
| 15:50      | I did a little bit of programming on Unix                         |
| 15:53      | because I was part of like a university Unix community.           |
| 15:56      | And so I did a little bit of C programming on Unix.               |
| 15:59      | And then I got a Mac and the idea of like it is                   |
| 16:03      | for so many kids, the idea of making a game took over.            |
| 16:08      | And a game with graphics.                                         |
| 16:11      | So there's an app I wrote that is,                                |
| 16:18      | some of you might remember this game style from Unix              |
| 16:23      | and I think it's been adapted to other platforms                  |
| 16:25      | by other people, but it's basically,                              |
| 16:27      | it's usually called Daleks and it's a robot type game             |
| 16:30      | where you just kind of make, you know,                            |
| 16:33      | inspired by Doctor Who's Daleks.                                  |
| 16:35      | It's just like you move around                                    |
| 16:37      | and try to make the robots crash into each other.                 |
| 16:40      | This was a Unix game that I used to play                          |
| 16:42      | on this Unix community.                                           |
| 16:44      | And when I first got my PowerBook Duo 210,                        |
| 16:50      | it was my first Mac that I owned                                  |
| 16:52      | and could use for myself, my family was not a Mac family.         |
| 16:55      | So I brought my family kicking and screaming                      |
| 16:58      | into the Apple ecosystem, but I got my first Mac                  |
| 17:02      | and I thought this has graphics                                   |
| 17:03      | and I need to learn how to program it.                            |
| 17:06      | And so I got this great app on the Mac at that time.              |
| 17:11      | First of all, there was a compiler called Think C                 |
| 17:14      | and there was this great app called Think Reference.              |
| 17:17      | And it was just from a time,                                      |
| 17:18      | it's kind of like the equivalent                                  |
| 17:19      | of like the Dash documentation app today.                         |
| 17:23      | I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's cool.         |
| 17:27      | But it's just basically like a nice,                              |
| 17:28      | like hyperlink based, you know, documentation thing.              |
| 17:32      | And I just tried to read everything I could                       |
| 17:34      | about the Mac toolbox at that time.                               |
| 17:36      | And I wrote my first game and I put it out there                  |
| 17:38      | as shareware and I think I was, you know,                         |
| 17:43      | maybe 17 or something at the time.                                |
| 17:46      | And that got me started.                                          |
| 17:47      | And after that, I was committed to the Mac                        |
| 17:52      | and it's sort of just a fast track.                               |
| 17:55      | Like I said, I didn't learn to program until kind of late         |
| 17:59      | for a programmer's son,                                           |
| 18:01      | but by within a few years,                                        |
| 18:04      | I was working at my first job at Apple                            |
| 18:07      | as a quality engineer, a tester                                   |
| 18:11      | and managed to just get into the right doors                      |
| 18:15      | to end up programming for the System 7 team.                      |
| 18:20      | And that's it, that's the story.                                  |
| 18:22      | So anyway, see you next week.                                     |
| 18:25      | I mean, but that really goes to show, you know,                   |
| 18:27      | that just because you've got, you know,                           |
| 18:29      | parents who can do this and, you know,                            |
| 18:31      | you had the ability to learn, you don't have to learn it,         |
| 18:34      | you know, right from, you know, the age of being knee high,       |
| 18:36      | you can learn programming whenever you want                       |
| 18:38      | and then, you know, become great at it                            |
| 18:40      | as you obviously are because of all the apps                      |
| 18:42      | that you've created and are running and supporting today.         |
| 18:45      | Right.                                                            |
| 18:46      | And then sometimes I think about that, you know,                  |
| 18:48      | I don't want to diminish the impact my dad                        |
| 18:51      | in particular had on me, but like I said already, you know,       |
| 18:56      | you know, I didn't really use that resource much,                 |
| 18:59      | but I think just having a dad who was so steeped                  |
| 19:03      | in programming, knowing, it kind of demystified it, right?        |
| 19:07      | Like if you, if you were like a shoemaker's daughter              |
| 19:13      | and somebody says to you, like,                                   |
| 19:17      | shoemaking is impossible.                                         |
| 19:19      | Like how would anybody even start?                                |
| 19:20      | You might have like the sense like, well, actually, you know,     |
| 19:24      | take these things and they stitch them together                   |
| 19:25      | and this is how it works,                                         |
| 19:27      | even though maybe you had never tried to make a shoe.             |
| 19:31      | So when the time came that I wanted to program,                   |
| 19:34      | you know, it's like so many people emphasise these days           |
| 19:37      | of giving kids role models.                                       |
| 19:39      | Well, I had a role model, you know, I had a role model            |
| 19:42      | that I could step into the shoes of, so to speak.                 |
| 19:45      | And yeah, I'm grateful that I did                                 |
| 19:47      | because it turns out, turns out I like programming.               |
| 19:50      | And I didn't even know that I was gonna like programming          |
| 19:53      | frankly until after I went to college.                            |
| 19:56      | I didn't know what I was gonna do.                                |
| 19:59      | And luckily, I think I ended up doing what I like.                |
| 20:03      | So is that like a good news bad thing,                            |
| 20:05      | news thing for your dad's like,                                   |
| 20:06      | goodness is Daniel's into programming, the bad news is            |
| 20:09      | he's became one of those Mac weirdos.                             |
| 20:13      | It was for sure.                                                  |
| 20:14      | And we used to have these annoying debates about the Mac          |
| 20:18      | because he was just so steeped in this like anti-Mac rhetoric.    |
| 20:23      | He was like, you know, among the,                                 |
| 20:25      | he was a compiler engineer                                        |
| 20:26      | and none of his compiler friends used Macs.                       |
| 20:30      | So all of the like hyperbole about Macs being toys                |
| 20:35      | and this and that and the other thing.                            |
| 20:37      | And I'll tell you what,                                           |
| 20:38      | this is perfect for the automators show                           |
| 20:40      | because my dad at some point grudgingly,                          |
| 20:44      | I think what happened is after I was working at Apple             |
| 20:46      | for a while, he was sort of proud enough of me working            |
| 20:49      | at Apple that he thought maybe he should get a Mac                |
| 20:51      | just like be play for the home team.                              |
| 20:54      | And they got a Mac and being a programmer that he is,             |
| 20:58      | he started getting, he bought like an [[AppleScript]] book.          |
| 21:03      | And it was such a great testament to AppleScript                 |
| 21:07      | that my dad, like a C++ compiler engineer,                        |
| 21:12      | one day he pulled me aside and he just said,                      |
| 21:14      | I finally took a look at this AppleScript language.              |
| 21:18      | I just thought it was going to be so basic,                       |
| 21:21      | but it's a real programming language.                             |
| 21:24      | And I was like, yes, you get it.                                  |
| 21:26      | Like this is, and that was a great testament to him               |
| 21:31      | sort of finding a route to respecting Apple and the Mac           |
| 21:36      | was through AppleScript of all things.                           |
| 21:39      | And I didn't know how, at that time,                              |
| 21:40      | I didn't know how to use AppleScript at all,                     |
| 21:42      | but this must have been in, you know, 96 or something             |
| 21:45      | a couple of years after AppleScript had come out.                |
| 21:47      | And now one of your primary products                              |
| 21:49      | is AppleScript related, which is kind of fun.                    |
| 21:50      | Right, that's right.                                              |
| 21:52      | Yeah, I really feel like AppleScript                             |
| 21:55      | doesn't get a fair shake from a lot of people.                    |
| 21:58      | I mean, I get that it's not like a traditional programming        |
| 22:01      | language and it's, you know, the syntax is weird, you know,       |
| 22:07      | it's supposed to be more natural language                         |
| 22:09      | and, you know, making things more natural language                |
| 22:12      | sometimes makes them more difficult,                              |
| 22:13      | particularly for traditional programmers,                         |
| 22:17      | for non-programmers, it might make their life easier.             |
| 22:21      | But for people who are used to very specific language             |
| 22:24      | to declare a variable, it can make them crazy.                    |
| 22:27      | But I understand where they were coming from.                     |
| 22:30      | And I feel like that was one of the early tips                    |
| 22:34      | to bring automation to the masses.                                |
| 22:37      | Yeah, well, and the thing is, for people who aren't               |
| 22:40      | in programmer cultures, every language is reviled by somebody.    |
| 22:46      | And the people who reviled the language                           |
| 22:48      | are usually pretty vocal about it.                                |
| 22:50      | And it's funny to think about languages like PHP,                 |
| 22:54      | JavaScript, C++, Perl,                                           |
| 22:59      | four of like the most popular languages in history                |
| 23:01      | are some of the most reviled languages, right?                    |
| 23:04      | They have, people have pejoratives                                |
| 23:06      | for all of these languages.                                       |
| 23:08      | And in JavaScript in particular, I think most people              |
| 23:12      | would agree is the most universally adopted language now.         |
| 23:16      | And people still ridicule it for all of its shortcomings.         |
| 23:21      | So sometimes I like to think, you know,                           |
| 23:24      | AppleScript has plenty to ridicule it for,                        |
| 23:28      | but, you know, there is a like parallel universe                  |
| 23:31      | where AppleScript took off and became so popular                  |
| 23:34      | that it was like the language powering the web.                   |
| 23:38      | And then people would still be ridiculing it                      |
| 23:41      | and, you know, glorifying all of the things                       |
| 23:44      | that are wrong with it,                                           |
| 23:45      | but it would still be hugely successful.                          |
| 23:47      | So it's like, you know, it's kind of easy                         |
| 23:49      | to beat up on AppleScript because not only does it have           |
| 23:53      | a lot of peculiarities that are different                         |
| 23:55      | from other languages, it makes it difficult                       |
| 23:57      | in some ways for programmers and non-programmers,                 |
| 24:00      | but it's also not that popular.                                   |
| 24:02      | So it's sort of low stakes to beat up on it.                      |
| 24:06      | Yeah, but then there are people that you meet                     |
| 24:09      | that can do amazing things with it.                               |
| 24:12      | And we still hear from automated listeners                        |
| 24:14      | who are now learning AppleScript                                  |
| 24:17      | because they're primarily working on the Mac                      |
| 24:21      | and they want to get the most out of automation on the Mac.       |
| 24:24      | And I think it's a good option.                                   |
| 24:26      | I mean, so long as you're staying on the Mac,                     |
| 24:28      | once you get on the mobile,                                       |
| 24:29      | you're not gonna get anything with AppleScript.                   |
| 24:32      | But I stand by the belief that Apple is not going                 |
| 24:35      | to remove AppleScript from the Mac.                               |
| 24:37      | I don't need, I think it would require effort                     |
| 24:40      | on their behalf to do so.                                         |
| 24:42      | And as a result, it's in there.                                   |
| 24:45      | I think it would take dynamite to get AppleScript                 |
| 24:47      | out of the Mac OS at this point.                                  |
| 24:49      | And I don't think anybody's willing to blow stuff up.             |
| 24:52      | Yeah, so it's a perfect example of something                      |
| 24:54      | that you can, I think, pretty respectfully be confident           |
| 25:00      | will not go away and be confident will get no care.               |
| 25:04      | It's like, it's going to age out,                                 |
| 25:08      | maybe not even gracefully, right?                                 |
| 25:10      | It's just gonna go away over whatever the course of time          |
| 25:15      | is that it naturally stops being used                             |
| 25:18      | and people move on to other things.                               |
| 25:21      | Maybe that will be shortcuts to a large extent                    |
| 25:23      | if Apple continues to invest in shortcuts.                        |
| 25:26      | Maybe it'll be JavaScript-based automations.                      |
| 25:29      | But I agree, the thing is some of the best things                 |
| 25:36      | about AppleScript actually are the ways                           |
| 25:39      | that it imposed on, and it still does impose                      |
| 25:43      | on programmers who support it at the app level.                   |
| 25:48      | It imposes a philosophy for organising your data                  |
| 25:52      | kind of into the equivalent of a DOM                              |
| 25:55      | like in a JavaScript sense, document object model.                |
| 26:00      | It's kind of the tree hierarchy                                   |
| 26:02      | of all the contents of an app.                                    |
| 26:05      | And AppleScript did this very early on, the 90s.                  |
| 26:10      | And so what's great about that is a lot of apps                   |
| 26:14      | that do support scripting are structured in such a way            |
| 26:17      | that they can be adapted to other scripting languages             |
| 26:20      | if something else comes along.                                    |
| 26:23      | So it's kind of like the infrastructure,                          |
| 26:26      | when you talk about AppleScript,                                  |
| 26:27      | you're talking about the language,                                |
| 26:28      | but also the infrastructure.                                      |
| 26:29      | And especially the infrastructure,                                |
| 26:33      | a lot of people would probably be hard-pressed                    |
| 26:35      | to find another way to organise their existing apps,              |
| 26:39      | at least.                                                         |
| 26:40      | The other thing is, of course,                                    |
| 26:41      | shortcuts is shipped,                                             |
| 26:42      | but it shipped with AppleScript support and CLI support.          |
| 26:45      | So even though shortcuts may eventually be here                   |
| 26:49      | to eat AppleScript's lunch at the moment,                         |
| 26:51      | it's still bringing the goods.                                    |
| 26:53      | So we have everything that you would expect                       |
| 26:56      | from an automatable application in 2022.                          |
| 27:01      | This episode of Automators is brought to you                      |
| 27:03      | by our friends at TextExpander.                                   |

| 27:21      | and isn't spending time reinventing the wheel.                    |
| 27:24      | Here's how it works.                                              |
| 27:25      | First, store it.                                                  |
| 27:26      | Keep your company's most used emails, phrases, messaging,         |

| 27:31      | Then share it.                                                    |
| 27:32      | Get your whole team access to the content                         |
| 27:33      | they need to use every day,                                       |
| 27:35      | organise it by department,                                        |
| 27:36      | and finally, expand it.                                           |
| 27:38      | Deploy the content you need with just a few keystrokes            |
| 27:40      | on any device across any apps you use.                            |
| 27:43      | It's that easy,                                                   |
| 27:44      | and TextExpander is available on Mac, Windows, Chrome,            |

| 27:48      | I use TextExpander for all sorts of things,                       |
| 27:49      | but particularly in the context of teams,                         |
| 27:51      | it's really important to actually have                            |
| 27:53      | the same information everywhere.                                  |
| 27:54      | If something changes,                                             |
| 27:56      | this way, everybody's sending the same message.                   |
| 27:58      | There's no more,                                                  |
| 27:59      | this person said I could,                                         |
| 28:00      | when somebody else said that they couldn't,                       |
| 28:02      | it's all unified.                                                 |
| 28:04      | So it boosts your productivity                                    |

| 28:18      | I'll thanks to TextExpander                                       |
| 28:19      | for their support of this show and Relay FM.                     |
| 28:23      | Well, Daniel, let's fast forward now.                             |
| 28:25      | You are a programmer, you own a company,                          |
| 28:28      | you've got some great apps                                        |
| 28:29      | that have automation related products,                            |
| 28:31      | but how much do you use automation                                |
| 28:33      | in your day-to-day work?                                          |
| 28:35      | I use automation whenever I can,                                  |
| 28:37      | and I'm always trying to expand my tool set.                      |
| 28:40      | The most recent thing I could tell you about                      |
| 28:43      | that I've started working on                                      |
| 28:45      | is actually automating,                                           |
| 28:47      | it's been a long time on my list                                  |
| 28:49      | to get better at web screen scraping,                             |
| 28:53      | like to automate, in particular,                                  |
| 28:55      | I like so many other people                                       |
| 28:57      | have switched years and years ago                                 |
| 28:59      | to paperless documents.                                           |
| 29:02      | And I am so frustrated by the fact                                |
| 29:05      | that I have the simultaneous compulsion                           |
| 29:08      | to maintain an archive of all of my statements                    |
| 29:12      | from these different companies.                                   |
| 29:14      | And the total lack of interest or desire                          |
| 29:18      | in logging in and clicking around and downloading them.           |
| 29:21      | So when you ask me about what I've been automating lately,        |
| 29:24      | it doesn't happen to be an AppleScript thing,                    |
| 29:26      | but it's really interesting,                                      |
| 29:30      | because I've dipped my toe into screen scraping,                  |
| 29:36      | probably for at least 15 years.                                   |
| 29:38      | I've tried to automate things in the past,                        |
| 29:41      | as far back as I can remember, sometimes using tools              |
| 29:46      | as rudimentary as just like the curl command line tool.           |
| 29:51      | And for folks who don't maybe know, just real quickly,            |
| 29:55      | screen scraping just means trying to navigate to                  |
| 29:58      | and extract data from the web                                     |
| 30:01      | without doing it manually, basically.                             |
| 30:05      | And what I was so delighted to learn recently                     |
| 30:08      | when I started digging back into it again                         |
| 30:11      | is that Chrome in particular,                                     |
| 30:15      | this might be old news to you both,                               |
| 30:17      | but Chrome in particular has something called Headless Chrome.    |
| 30:22      | And it's a way, it's like a protocol and interface                |
| 30:25      | for interacting with the browser programmatically                 |
| 30:30      | without it even necessarily being loaded into a window.           |
| 30:34      | And then Google also has this other technology                    |
| 30:37      | called Puppeteer, which is a Python package.                      |
| 30:42      | No, it's not Python, I'm sorry.                                   |
| 30:44      | It's a mix up my scripting languages.                             |
| 30:46      | It's a node package, at least the interface I'm using             |
| 30:49      | is node, a JavaScript based.                                      |
| 30:52      | And it just gives you all these cool tools                        |
| 30:55      | for automating stuff on the web.                                  |
| 30:58      | So you can say things like open this page,                        |
| 31:01      | wait for it to finish loading, click in the text box              |
| 31:05      | that has this ID, whatever, login,                                |
| 31:09      | enter the text, Daniel, submit the form,                          |
| 31:13      | and then automate putting everything in                           |
| 31:16      | to log into a site.                                               |
| 31:17      | I've just scratched the surface,                                  |
| 31:19      | so the only reason I mentioned it                                 |
| 31:20      | is because it's so fresh in my memory,                            |
| 31:22      | but it's a really good example.                                   |
| 31:26      | I feel like [[AppleScript]], Shortcuts,                              |
| 31:30      | even Shell Scripts on the Mac,                                    |
| 31:32      | they give us the power to automate so much in the context         |
| 31:36      | of our local work environment, our desktop.                       |
| 31:39      | And that's so important, it's so powerful,                        |
| 31:41      | but I have felt frustrated by the sort of boundary                |
| 31:44      | of the web for a long time.                                       |
| 31:46      | Like I often don't feel like I can just quickly                   |
| 31:50      | throw a script together to automate something on the web.         |
| 31:53      | And I feel like maybe I'm kind of at the door,                    |
| 31:57      | at the doorstep of being able to do that                          |
| 32:00      | with this new technology.                                         |
| 32:02      | Well, just imagine somebody out there like me,                    |
| 32:05      | who's not a professional programmer,                              |
| 32:07      | and all the ways we struggle with getting data out of the web,    |
| 32:11      | because I can tell you,                                           |
| 32:12      | I've written some real janky keyboard nitro scripts               |
| 32:16      | and [[Alfred]] workflows,                                             |
| 32:18      | and I've done some really crazy stuff over the years              |
| 32:20      | to try and automation,                                            |
| 32:22      | I call it like scraping my data out of a website,                 |
| 32:26      | because they just make it so hard.                                |
| 32:28      | So this is actually very encouraging to me,                       |
| 32:31      | because I wasn't aware                                            |
| 32:32      | that there was a headless version of Chrome.                      |
| 32:36      | So how do you get started?                                        |
| 32:37      | If someone out there is listening                                 |
| 32:38      | and you've got their interest,                                    |
| 32:39      | how do you get started figuring that out?                         |
| 32:43      | Let me see if I can pull up my notes for this,                    |
| 32:47      | because I have a couple good links, I think.                      |
| 32:51      | One resource I'll recommend,                                      |
| 32:53      | while Daniel is just looking for his notes,                       |
| 32:54      | there is Selenium.                                                |
| 32:56      | Selenium is designed to be a testing tool                         |
| 32:59      | for developers of web applications,                               |
| 33:01      | where the idea is it will just go                                 |
| 33:03      | and do the same series of actions again and again,                |
| 33:05      | and when something breaks,                                        |
| 33:06      | it'll go, hey, it's broken over here,                             |
| 33:09      | without you needing to write thousands of lines of code.          |
| 33:13      | And it's quite popular for this sort of thing as well,            |
| 33:16      | because it's got a Python library that you can use,               |
| 33:22      | and it's fairly well documented,                                  |
| 33:25      | or very well documented actually,                                 |
| 33:26      | because people use this for testing.                              |
| 33:28      | But that's obviously using Python,                                |
| 33:30      | rather than JavaScript,                                           |
| 33:32      | which Daniel must be using with Puppeteer.                        |
| 33:36      | Yeah, so the thing with Puppeteer,                                |
| 33:37      | the reason I, so years ago, whenever I had tried this,            |
| 33:40      | I tried to find, at the moment,                                   |
| 33:41      | whatever the latest and greatest was,                             |
| 33:43      | and that definitely included things like Selenium.                |
| 33:46      | Included for many years, these packages,                          |
| 33:49      | people may recognise the name of Phantom.js,                      |
| 33:52      | and these were all designed to allow you                          |
| 33:57      | to run various web framework, not frameworks,                     |
| 34:02      | like the actual browser APIs.                                     |
| 34:06      | What seems to be unique about Headless Chrome                     |
| 34:10      | and Puppeteer is this emphasis on the headless aspect,            |
| 34:15      | so that you can really come up                                    |
| 34:18      | with more efficient kind of standalone scripts and stuff          |
| 34:23      | that run without even like the artefact                           |
| 34:26      | of seeing Chrome or any other browser open.                       |
| 34:29      | And Selenium might have provided that too, I can't recall,        |
| 34:33      | but there's two things I wanna mention                            |
| 34:35      | while I have everybody thinking about this.                       |
| 34:37      | The first is, let's see, Puppeteer itself,                        |
| 34:43      | you can find, I think you can just Google it,                     |
| 34:46      | because it's actually one of the other,                           |
| 34:49      | so the encouraging things about this are,                         |
| 34:51      | and I'll say, I'm not a huge Chrome fan, personally,              |
| 34:54      | I don't use Chrome, I use Safari all the time,                    |
| 34:57      | so I'm kind of like the last person                               |
| 34:59      | you'd expect to go running to Chrome,                             |
| 35:01      | but as soon as I see that there's                                 |
| 35:04      | like this screen scraping technology                              |
| 35:06      | that is basically endorsed and sponsored by Google,               |
| 35:10      | and there's a framework for automating it called Puppeteer,       |
| 35:15      | which is also by Google, I'm like, you know what?                 |
| 35:19      | I'm not gonna make, this is like,                                 |
| 35:20      | you don't get fired for hiring IBM, you know?                     |
| 35:23      | It's like, this is, just cause I don't particularly               |
| 35:28      | use Chrome, doesn't mean I won't lean on it                       |
| 35:31      | to solve this problem for me.                                     |
| 35:33      | So basically, if you Google for Puppeteer,                        |
| 35:36      | you will find it, we can put a link in the show notes             |
| 35:38      | already, yeah.                                                    |
| 35:40      | So the only other thing I wanna mention is,                       |
| 35:42      | it took me a little while, cause I got it going,                  |
| 35:44      | so one of the cool things about Puppeteer                         |
| 35:46      | and Headless Chrome is you can run it,                            |
| 35:49      | not headless while you're debugging,                              |
| 35:51      | and so you can like bring up the browser                          |
| 35:53      | and see what it's doing and try to figure out                     |
| 35:54      | how to change it, and I was having a lot of bad luck,             |
| 35:59      | cause I was trying to get it to log into my bank,                 |
| 36:01      | and it wasn't working, and then,                                  |
| 36:03      | so I discovered that Puppeteer also supports plugins,             |
| 36:07      | and there's one called plugin,                                    |
| 36:11      | it's called the Puppeteer Stealth plugin,                         |
| 36:14      | and it basically just convinces whatever website                  |
| 36:17      | you're trying to automate that it's not being automated,          |
| 36:21      | which is a great step too,                                        |
| 36:23      | and so as soon as I installed this plugin and used it,            |
| 36:25      | instead of the like baseline Puppeteer,                           |
| 36:27      | I was totally able to log into my bank                            |
| 36:30      | and do all kinds of cool things.                                  |
| 36:32      | Yeah, and that's the challenge for an automator, right,           |
| 36:34      | because these website hosts are really trying                     |
| 36:39      | to avoid people scraping data for bad reasons,                    |
| 36:41      | and that's something we don't want to have happen.                |
| 36:44      | We don't want hackers to go and pull our data off,                |
| 36:48      | I mean, a bank website is an extreme example,                     |
| 36:50      | but even just like a shopping website or a forum                  |
| 36:54      | where you like to go and participate,                             |
| 36:55      | you don't want them scraping all your data out of there,          |
| 36:58      | but as a user, it's our data,                                     |
| 37:00      | I mean, I don't wanna get into the arguments                      |
| 37:04      | about whether it's still our data                                 |
| 37:05      | once we put it on the internet,                                   |
| 37:06      | but I mean, we put it there,                                      |
| 37:08      | it's stuff that relates to us,                                    |
| 37:10      | and in general, the internet websites                             |
| 37:14      | are not very good at saying,                                      |
| 37:15      | oh, hey, it's you Sparky,                                         |
| 37:17      | and this is your bank information,                                |
| 37:19      | just push this one button                                         |
| 37:20      | and we'll give you everything you need out of the website.        |
| 37:22      | They don't give you that, you know?                               |
| 37:25      | And I wish, you know, since they don't,                           |
| 37:28      | we have to figure a way around it.                                |
| 37:30      | That's right, and I would be happy to use                         |
| 37:32      | a more secure like API or something                               |
| 37:35      | that they wanna provide,                                          |
| 37:37      | but yeah, it's like, I almost feel like, you know,                |
| 37:40      | there's this strong like right to repair movement                 |
| 37:43      | for products, and I feel like there should be like                |
| 37:45      | a right to API for your data, you know,                           |
| 37:49      | there's all this great stuff, you know,                           |
| 37:51      | the widely like sort of lamented,                                 |
| 37:55      | what is it, the GDPR? GDPR, yep.                                  |
| 37:58      | Yeah, the widely lamented policies from that nonetheless          |
| 38:03      | brought us some great like data portability changes.              |
| 38:07      | And I would like to see some similar,                             |
| 38:10      | something similar that just made all these big companies          |
| 38:13      | that can afford to do it, give us an API for our data.            |
| 38:16      | But in the absence of that,                                       |
| 38:18      | this is really something fun to look into.                        |
| 38:20      | So I guess I just say it kind of as like,                         |
| 38:22      | this is what I'm jazzed about at the moment.                      |
| 38:24      | And if anyone out there like me has been waiting around           |
| 38:28      | wondering like, how the heck do I scrape web pages in 2022?       |
| 38:32      | I'm pretty confident this is one of the best approaches.          |
| 38:36      | Yes, absolutely.                                                  |
| 38:38      | Though if you live in the UK,                                     |
| 38:39      | then banks have to adhere to British legislation,                 |
| 38:43      | which means that if they're over a certain size,                  |
| 38:46      | they have to integrate with a protocol called open banking,       |
| 38:49      | which means that they have to have an API                         |
| 38:51      | that can be accessed by authorised.                               |
| 38:54      | It's not just something where anybody can sign up,                |
| 38:57      | but you know, if you go through vetting process,                  |
| 38:59      | you can then sign up to get access                                |
| 39:01      | and authenticate yourself and get data out of your bank,          |
| 39:06      | which is pretty cool.                                             |
| 39:07      | So maybe at some point that will spread out.                      |
| 39:10      | There's a similar piece of legislation in Europe,                 |
| 39:12      | though it doesn't explicitly say open banking.                    |
| 39:15      | It allows people to use a couple of different APIs,               |
| 39:19      | but it's pretty good that data portability                        |
| 39:22      | is becoming more of a thing.                                      |
| 39:23      | And I'm very amused by puppeteer stealth                          |
| 39:26      | because for years, and I still have it now,                       |
| 39:28      | ICAP is one of my favourite applications                           |
| 39:31      | that I keep installed on my iPad and my iPhone,                   |
| 39:33      | and I very rarely use.                                            |
| 39:34      | But what I do when I'm using it is I've set it                    |
| 39:37      | so that the browser profile is Firefox on Windows.                |
| 39:40      | Because this nearly always gets around the,                       |
| 39:43      | oh, we've detected you're using an iPad,                          |
| 39:45      | so we're gonna give you a really janky mobile interface           |
| 39:47      | that's missing 80% of the options that you need.                  |
| 39:51      | Because that's always good fun,                                   |
| 39:53      | though I did have one with something the other day,               |
| 39:55      | I was trying to cancel a subscription,                            |
| 39:56      | and I tried loading it in the browser on my Mac,                  |
| 39:59      | it didn't work, I tried the app on my iPhone,                     |
| 40:01      | it didn't work, and then I eventually realised,                   |
| 40:03      | I haven't tried the browser on my iPhone,                         |
| 40:05      | and the cancel button only appeared                               |
| 40:06      | in the browser on my iPhone, which was not fun,                   |
| 40:10      | but I reported it to them and reminded them                       |
| 40:12      | that they're not legally allowed to do that,                      |
| 40:14      | they have to have the cancel button show up everywhere.           |
| 40:17      | And I got an apologetic email on a voucher                        |
| 40:19      | for a service that I canceled back.                               |
| 40:21      | All right, there you go.                                          |
| 40:24      | Well, yeah, it's funny, because ICAP is the app,                  |
| 40:26      | it's not pretty, it's not user friendly,                          |
| 40:29      | but man, it can pretend to be anything on your iPad,              |
| 40:32      | and it's like you keep it for that reason.                        |
| 40:35      | Yep, exactly.                                                     |
| 40:36      | That's cool.                                                      |
| 40:38      | It does what you need when you need it.                           |
| 40:40      | So have you had success, Daniel, with this experimentation?       |
| 40:44      | So far, I haven't gotten too deep into it,                        |
| 40:45      | because I keep getting pulled off onto something else,            |
| 40:48      | but it got me far enough through,                                 |
| 40:50      | like in the years past, when I tried,                             |
| 40:52      | I'd run into something like I couldn't figure out                 |
| 40:54      | how to fake the stealth thing well enough,                        |
| 40:58      | or when you're first starting out scraping,                       |
| 41:00      | a lot of things will direct you to using static scraping,         |
| 41:03      | which means that it just loads the web page,                      |
| 41:06      | like there's a very popular Python library                        |
| 41:09      | called Beautiful Soup, which is great                             |
| 41:11      | for like taking apart the contents of a web page.                 |
| 41:15      | But it doesn't do anything to interact with the web page          |
| 41:19      | dynamically through its like JavaScript interfaces,               |
| 41:22      | and as anybody listening can probably imagine,                    |
| 41:25      | that's increasingly important for most websites.                  |
| 41:28      | So you can't just, like it used to be screen scraping meant,      |
| 41:31      | find the right URL, load it, and process the data.                |
| 41:35      | And in some cases, that still works,                              |
| 41:38      | and when it does, that can be a much faster, easier way           |
| 41:41      | to quote unquote scrape data,                                     |
| 41:44      | but a lot of the time now,                                        |
| 41:46      | you need to go through a little dance with the web page           |
| 41:48      | to make it think you're really a user browsing it.                |
| 41:52      | And so that's where this new stuff comes in.                      |
| 41:54      | Yes.                                                              |
| 41:55      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 41:56      | I have to say though, it is quite amazing                         |
| 41:57      | what apps are capable of doing.                                   |
| 42:00      | One that springs to mind is Transloader,                          |
| 42:03      | which is a great iOS and Mac OS application,                      |
| 42:06      | the idea being you send it a URL and say,                         |
| 42:08      | hey, go download this on my Mac,                                  |
| 42:09      | but not the Mac that I'm currently on that Mac over there,        |
| 42:12      | or this Mac and that Mac, or whatever it is,                      |
| 42:14      | and you can do it from your phone,                                |
| 42:15      | but you can pre authenticate yourself.                            |
| 42:17      | So it can keep your cookies and everything                        |
| 42:19      | so that it can then download stuff                                |
| 42:21      | using your authentication credentials,                            |
| 42:24      | which it wouldn't be able to do otherwise,                        |
| 42:26      | because it's just going to hit the URL,                           |
| 42:28      | and the URL is going to go, no, I don't know you,                 |
| 42:30      | but if you've pre logged in,                                      |
| 42:31      | then as long as the cookies don't expire,                         |
| 42:34      | I can remember that.                                              |
| 42:34      | And it's amazing how web scraping has snuck into our lives,       |
| 42:38      | even in ways that people aren't aware of.                         |
| 42:40      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 42:41      | I haven't seen this app,                                          |
| 42:42      | but I'm looking at the app store page right now,                  |
| 42:44      | and it looks like something I should check out,                   |
| 42:45      | because that's a great example.                                   |
| 42:48      | Like part of this whole puzzle                                    |
| 42:49      | is storing all your credentials and cookies and stuff.            |
| 42:52      | Yeah.                                                             |
| 42:53      | It sounds like this app has solved that aspect of the puzzle.     |
| 42:57      | Yes.                                                              |
| 42:58      | It's made by the creator of [[Yoink]],                                |
| 42:59      | and so he's got a couple of good apps,                            |
| 43:02      | including Backlook,                                               |
| 43:03      | which is a great app for developers.                              |

| 45:11      | So, Daniel, obviously you're having fun with, you know,           |
| 45:14      | some JavaScript there with Node and Puppeteer                     |
| 45:17      | and Headless Chrome and so on.                                    |
| 45:18      | But you also mentioned before JavaScript,                         |
| 45:21      | and obviously, you know, nowadays,                                |
| 45:24      | for starters, it's not the 1990s anymore,                         |
| 45:26      | it's the 2020s, and you've got an app called Fast Scripts.        |
| 45:31      | You know, what are you feeling about AppleScript at the moment?   |
| 45:34      | Is it going to be replaced by JavaScript                          |
| 45:36      | for automation on macOS,                                          |
| 45:39      | or is that as flaky as my personal experience tells me it is?     |
| 45:43      | And you know, where do you think this is going right now?         |
| 45:46      | Yeah, I mean, it's funny, if I dig into my archives,              |
| 45:49      | I have some old blog post probably from 10 plus years ago,        |
| 45:54      | strongly urging Apple to switch to JavaScript                     |
| 45:57      | for automation on the Mac.                                        |
| 45:59      | And it wasn't in the context, if I recall correctly,              |
| 46:01      | it wasn't in the context of like what they ended up doing,        |
| 46:04      | which is the JavaScript OSA interface                             |
| 46:07      | to basically the same infrastructure as AppleScript.              |
| 46:12      | I just thought I could see the writing on the wall                |
| 46:13      | at that time, like it was already,                                |
| 46:15      | Apple was already becoming like an industry leader                |
| 46:19      | in JavaScript by way of WebKit.                                   |
| 46:23      | And it just seemed like that was the place                        |
| 46:25      | they should focus their efforts.                                  |
| 46:28      | And they have really focused their efforts on JavaScript          |
| 46:31      | in the context of WebKit                                          |
| 46:34      | and not really anywhere else that I can think of.                 |
| 46:39      | And I mean, except, you know, so the thing is,                    |
| 46:42      | as it relates to AppleScript,                                     |
| 46:44      | in my opinion, the JavaScript OSA,                                |
| 46:47      | the JavaScript for automation as they call it,                    |
| 46:50      | it just shouldn't be there.                                       |
| 46:51      | Like it's just, I know some people use it                         |
| 46:53      | and apologies if you use it and like it more power to you,        |
| 46:56      | but it is not a game changer in any way.                          |
| 47:00      | And in my opinion, it ends up revealing more                      |
| 47:05      | like impedance mismatch between the language                      |
| 47:08      | and the AppleScript infrastructure.                               |
| 47:11      | And it's just, I find it really tedious to write myself.          |
| 47:15      | I wouldn't write a script in JavaScript for automation,           |
| 47:19      | but it's there.                                                   |
| 47:20      | And the state of things now as we, you know,                      |
| 47:25      | AppleScript is sort of, as most people know,                      |
| 47:28      | it's just not being invested in.                                  |
| 47:30      | And I don't think we can look forward to it                       |
| 47:32      | being invested in.                                                |
| 47:33      | Nonetheless, in the context of fast scripts,                      |
| 47:37      | it's, you know, I guess I should clarify,                         |
| 47:40      | fast scripts is not technically an AppleScript tool.              |
| 47:44      | It can run almost anything, almost any script on your Mac.        |
| 47:50      | However, it has certain sort of integrations                      |
| 47:53      | with the way it runs AppleScript                                  |
| 47:55      | that make it particularly nice for running AppleScript            |
| 48:00      | to many people.                                                   |
| 48:02      | So it's kind of simultaneously like a general purpose             |
| 48:04      | automation, you know, launcher tool                               |
| 48:07      | and a AppleScript power user tool.                                |
| 48:12      | You know this, I know,                                            |
| 48:13      | I'm explaining to folks who are listening.                        |
| 48:15      | And so I don't know,                                              |
| 48:18      | I don't know where AppleScript is going,                          |
| 48:20      | but I guess where I was getting at is,                            |
| 48:22      | whatever the case may be, as things stand now,                    |
| 48:26      | AppleScript is still the best thing going                         |
| 48:28      | for automating many things on your Mac.                           |
| 48:31      | And so that's my incentive is personal selfishness                |
| 48:35      | to want the best possible AppleScript running app                 |
| 48:41      | I can make for myself.                                            |
| 48:43      | And then it turns out a bunch of other people in the world        |
| 48:46      | who are still steeped in AppleScript                              |
| 48:49      | really like using fast scripts.                                   |
| 48:52      | Yes.                                                              |
| 48:53      | Yeah, I didn't realise actually until,                            |
| 48:54      | I think it was just the last week                                 |
| 48:55      | that I can use it to run other scripts.                           |
| 48:57      | Like it never occurred to me that I could do that.                |
| 49:00      | And so now I've got a bunch of fast scripts                       |
| 49:03      | that I'd written to do various things that work.                  |
| 49:05      | They're just all sitting in my menu bar on my work machine.       |
| 49:07      | It's like, oh, great, thanks.                                     |
| 49:09      | It never occurred to me,                                          |
| 49:10      | like literally never occurred to me until                         |
| 49:11      | about last week when I was poking around,                         |
| 49:13      | go, I wonder if I can write an AppleScript                        |
| 49:15      | to run the bash code.                                             |
| 49:15      | And it's like, wait a minute,                                     |
| 49:17      | hang on a second, I'm over complicating things here.              |
| 49:20      | But yeah, it is amazing to me in particular,                      |
| 49:23      | how powerful AppleScript is in terms of everything else.          |
| 49:29      | And I think you're right,                                         |
| 49:30      | because JavaScript expects you to be working with objects         |
| 49:34      | and has JavaScript object notation, JSON, and so on.              |
| 49:38      | So a lot of people think of it and use it like that.              |
| 49:40      | And as a web developer, I very definitely do.                     |
| 49:42      | And it is a mismatch.                                             |
| 49:44      | When you're working with something                                |
| 49:47      | that's from the operating system,                                 |
| 49:50      | it isn't just an object in the sense that you might think of it.  |
| 49:54      | And so manipulating it the same way                               |
| 49:56      | that you would do elsewhere is not impossible.                    |
| 50:01      | It's just awkward in some ways.                                   |
| 50:05      | And I find that actually having the right language,               |
| 50:08      | like it's the right tool for the right job, right?                |
| 50:11      | Just because you can use a hammer to drive in a screw             |
| 50:13      | doesn't mean that it's a good answer.                             |
| 50:15      | And it's one of those things where it flows better                |
| 50:19      | with AppleScript.                                                 |
| 50:19      | And oddly enough, I've read a lot of JavaScript day to day,       |
| 50:24      | but if you write the same script in AppleScript                   |
| 50:28      | and in JavaScript object notation, JavaScript for automation,     |
| 50:32      | you'll often find the AppleScript ones faster.                    |
| 50:35      | Sometimes by a very significant amount,                           |
| 50:37      | which is just very weird and entertaining.                        |
| 50:40      | And also sometimes the AppleScript one works                      |
| 50:42      | and the JavaScript one doesn't.                                   |
| 50:44      | And my conclusion is it's not hooked up                           |
| 50:46      | to the same Apple events quite perfectly.                         |
| 50:50      | And so something just misses somewhere.                           |
| 50:53      | So I tend to fall back to AppleScript                             |
| 50:55      | rather than reaching for JavaScript there.                        |
| 50:57      | Well, one possible explanation for that                           |
| 50:59      | is the neglect that AppleScript has had.                          |
| 51:04      | Think about it, it was inventid and implemented                   |
| 51:08      | to run on 1990s Macs.                                             |
| 51:11      | So it's optimised for parsing all of the language,                |
| 51:16      | running all the commands to be fast on a 1990s Mac.               |
| 51:20      | And you know how it is now, you run some old 1990s software       |
| 51:24      | on a current Mac, it's gonna blaze.                               |
| 51:26      | And whereas with the JavaScript for automation stuff,             |
| 51:29      | they have to load in the whole infrastructure                     |
| 51:32      | of JavaScript engine that can power the web.                      |
| 51:36      | And so I don't know, that's kind of an interesting example        |
| 51:39      | where it's like, well, it's missing a lot of stuff,               |
| 51:41      | but what it has, it can do sometimes quite quickly.               |
| 51:44      | Well, I mean, I think also with AppleScript,                      |
| 51:47      | there was a honeymoon period where there were a group             |
| 51:49      | of extremely smart people at Apple working actively               |
| 51:54      | on making AppleScript really awesome.                             |
| 51:57      | And while Apple kind of the bloom fell off the rose for Apple,    |
| 52:00      | that work was done.                                               |
| 52:02      | I'm not sure there was ever a honeymoon period                    |
| 52:04      | for implementation of JavaScript on the Mac.                      |
| 52:07      | No, no, no, it's, you're absolutely right.                        |
| 52:09      | And it feels, that's why it just feels so tacked on               |
| 52:13      | to me that I think it would be better                             |
| 52:15      | if it wasn't there in many respects.                              |
| 52:18      | Yeah, yeah, that is something that can often be said              |
| 52:21      | about many solutions, you know, you see a company is done.        |
| 52:25      | Oh yeah, so like you wanna be able to download                    |
| 52:27      | all the data, great.                                              |
| 52:29      | So we're gonna give you a 3000 megabyte zip file.                 |
| 52:32      | And we've given you every single piece of information             |
| 52:35      | that we've got about you, rendered as a PNG.                      |
| 52:39      | It's very high resolution, but it's all rendered as a PNG.        |
| 52:41      | It's like, great, thanks, you know, technically compliant,        |
| 52:44      | but not actually being useful.                                    |
| 52:45      | You may as well have not bothered.                                |
| 52:47      | And unfortunately, sometimes JavaScript for automation            |
| 52:52      | can feel like that.                                               |
| 52:54      | I do think that we've lost the thread a little bit.               |
| 52:57      | Yes.                                                              |
| 52:58      | So you've made this app Fast Scripts,                             |
| 52:59      | and there are other ways to launch [[AppleScript]]s on your Mac,     |
| 53:02      | but tell us, why does Fast Scripts exist?                         |
| 53:06      | Well, Fast Scripts goes back to a time                            |
| 53:09      | before there were many other ways to run scripts                  |
| 53:13      | for one thing.                                                    |
| 53:14      | When I wrote it, it was around the turn of the century.           |
| 53:18      | So it's been a while.                                             |
| 53:21      | And I wrote it actually early in the Mac OS 10 days               |
| 53:25      | as I was missing the functionality from an OS 9,                  |
| 53:30      | an earlier app called, I think it was called,                     |
| 53:34      | OS A menu.                                                        |
| 53:36      | And it was basically started as a perfect copy of that,           |
| 53:41      | just like the idea would be,                                      |
| 53:42      | there would be an icon in the menu bar.                           |
| 53:44      | It would list your scripts,                                       |
| 53:45      | and you would select them and run them.                           |
| 53:48      | And the motivation was,                                           |
| 53:50      | and the reason it's called Fast Scripts,                          |
| 53:52      | is because at that time,                                          |
| 53:54      | Apple and scripting automation people in general                  |
| 53:57      | were all focused on like long workflows.                          |
| 54:01      | Like the main use case for scripts                                |
| 54:03      | was to write something that you could point at your pile          |
| 54:07      | of like a hundred photos and,                                     |
| 54:09      | you know, a thousand pages of manuscript                          |
| 54:11      | and have it like typeset it or something.                         |
| 54:14      | And it would take an hour or two,                                 |
| 54:15      | and it would be done, it would be great, it would be automated.   |
| 54:18      | But those types of tasks were all oriented around                 |
| 54:21      | like opening a script in [[Script Editor]]                            |
| 54:23      | and manually invoking it with a mouse or something.               |
| 54:27      | And my idea at the time,                                          |
| 54:29      | and the very first version of Fast Scripts                        |
| 54:31      | didn't support keyboard shortcuts or anything.                    |
| 54:34      | It was just the icon in the menu bar,                             |
| 54:36      | but the idea was to be able to run scripts                        |
| 54:40      | that it wouldn't be worth opening up [[Script Editor]],               |
| 54:44      | opening the script,                                               |
| 54:45      | and clicking the play button on the [[Script Editor]].                |
| 54:49      | So, you know, examples are things like,                           |
| 54:52      | I have scripts that run,                                          |
| 54:54      | I run in Safari to go to all like the favourite URLs               |
| 54:58      | I like to go to.                                                  |
| 54:59      | I would never open up [[Script Editor]]                               |
| 55:01      | to go put like a Open New York Times news,                        |
| 55:06      | you know, script and run it.                                      |
| 55:09      | So, the idea was fast,                                            |
| 55:11      | I wanted the scripts to be both fast in their availability        |
| 55:16      | and fast in their execution.                                      |
| 55:18      | So, the very first, and that was the other thing,                 |
| 55:20      | is with [[AppleScript]], with the [[Script Editor]] at that time,        |
| 55:25      | every time you ran a script,                                      |
| 55:27      | I think it would load the whole script into memory                |
| 55:29      | and then run it.                                                  |
| 55:30      | And so, there was always a little lag.                            |
| 55:32      | And so, the first version of Fast Scripts                         |
| 55:34      | traded the cost of memory for speed                               |
| 55:41      | by loading every script into memory ahead of time.                |
| 55:44      | And so, it would all be there ready to run                        |
| 55:46      | so that when you invoked the script, it would be instant.         |
| 55:49      | And that was unheard of at the time.                              |
| 55:52      | So, it was kind of scratching my own itch,                        |
| 55:54      | but then slowly, but surely people were like,                     |
| 55:56      | wow, there's a type of script                                     |
| 55:58      | that I can't really run meaningfully                              |
| 56:01      | in any other context but this.                                    |
| 56:03      | So, anyway, over time,                                            |
| 56:06      | the sort of primary value of the app has changed                  |
| 56:09      | and it's been interesting for me because,                         |
| 56:12      | for instance, in the most recent version,                         |
| 56:15      | Fast Scripts 3, which was just released a few months ago,         |
| 56:20      | it, I think it's a few months ago,                                |
| 56:24      | I'm sort of spacey as everybody else is                           |
| 56:26      | in pandemic thinking.                                             |
| 56:30      | One of the things I had to do was abandon                         |
| 56:32      | my like Fast Scripts 1.0 idea                                     |
| 56:35      | that scripts should be loaded into memory.                        |
| 56:39      | And it turned out it didn't matter                                |
| 56:41      | because computers are fast now.                                   |
| 56:44      | Not only, in Fast Scripts 3,                                      |
| 56:46      | not only are scripts not pre-loaded into memory,                  |
| 56:49      | Fast Scripts 3 also adds all these new efficiencies               |
| 56:53      | around being able to run multiple scripts at the same time.       |
| 56:57      | And that involves this whole system of me                         |
| 57:02      | spawning a separate application process                           |
| 57:04      | for every script that you run.                                    |
| 57:06      | And that sounds really complicated                                |
| 57:08      | and inefficient but it's super efficient                          |
| 57:10      | and it's super fast and it's great                                |
| 57:12      | because it defies every implementation detail                     |
| 57:15      | of the first version of Fast Scripts,                             |
| 57:18      | but it still fulfills all of the user expectations.               |
| 57:22      | Yes, yeah, that is one of the things                              |
| 57:25      | where I was just thinking like, pooh, yeah,                       |
| 57:27      | like I think my Mac Studio that's sitting here,                   |
| 57:29      | like I didn't even go all out on the spec,                        |
| 57:31      | I'm pretty certain it can run                                     |
| 57:33      | the vast majority of [[AppleScript]]s insanely quickly,              |
| 57:36      | which is a great thing.                                           |
| 57:38      | Speaking of updates that you've done recently,                    |
| 57:40      | one of the ones that I loved,                                     |
| 57:42      | and of course this went everywhere around                         |
| 57:45      | the nerd circle and the internet,                                 |
| 57:47      | I know John Gruber posted about it,                               |
| 57:49      | I'm pretty certain Dr. Drang posted about this,                   |
| 57:51      | you've streamlined regular expressions in [[AppleScript]].           |
| 57:55      | Guilty.                                                           |
| 57:57      | Yeah, that's the nerdiest thing I've done                         |
| 58:00      | for the scripting community in a long time.                       |
| 58:03      | It's funny because I had all these priorities                     |
| 58:06      | on my list of things to do for Fast Scripts                       |
| 58:08      | that were things like, I just mentioned things like,              |
| 58:11      | running multiple scripts at a time                                |
| 58:13      | and spawning out to different processes,                          |
| 58:16      | supporting progress feedback through the standard                 |
| 58:19      | progress mechanism, these things I got into Fast Scripts 3        |
| 58:23      | and then I was like, breathe a sigh of relief                     |
| 58:26      | because now all the stuff that's been nagging at me               |
| 58:30      | that I wanted to do for 10 years or so,                           |
| 58:33      | I got done in Fast Scripts 3.                                     |
| 58:35      | And now I can just focus on things                                |
| 58:37      | that I think are sort of,                                         |
| 58:39      | it's kind of like I built the house                               |
| 58:40      | and now I can put up the nice curtains,                           |
| 58:42      | it's like, okay, the house is waterproof,                         |
| 58:46      | all of the doors and latches work, now let's make this place      |
| 58:50      | feel nice and the regular expression support                      |
| 58:52      | is kind of the first and I hope a long line                       |
| 58:56      | of scripting affordances for the app.                             |
| 59:00      | So for anybody out there who uses [[AppleScript]],                   |
| 59:03      | the idea is basically Fast Scripts is a launcher tool             |
| 59:06      | but it also supports its own scripting commands                   |
| 59:09      | that you can easily use and access                                |
| 59:12      | even if you're not running the script from Fast Scripts,          |
| 59:15      | but it kind of includes its own scripting additions               |
| 59:18      | and this regular expression thing that Rose is alluding to        |
| 59:22      | is basically a way to process text in your [[AppleScript]]s          |
| 59:29      | without the usual mechanism                                       |
| 59:32      | for using regular expressions was to dispatch out                 |
| 59:35      | to a shell script or to use a third party script library          |
| 59:39      | or to automate with [[BBEdit]] or something like that.               |
| 59:43      | Yes, so what you can do now is inside your [[AppleScript]]           |
| 59:47      | wherever you are, where you need to split some text up,           |
| 59:49      | you can just continue where you are                               |
| 59:50      | and say, tell Application Fast Scripts,                           |
| 59:52      | do whatever the magic is that you need to do                      |
| 59:55      | and then tell and then you're back in the regular script          |
| 59:58      | and you've just had a very quick conversation                     |
| 01:00:01   | with Fast Scripts and it's done some magic.                       |
| 01:00:04   | Yeah, used it a couple of times, I love it.                       |
| 01:00:06   | That's great, I'm glad to hear it                                 |
| 01:00:08   | and I want to emphasise for anybody listening                     |
| 01:00:11   | that that is a completely free feature of the app                 |
| 01:00:14   | and one of the things I want to do with Fast Scripts              |
| 01:00:17   | and I've wanted to do since the beginning                         |
| 01:00:19   | is to have it be as a baseline product,                           |
| 01:00:23   | a better way, basically a better version                          |
| 01:00:25   | of Apple's script menu, but that also does something,             |
| 01:00:29   | does that job better and then also offers extra things            |
| 01:00:33   | for free and then premium features                                |
| 01:00:36   | that you get paying a little bit more.                            |
| 01:00:38   | So that I encourage people, if they're interested in that,        |
| 01:00:42   | just consider downloading and using Fast Scripts for free,        |
| 01:00:46   | don't even worry about whether you might want                     |
| 01:00:48   | to pay for it someday, because yeah,                              |
| 01:00:50   | part of that for me is I hope someday you do pay for it,          |
| 01:00:53   | but in the meantime, I just have empathy for scripters            |
| 01:00:56   | and I would like everybody out there                              |
| 01:00:58   | who can see the value in a streamlined script menu                |
| 01:01:03   | to use it and enjoy it.                                           |
| 01:01:05   | Yes, yes, and it is really great                                  |
| 01:01:08   | that you're one of the many people making tools                   |
| 01:01:11   | that make the scripting solutions                                 |
| 01:01:14   | and the automation solutions                                      |
| 01:01:15   | that we already use even better.                                  |
| 01:01:16   | And it's lovely to see Fast Scripts doing this                    |
| 01:01:20   | from both sides, both the executing                               |
| 01:01:23   | as well as the being involved inside of the execution.            |
| 01:01:29   | So you get all of the advantages, which is even better.           |
| 01:01:32   | Yeah, and I'll just mention one other thing                       |
| 01:01:34   | about the whole philosophy of Fast Scripts                        |
| 01:01:36   | is basically since the beginning,                                 |
| 01:01:38   | whenever I noticed something annoying                             |
| 01:01:40   | about the process of running a script,                            |
| 01:01:42   | I think, how can I make that better?                              |
| 01:01:44   | And so there's little things Fast Scripts does                    |
| 01:01:47   | that you might not notice unless it wasn't doing them.            |
| 01:01:50   | And it includes things like there's a priority                    |
| 01:01:54   | in Fast Scripts that if your script brings up                     |
| 01:01:56   | like a prompt or a panel, then that takes attention               |
| 01:02:02   | away from the app you were in.                                    |
| 01:02:04   | Now, I'm pretty sure it's still the case                          |
| 01:02:07   | that in every other way of running,                               |
| 01:02:09   | or at least most other ways of running scripts,                   |
| 01:02:12   | that after you're done dismissing the panel,                      |
| 01:02:14   | now you're suddenly like in some kind of weird limbo              |
| 01:02:17   | where you're not really focused on the old app anymore.           |
| 01:02:21   | And that's one example of many things                             |
| 01:02:23   | where I try to make the process of running the script nicer.      |
| 01:02:26   | And so we'll actually remember what app you were in               |
| 01:02:29   | and put you back into it after you're done.                       |
| 01:02:31   | And that's what I was gonna ask really,                           |
| 01:02:32   | because I feel like although Fast Scripts started out             |
| 01:02:36   | to run a publishing workflow in the 90s,                          |
| 01:02:40   | it really has evolved a lot.                                      |
| 01:02:42   | And like you keep finding all of these rough edges                |
| 01:02:45   | around automation on the Mac,                                     |
| 01:02:47   | and then Fast Scripts comes in with a solution,                   |
| 01:02:49   | whether it be a regular expression tool                           |
| 01:02:52   | or just a way to get your scripts running faster.                 |
| 01:02:55   | And then to me, it's not the menu bar, man.                       |
| 01:02:58   | It's the keyboard shortcuts.                                      |
| 01:02:59   | I love that so much, you know?                                    |
| 01:03:00   | Yeah, I mean, that's funny too,                                   |
| 01:03:02   | because that's like, Rose was saying earlier,                     |
| 01:03:05   | like she hadn't noticed that you can run non-[[AppleScript]]s.       |
| 01:03:07   | And I was thinking to myself, you know,                           |
| 01:03:09   | it's all on me, but the main thing I've done wrong                |
| 01:03:13   | with Fast Scripts over all these years,                           |
| 01:03:15   | from the beginning, I made it for people                          |
| 01:03:17   | who basically I knew already knew what they wanted.               |
| 01:03:21   | And it was, you know, and so I never had to,                      |
| 01:03:24   | I never felt like I had to explain what Fast Scripts can do.      |
| 01:03:28   | And the negative of that is that I've been catching up            |
| 01:03:31   | ever since, and there's all these things in it                    |
| 01:03:34   | where I've added things over the years to accommodate             |
| 01:03:37   | something that like most people at the time                       |
| 01:03:39   | just sort of expected it would do.                                |
| 01:03:42   | And then as time goes on, it's just this accumulating mass        |
| 01:03:45   | of features and functionality that aren't all                     |
| 01:03:48   | totally well documented and, you know,                            |
| 01:03:51   | not promoted or marketed.                                         |
| 01:03:53   | So that's something I'll work on,                                 |
| 01:03:55   | but it is kind of like one of these things                        |
| 01:03:57   | kind of like one of these apps that is what I'm,                  |
| 01:04:00   | one thing I'm proud of it for is it can be                        |
| 01:04:04   | exceedingly simple on the surface while having depth              |
| 01:04:08   | if you dig into it and look for it.                               |
| 01:04:11   | I would like to just make a note in your defense.                 |
| 01:04:13   | I've been using it to run Python scripts,                         |
| 01:04:15   | so I'm not quite sure why it didn't occur to me                   |
| 01:04:17   | that I could run a Bash script.                                   |
| 01:04:18   | I think it's just one of those things where my brain was like,    |
| 01:04:22   | well, obviously this is completely different                      |
| 01:04:24   | and therefore that's not going to work.                           |
| 01:04:25   | So I'm not even going to try.                                     |
| 01:04:28   | And then I was looking at it the other day and was like,          |
| 01:04:30   | I bet this is going to work.                                      |
| 01:04:31   | And I popped it in there.                                         |
| 01:04:33   | Well, it works, surprise.                                         |
| 01:04:36   | So yeah, it's just one of those things where it's just like,      |
| 01:04:39   | oh yeah, I missed trying the obvious.                             |
| 01:04:41   | And I think this is something where as well,                      |
| 01:04:43   | some people who don't know what they were like,                   |
| 01:04:45   | who don't necessarily know that that's the thing                  |
| 01:04:47   | would just try putting all the scripts in there                   |
| 01:04:49   | and seeing what happens.                                          |
| 01:04:52   | And, you know, and so they would just have solved                 |
| 01:04:54   | that problem by not even thinking about it.                       |
| 01:04:57   | And instead I overthought it which complicated things             |
| 01:04:59   | because that's me and I'm special.                                |
| 01:05:00   | Yeah, try throwing random things in there                         |
| 01:05:03   | because probably the least expected quote unquote script          |
| 01:05:06   | you can throw in there is any document.                           |
| 01:05:10   | If you just throw like a file in there,                           |
| 01:05:12   | you can throw like a pages document in there                      |
| 01:05:14   | and you could assign it to a keyboard shortcut if you want to.    |
| 01:05:17   | And it'll open it.                                                |
| 01:05:20   | So, you know, it kind of tries to deal with everything            |
| 01:05:23   | as a script first and then if it can't,                           |
| 01:05:25   | it deals with it as an app or as a document.                      |
| 01:05:28   | So it just opens things in that sense.                            |
| 01:05:31   | It's like so many other launchers in that way.                    |
| 01:05:34   | But it's unlike something like [[LaunchBar]],                         |
| 01:05:36   | it's not really oriented around general purpose launching.        |
| 01:05:40   | It's oriented around launching things                             |
| 01:05:42   | that you organise to be in the scripts folder.                    |
| 01:05:46   | While I'm thinking about it,                                      |
| 01:05:48   | do you discourage people from using sim links                     |
| 01:05:51   | to put scripts in there?                                          |
| 01:05:53   | Because I've got scripts that are stored                          |
| 01:05:55   | for various reasons inside of this [[Git]] repo                       |
| 01:05:58   | or that [[Git]] repo.                                                 |
| 01:05:59   | And I don't necessarily want to put them all                      |
| 01:06:02   | in the library scripts folder.                                    |
| 01:06:04   | Is that something you recommend or discourage                     |
| 01:06:06   | or is it just fine?                                               |
| 01:06:08   | It should be just fine.                                           |
| 01:06:10   | It's funny, in particular,                                        |
| 01:06:12   | sim links were a tricky challenge for me                          |
| 01:06:14   | that I don't think I quite got right until Fast Scripts 3.        |
| 01:06:19   | And I hope it's right now                                         |
| 01:06:20   | and let me know if you run into problems.                         |
| 01:06:22   | But I did for many, many, many years                              |
| 01:06:25   | support aliases without supporting sim links.                     |
| 01:06:29   | So distinction there that an alias is a file                      |
| 01:06:33   | that can be resolved to a target                                  |
| 01:06:36   | whereas a sim link is at the file system level.                   |
| 01:06:39   | But yeah, it should work.                                         |
| 01:06:40   | And I encourage that.                                             |
| 01:06:41   | And it's sort of all part of a shortcoming of Fast Scripts        |
| 01:06:45   | that it's not easier to configure it                              |
| 01:06:47   | to run things outside of the scripts folder.                      |
| 01:06:49   | But that's probably something on the list for the future.         |
| 01:06:53   | But yeah, in the meantime,                                        |
| 01:06:55   | that is actually a really great way                               |
| 01:06:57   | is just to either drag aliases in                                 |
| 01:07:01   | or to make sim links to folders                                   |
| 01:07:04   | or to specific scripts that are outside the.                      |
| 01:07:07   | And that can be really useful in terms of the,                    |
| 01:07:11   | this is kind of getting into deep Fast Scripts feature territory. |
| 01:07:15   | But one of the great things about Fast Scripts                    |
| 01:07:16   | is you can have app-specific scripts                              |
| 01:07:18   | that are determined just by where they are                        |
| 01:07:21   | in your scripts hierarchy.                                        |
| 01:07:22   | In the application subfolder of your scripts hierarchy,           |
| 01:07:27   | you can put app-specific scripts.                                 |
| 01:07:28   | And sometimes you wanna have the same script                      |
| 01:07:30   | in multiple apps.                                                 |
| 01:07:31   | And so using the sim links or aliases                             |
| 01:07:34   | is another good trick there.                                      |
| 01:07:35   | Yes, for some reason,                                             |
| 01:07:37   | I don't think I ever looked at the documentation                  |
| 01:07:39   | to see that aliases were supported.                               |
| 01:07:40   | And that's a lot easier                                           |
| 01:07:41   | because you just right click and find her                         |
| 01:07:43   | and make aliases right there.                                     |
| 01:07:44   | I years ago installed some utilities                              |
| 01:07:48   | from JuneCloud, the makers of delivery.                           |
| 01:07:50   | And they have a service for making sim links to things,           |
| 01:07:55   | which I've used a lot over the years.                             |
| 01:07:57   | Obviously, you can do it in a number of ways.                     |
| 01:08:00   | But of course, an alias is really easy.                           |
| 01:08:02   | So that's perfect.                                                |
| 01:08:04   | That may even be better in some ways for what I'm doing.          |
| 01:08:08   | Hopefully whatever you try works.                                 |
| 01:08:09   | So I'm glad that I now support both of them.                      |
| 01:08:11   | I mean, I've yet to run into problems outside of my brain.        |
| 01:08:14   | All the problems I've run into so far                             |
| 01:08:15   | have basically been my brain going,                               |
| 01:08:16   | I don't know what to do here.                                     |
| 01:08:18   | I'm just gonna not do it                                          |
| 01:08:20   | because I don't think that's gonna work.                          |
| 01:08:21   | And it turns out when I actually get around to trying it,         |
| 01:08:24   | it does work.                                                     |
| 01:08:25   | So it's quite impressive, I have to say.                          |
| 01:08:28   | Daniel, I wanted to ask you,                                      |
| 01:08:29   | because you've got another app                                    |
| 01:08:31   | that's not an automation focused app,                             |
| 01:08:33   | but an app that benefits from automation integration.             |
| 01:08:36   | And that's MarsEdit.                                              |
| 01:08:37   | MarsEdit is an excellent blogging tool.                           |
| 01:08:40   | In fact, I recently switched to WordPress                         |
| 01:08:43   | and hooray, I'm able to use MarsEdit again.                       |
| 01:08:46   | And it's so nice having like a native app on my Mac.              |
| 01:08:48   | I can write on and not worry about, you know,                     |
| 01:08:51   | the web screwing me over.                                         |
| 01:08:55   | So, but you have like,                                            |
| 01:08:57   | because you come to this with a kind of an automator's mindset,   |
| 01:09:01   | you have brought automation to MarsEdit.                          |
| 01:09:03   | Can you kind of share for the audience                            |
| 01:09:04   | some of the stuff you're doing in MarsEdit?                       |
| 01:09:07   | Yeah, well, so MarsEdit automation                                |
| 01:09:11   | is largely oriented around,                                       |
| 01:09:13   | you know, editing the contents of a particular post               |
| 01:09:18   | or putting together a post.                                       |
| 01:09:20   | So the ways I use it personally is like speaking of podcasts,     |
| 01:09:26   | I have like a script that puts together                           |
| 01:09:29   | a new episode post for my podcast.                                |
| 01:09:33   | And it's, you know, just sort of like prompts me                  |
| 01:09:37   | for the title and the excerpt                                     |
| 01:09:40   | and the list of links and all that.                               |
| 01:09:42   | And then it puts it together and it's just a way of,              |
| 01:09:45   | it's kind of like, it's actually like kind of filling             |
| 01:09:47   | the shortcoming of there being like a stationary tool             |
| 01:09:50   | for particular post formats.                                      |
| 01:09:54   | But that's one example of something I use it for.                 |
| 01:09:58   | I also use it for automating, creating new blog posts             |
| 01:10:02   | for all of my products themselves, the apps.                      |
| 01:10:05   | Like when I have a new version of Fast Scripts or MarsEdit,       |
| 01:10:08   | I have a script for each of those                                 |
| 01:10:10   | that asks me what version it is                                   |
| 01:10:13   | and what the release notes are.                                   |
| 01:10:15   | And that just automatically generates a new blog post             |
| 01:10:19   | document that I can then send to the blog.                        |
| 01:10:23   | That's one thing, you know, some people, I will say,              |
| 01:10:26   | some people look at MarsEdit and they think,                      |
| 01:10:28   | great, this thing's automatable.                                  |
| 01:10:30   | I'm gonna use it to migrate my whole blog                         |
| 01:10:33   | from like, let's say blogger to WordPress.                        |
| 01:10:35   | And I usually discourage that.                                    |
| 01:10:38   | And in fact, I don't have great support for that,                 |
| 01:10:42   | in part because MarsEdit is limited                               |
| 01:10:46   | in the access it has to most blogging systems,                    |
| 01:10:51   | you know, not in ways that prevent you                            |
| 01:10:53   | from doing a great job writing and publishing posts,              |
| 01:10:56   | but in ways that, you know, do limit how well                     |
| 01:11:00   | you can perfectly clone an existing blog.                         |
| 01:11:04   | So I usually encourage people to use other techniques             |
| 01:11:06   | like most blog systems have an export feature,                    |
| 01:11:09   | you know, data export, but, you know,                             |
| 01:11:13   | all kinds of things like that, little nice things                 |
| 01:11:17   | like I have little scripts to put in links                        |
| 01:11:25   | to things that like, with a referral code in them,                |
| 01:11:29   | like, you know, paste a link into this blog post                  |
| 01:11:32   | with a referral code from Amazon or whatever.                     |
| 01:11:36   | And those are the kinds of things that, again,                    |
| 01:11:38   | it's easy for me to add as I use the app                          |
| 01:11:42   | and just get annoyed by things.                                   |
| 01:11:43   | So I have a long list of things I'd like to add still             |
| 01:11:46   | to MarsEdit automation-wise, but that's that kind of stuff.       |
| 01:11:51   | And for example, I recently added support                         |
| 01:11:54   | for setting the contents of, one of the things                    |
| 01:11:57   | you can do in MarsEdit is you can configure                       |
| 01:11:59   | your custom fields if you have those in WordPress.                |
| 01:12:02   | And so one expansion to the automation I recently added           |
| 01:12:06   | lets you set the values of the custom fields,                     |
| 01:12:08   | which was great because I do all my sponsorships                  |
| 01:12:12   | on my blog posts for my podcast using custom fields,              |
| 01:12:18   | and I used to have to do all that manually.                       |
| 01:12:19   | And now I can just run a script that says like,                   |
| 01:12:22   | okay, put the, you know, so happens, text expand                  |
| 01:12:26   | or sometimes sponsors my podcast.                                 |
| 01:12:28   | So coincidence there, but, you know,                              |
| 01:12:30   | I can run a script that says put the TextExpander details        |
| 01:12:34   | into this blog post.                                              |
| 01:12:36   | Yeah.                                                             |
| 01:12:37   | Things like that are great.                                       |
| 01:12:38   | Have you explored shortcuts with it?                              |
| 01:12:41   | I mean, is that something you're interested in?                   |
| 01:12:43   | With MarsEdit, yeah, it's on my list.                             |
| 01:12:46   | It's actually on my list with fast scripts too.                   |
| 01:12:48   | I really think, you know,                                         |
| 01:12:50   | kind of getting back to fast scripts                              |
| 01:12:52   | and like what's up with AppleScript and shortcuts.               |
| 01:12:55   | I think as time goes forward, I'm going to be thinking            |
| 01:12:59   | increasingly like not what can I do for AppleScript authors,     |
| 01:13:04   | but what can I do for anybody                                     |
| 01:13:05   | who's automating something on the Mac, you know?                  |
| 01:13:08   | So I have ideas along those lines.                                |
| 01:13:11   | The Apple's infrastructure so far                                 |
| 01:13:14   | doesn't let you do a ton as far as running shortcuts goes.        |
| 01:13:17   | You're pretty much limited to just like                           |
| 01:13:20   | ask the shortcut system to run a shortcut by name.                |
| 01:13:23   | So it's kind of like automating the equivalent of saying          |
| 01:13:25   | like, hey, dingus, run this.                                      |
| 01:13:29   | But I think there's a lot of things I can do                      |
| 01:13:32   | to expose the similar, you know,                                  |
| 01:13:35   | the kinds of things I mentioned, scriptable things.               |
| 01:13:39   | Like another thing fast scripts has built in                      |
| 01:13:41   | is this kind of heads up display message display                  |
| 01:13:45   | scripting command that lets you kind of do                        |
| 01:13:47   | a lighter weight feedback like display a message                  |
| 01:13:51   | in the corner with self-dismissing.                               |
| 01:13:54   | If you want like streamlined messages                             |
| 01:13:57   | supposed to like an alert you have to dismiss or whatever.        |
| 01:14:00   | And that's something I plan to expose                             |
| 01:14:02   | via shortcuts to anybody                                          |
| 01:14:05   | so that you don't have to write a script necessarily              |
| 01:14:08   | to be able to take advantage of that.                             |
| 01:14:10   | And Mars Edit of course is perfect for,                           |
| 01:14:13   | it should be exposed to the shortcut system                       |
| 01:14:16   | for like so many other shortcuts                                  |
| 01:14:19   | that just work with text and images.                              |
| 01:14:21   | If you could use it as part of the workflow                       |
| 01:14:24   | that gets you to the point of a blog post                         |
| 01:14:26   | that's ready to publish,                                          |
| 01:14:27   | I think that would be really useful.                              |
| 01:14:29   | Yes, I can imagine that would be really useful.                   |
| 01:14:33   | I look forward to potentially a future                            |
| 01:14:35   | where you're crazy enough to start supporting                     |
| 01:14:38   | text-based CMS, I use Jackal.                                     |
| 01:14:42   | The number of custom fields possible with that is just,           |
| 01:14:45   | well, I mean, it's literally limitless                            |
| 01:14:47   | because it's a text file, you can put anything in there.          |
| 01:14:51   | So maybe that won't be on the back page for a while.              |
| 01:14:54   | I don't think you need to,                                        |
| 01:14:56   | I don't think you should be excited                               |
| 01:14:58   | about that being a forthcoming feature,                           |
| 01:15:00   | but I also don't think you need to feel hopeless about it.        |
| 01:15:03   | It's definitely on my list.                                       |
| 01:15:05   | It's funny because years and years and years ago,                 |
| 01:15:08   | Mars Edit did support a text-based system called Blossom.         |
| 01:15:12   | You might remember that.                                          |
| 01:15:14   | But it basically ran up against,                                  |
| 01:15:18   | I had other priorities,                                           |
| 01:15:19   | I needed to support things for Blogger and WordPress              |
| 01:15:22   | and Tumblr and all these other services.                          |
| 01:15:24   | And I fell by the wayside.                                        |
| 01:15:26   | And it's been on my mind,                                         |
| 01:15:28   | I wanna get back to it at some point                              |
| 01:15:29   | and you will be on my beta list when that happens.                |
| 01:15:34   | Oh, absolutely, sign me up.                                       |
| 01:15:35   | I'm willing to break anything.                                    |
| 01:15:37   | I hopefully just provide actually useful bug reports.             |
| 01:15:41   | But it is amazing how the right tool                              |
| 01:15:43   | can really make things a lot easier.                              |
| 01:15:46   | And also just adding even more automation support                 |
| 01:15:49   | can be really good.                                               |
| 01:15:50   | One of the things that springs to mind, of course,                |
| 01:15:52   | is Rogue Amoeba recently added shortcut support                   |
| 01:15:55   | and a new scripting support with custom JavaScript,               |
| 01:15:59   | I believe it was for audio hijack.                                |
| 01:16:02   | Obviously, Omni Group have got custom JavaScript,                 |
| 01:16:05   | [[Drafts]] has got custom JavaScript.                                 |
| 01:16:07   | If you get nerdy, you can write Obsidian plugins.                 |
| 01:16:09   | Do you think maybe there's a future                               |
| 01:16:11   | of a custom JavaScript automation inside of Mars Edit             |
| 01:16:14   | or are you just gonna stick with                                  |
| 01:16:16   | a AppleScript and shortcuts for now                              |
| 01:16:18   | as you've already got a pretty long to-do list?                   |
| 01:16:20   | Yeah, well, again, it's probably not imminent or anything,        |
| 01:16:23   | but one of the reasons, I think for example,                      |
| 01:16:26   | in the Omni case, they were strongly motivated to do that         |
| 01:16:29   | in part because Apple didn't have                                 |
| 01:16:32   | automation solution for iOS                                       |
| 01:16:34   | and they wanted to offer something cross-platform                 |
| 01:16:38   | if I have my memory of that right.                                |
| 01:16:40   | And that's an issue I'm gonna face if and when I,                 |
| 01:16:45   | for instance, bring Mars Edit to iOS,                             |
| 01:16:47   | then I'm gonna have to look                                       |
| 01:16:49   | at the whole automation situation afresh.                         |
| 01:16:53   | And hopefully some of that will be addressed                      |
| 01:16:56   | by shortcuts, though the cross-platform nature                    |
| 01:16:58   | of shortcuts as of most recent Mac OS is very welcome             |
| 01:17:03   | and it's encouraging for a future                                 |
| 01:17:05   | where we can look forward to cross-platform solutions             |
| 01:17:07   | for many apps, but yeah, the JavaScript approach,                 |
| 01:17:12   | whenever I hear about, I just listened recently                   |
| 01:17:14   | to the recent The Talk Show with John Gruber                      |
| 01:17:18   | and Paul Kafasis and as I was listening to it,                   |
| 01:17:22   | I was like, you know what?                                        |
| 01:17:23   | Maybe I should have a JavaScript interface                        |
| 01:17:25   | because it does make sense.                                       |
| 01:17:26   | It makes a lot of sense.                                          |
| 01:17:29   | It would be, like you said, it's just one item                    |
| 01:17:32   | on my exceedingly long list of things to do.                      |
| 01:17:35   | However, the continued automation of my life                      |
| 01:17:38   | does continue to surprise me                                      |
| 01:17:40   | how many of those things I eventually get done.                   |
| 01:17:42   | Yes, yes, it's always amazing                                     |
| 01:17:44   | how much automation and scripting,                                |
| 01:17:46   | sneaky and even when we're not aware of it.                       |
| 01:17:50   | This episode of Automated is brought to you                       |
| 01:17:51   | by DEVONthink, the flagship product                               |

| 01:18:08   | means you're never looking for something                          |
| 01:18:10   | and not finding it.                                               |
| 01:18:12   | DEVONthink features a flexible sync system                        |
| 01:18:14   | that supports many cloud services                                 |
| 01:18:16   | or lets you synchronise over a local network too                  |
| 01:18:18   | with everything securely encrypted.                               |
| 01:18:20   | That gives you the choice                                         |
| 01:18:21   | for however syncing works best for you.                           |

| 01:18:29   | So your system handles it.                                        |
| 01:18:31   | Let DEVONthink automatically organise your data                   |
| 01:18:33   | with rules you define.                                            |
| 01:18:35   | DEVONthink's AppleScript dictionary                               |
| 01:18:36   | is one of the largest on the Mac.                                 |
| 01:18:38   | There's no part of DEVONthink that can't be automated.            |
| 01:18:40   | Extend DEVONthink's functionality with your own commands          |
| 01:18:42   | by adding them to a scripts menu.                                 |
| 01:18:44   | Even templates can have scripts inside                            |
| 01:18:46   | and you can set up new documents                                  |
| 01:18:48   | with data from placeholders                                       |
| 01:18:49   | or inserted by your own AppleScript code.                         |
| 01:18:52   | And of course, there's so much more.                              |
| 01:18:53   | From an iOS companion app to email archiving, scanning,           |
| 01:18:55   | or even an embedded web server                                    |
| 01:18:57   | sharing data securely with your team.                             |
| 01:18:59   | Honestly, it's hard to pick which feature stands out              |
| 01:19:02   | as the most useful for DEVONthink                                 |
| 01:19:03   | because I use so much of it all the time,                         |
| 01:19:06   | like the batch processing for, you know,                          |
| 01:19:08   | managing a whole group of files                                   |
| 01:19:09   | that I've just decided that I need to import and organise.        |
| 01:19:12   | So simple.                                                        |
| 01:19:13   | You should use DEVONthink if you've got documents,                |
| 01:19:15   | you need to manage them, store them,                              |
| 01:19:17   | and have them organised in the same consistent way                |
| 01:19:19   | in various places and have a system that,                         |
| 01:19:22   | let's face it, has got your back                                  |
| 01:19:23   | when you and your personal filing mess up.                        |

| 01:19:36   | Our thanks to Devon Technologies                                  |
| 01:19:37   | for their support of the show and all of relay.fm.              |
| 01:19:41   | So Daniel, you have, we've been talking                           |
| 01:19:45   | through the show today.                                           |
| 01:19:46   | I feel like we've gone kind of through a little history,          |
| 01:19:48   | kind of getting started with automation,                          |
| 01:19:50   | AppleScript, JavaScript.                                          |
| 01:19:52   | And then at the end of the last segment,                          |
| 01:19:54   | we started to dip our toes into some of the developers            |
| 01:19:57   | starting to actively add shortcut support.                        |
| 01:20:00   | And there definitely feels to me                                  |
| 01:20:03   | like an evolution of automation.                                  |
| 01:20:05   | And last year, WWDC, I believe it was Craig Federighi             |
| 01:20:10   | who said that shortcuts on the Mac                                |
| 01:20:12   | was one more step in their overall automation plan.               |
| 01:20:16   | And to me, that was like kind of shocking                         |
| 01:20:19   | that they have a plan for automation                              |
| 01:20:21   | because it just seemed like they really gave up                   |
| 01:20:25   | on automation a few years ago.                                    |
| 01:20:26   | And I mean, to me, the turning point was                          |
| 01:20:28   | when [[Sal Soghoian]] left the company,                                |
| 01:20:31   | I'm like, well, I guess they just don't care about this anymore.  |
| 01:20:33   | But now suddenly it does seem like there's a plan.                |
| 01:20:37   | What's your insight on that?                                      |
| 01:20:38   | Where do you think this is all heading?                           |
| 01:20:41   | I don't know.                                                     |
| 01:20:42   | I might have more to predict                                      |
| 01:20:46   | if I had Doug Moore into shortcuts myself so far.                 |
| 01:20:50   | I've kind of been like among the many users                       |
| 01:20:54   | who is intrigued by it,                                           |
| 01:20:55   | but then I start using it on the Mac in particular                |
| 01:20:58   | and run into something or other                                   |
| 01:21:01   | that just sort of takes the wind out of my sails.                 |
| 01:21:05   | So I've looked at it enough to be excited about it                |
| 01:21:09   | and where it's going.                                             |
| 01:21:12   | I don't know if, for example,                                     |
| 01:21:14   | the future that Apple has in mind would include more.             |
| 01:21:20   | I could imagine there being like a nesting system                 |
| 01:21:25   | for shortcuts.                                                    |
| 01:21:26   | They already have the ability to run a shortcut                   |
| 01:21:28   | from another shortcut,                                            |
| 01:21:31   | but if you can think back,                                        |
| 01:21:35   | has either of you ever used the Quartz composer                   |
| 01:21:38   | that Apple used to support?                                       |
| 01:21:40   | I vaguely remember playing with this a few times.                 |
| 01:21:43   | It was very much a kind of general purpose,                       |
| 01:21:47   | scripted visual scripting tool for graphics.                      |
| 01:21:52   | And it had nodes kind of like audio hijack                        |
| 01:21:54   | and you'd connect them together.                                  |
| 01:21:56   | And the logic of each node would direct the data                  |
| 01:22:01   | to a different node and you could have nested compositions.       |
| 01:22:08   | I kind of hope that,                                              |
| 01:22:10   | so here's, I guess here's the high level.                         |
| 01:22:12   | Shortcuts is not sophisticated enough yet                         |
| 01:22:16   | to fulfill all the needs of automation on the Mac.                |
| 01:22:20   | I think that's accurate.                                          |
| 01:22:22   | It's probably accurate also that it's not sophisticated           |
| 01:22:25   | enough to cover the needs of iOS.                                 |
| 01:22:27   | It's just as good as it happens to get.                           |
| 01:22:30   | So if you look at shortcuts as a scaffolding for the future,      |
| 01:22:36   | I think you could imagine it getting new logic flow               |
| 01:22:44   | capabilities, like maybe little nodes in the,                     |
| 01:22:49   | I'm gonna open up a shortcut here                                 |
| 01:22:50   | to just kind of prompt my memory.                                 |
| 01:22:51   | But like, yeah, you have like a linear list right now             |
| 01:22:54   | of things in a shortcut.                                          |
| 01:22:57   | And the cool thing about Quartz Composer was                      |
| 01:23:02   | you could kind of have like a two dimensional map                 |
| 01:23:05   | of all the ways that your logic could flow.                       |
| 01:23:08   | And I could see it expanding in that way.                         |
| 01:23:13   | It has the potential to be the kind of tool                       |
| 01:23:17   | like I was alluding to earlier with fast scripts                  |
| 01:23:19   | where it could be simple on the surface                           |
| 01:23:20   | but have depth that's available only if you're interested.        |
| 01:23:25   | So it would be cool if there were like some power user,           |
| 01:23:28   | this idea of like nodes in shortcuts,                             |
| 01:23:32   | you just look for action types and you drag them in.              |
| 01:23:35   | And it would be cool if some of them were like,                   |
| 01:23:39   | run shortcut script, let's say.                                   |
| 01:23:43   | And it's like a text based way to manage all the different        |
| 01:23:48   | shortcut actions you want to invoke and chain together.           |
| 01:23:52   | And maybe it's just run job,                                      |
| 01:23:54   | maybe that's just a JavaScript.                                   |
| 01:23:56   | Maybe there's like a,                                             |
| 01:23:57   | maybe whatever they do for the future of automation               |
| 01:24:01   | involves sort of allowing more powerful segments                  |
| 01:24:06   | in the chain of execution                                         |
| 01:24:08   | that's already there with shortcuts.                              |
| 01:24:11   | Yes, yeah, because right now it's got options to do things        |
| 01:24:14   | like run JavaScript, run JavaScript for automation,               |
| 01:24:16   | run this terminal command and things like that.                   |
| 01:24:19   | But as you say, it is a very linear list.                         |
| 01:24:21   | It reminds me in some ways of the differences between Zapier      |
| 01:24:25   | and make now integral map.                                        |
| 01:24:26   | Zapier just gives you what looks like a vertical list.            |
| 01:24:28   | And there's some if statements and so on in there                 |
| 01:24:32   | if you pay for the advanced stuff you get branching               |
| 01:24:34   | and then make you've got a more visual layout                     |
| 01:24:37   | where it splits things off and goes this way or that way          |
| 01:24:40   | depending on what you're doing and things could run in parallel   |
| 01:24:44   | or it might be an exclusive branching.                            |
| 01:24:48   | And I think that's a very good way to look at it                  |
| 01:24:51   | with how this could get more powerful.                            |
| 01:24:55   | What do you think of automation hooks?                            |
| 01:24:56   | Because that's a notable lacking feature                          |
| 01:24:59   | right now on shortcuts for Mac OS.                                |
| 01:25:01   | iOS has got the automation tab                                    |
| 01:25:03   | where you can hook it into focus modes and arriving places        |
| 01:25:07   | which maybe makes less sense for the Mac                          |
| 01:25:09   | though they do have focus mode automation triggers                |
| 01:25:11   | for location which somewhat baffles me.                           |
| 01:25:15   | Actually the one that baffles me most                             |
| 01:25:17   | is the application trigger for focus modes on Mac OS.             |
| 01:25:20   | So you activate Safari and it activates your focus mode           |
| 01:25:23   | and then you tab away to reply to a message                       |
| 01:25:25   | and it deactivates your focus mode.                               |
| 01:25:28   | And then you tap back to Safari                                   |
| 01:25:29   | and it usually doesn't actually work unfortunately                |
| 01:25:31   | to activate your focus mode the second time                       |
| 01:25:34   | if you do it in fairly short sequence.                            |
| 01:25:37   | But do you think that there's a place                             |
| 01:25:39   | for an automation tab there or similar                            |
| 01:25:42   | or is that something that people should be solving                |
| 01:25:45   | through other scripting methods?                                  |
| 01:25:48   | Obviously file scripts is one way to do this.                     |
| 01:25:51   | And you've got folder actions and stuff built                     |
| 01:25:54   | into the operating system                                         |
| 01:25:55   | or do you think that shortcuts                                    |
| 01:25:56   | should maybe also step up there?                                  |
| 01:25:58   | I think that in general,                                          |
| 01:25:59   | shortcuts should step up everywhere it can reasonably be          |
| 01:26:04   | wherever it can provide parity.                                   |
| 01:26:06   | So that might mean, for instance, one day                         |
| 01:26:09   | when we have shortcuts on our watch,                              |
| 01:26:12   | we don't have shortcuts on the watch, right?                      |
| 01:26:14   | We do have shortcuts on the watch.                                |
| 01:26:15   | It's a relatively recent edition,                                 |
| 01:26:17   | I believe it was iOS 14 that added it.                            |
| 01:26:19   | It's fairly limited.                                              |
| 01:26:21   | It's fairly limited, I have to say.                               |
| 01:26:23   | A lot of things don't run like it.                                |
| 01:26:25   | So it still makes a good example.                                 |
| 01:26:27   | In fact, maybe a better example that it does exist                |
| 01:26:30   | because I think it's okay for it to not step up                   |
| 01:26:34   | in many of the same ways that a shortcut run on iOS               |
| 01:26:38   | or the Mac should behave a certain way, you know?                 |
| 01:26:42   | And, but I'm constantly frustrated                                |
| 01:26:45   | by the little things that Apple has not stepped up                |
| 01:26:49   | to provide parity for between iOS and the Mac                     |
| 01:26:52   | and it comes down to like things as simple                        |
| 01:26:55   | as like setting timers, right?                                    |
| 01:26:58   | Like you can't set a timer.                                       |
| 01:27:00   | Like when they brought Siri to the Mac                            |
| 01:27:03   | and they didn't, you know, so many of the basics,                 |
| 01:27:09   | the things you expect to work on iOS                              |
| 01:27:12   | just didn't work on the Mac.                                      |
| 01:27:14   | I just find that like a missed opportunity.                       |
| 01:27:16   | So I'm not super optimistic                                       |
| 01:27:18   | that they will step up with shortcuts everywhere                  |
| 01:27:22   | to provide that parity,                                           |
| 01:27:23   | but the same way that I think they should support timers          |
| 01:27:28   | that I think they should support                                  |
| 01:27:29   | as much as they possibly can.                                     |
| 01:27:31   | And maybe shortcuts will provide the kind of like enthusiasm      |
| 01:27:37   | and attention to automation                                       |
| 01:27:40   | that actually inspires Apple to want to provide that parity.      |
| 01:27:43   | I can't help but feel like their idea                             |
| 01:27:47   | of the future of automation is more democratic                    |
| 01:27:49   | but less powerful.                                                |
| 01:27:51   | I think that's really where they're heading.                      |
| 01:27:53   | I think you're probably right,                                    |
| 01:27:54   | but I think that's where hopefully somebody at Apple              |
| 01:27:58   | will make the argument and win for that whole idea                |
| 01:28:01   | of simple on the surface,                                         |
| 01:28:03   | but broad and deep where people want it.                          |
| 01:28:06   | You know, just give people the out.                               |
| 01:28:09   | Give people, it's kind of like, you know,                         |
| 01:28:13   | Safari supporting app extensions or Safari plugins.               |
| 01:28:18   | It's like Apple's not going to emphasise                          |
| 01:28:22   | the desire or need to like go install                             |
| 01:28:27   | some random third party, you know,                                |
| 01:28:31   | like the, you know, if eBay has a plugin                          |
| 01:28:35   | or something for Safari, it's like,                               |
| 01:28:36   | it can be simple for everybody except for the person              |
| 01:28:40   | who wants to install a plugin to Safari.                          |
| 01:28:43   | And I think that's, hopefully that's the approach                 |
| 01:28:47   | that they'll take with future automation enhancements as well.    |
| 01:28:51   | Yes, because we do see that, don't we,                            |
| 01:28:53   | with applications like on iOS Toolbox Pro                         |
| 01:28:55   | and on the Mac [[BetterTouchTool]], like they both exist.           |
| 01:28:58   | I mean, Toolbox Pro exists purely to add actions                  |
| 01:29:01   | to shortcuts that wouldn't otherwise be there.                    |
| 01:29:03   | And [[BetterTouchTool]], of course,                                 |
| 01:29:04   | had a pre-existing feature set,                                   |
| 01:29:06   | but it's the one that's added a whole bunch                       |
| 01:29:09   | of different things like execute this keyboard shortcut.          |
| 01:29:12   | That's something shortcuts couldn't do                            |
| 01:29:13   | and [[BetterTouchTool]] now allows it to do.                        |
| 01:29:15   | And I think, you know, I think we will see, you know,             |
| 01:29:18   | developers stepping up to the plate, you know,                    |
| 01:29:20   | you plan to do with file scripts as well with, you know,          |
| 01:29:23   | the extra that we us power users want.                            |
| 01:29:29   | And also what I suspect a lot of people will start with           |
| 01:29:32   | as their solution to the automation problem, you know,            |
| 01:29:36   | because they know that this application                           |
| 01:29:39   | has a keyboard shortcut to do the thing that they want.           |
| 01:29:41   | So the logical solution is to run the keyboard shortcut,          |
| 01:29:45   | you know, if they search for, you know,                           |
| 01:29:47   | whatever the name of the app is, you know,                        |
| 01:29:49   | Chihuahua Amazing app in shortcuts.                               |
| 01:29:53   | Yes, yeah, it's a great app.                                      |
| 01:29:54   | I'm just trying to pick something random                          |
| 01:29:55   | that I know doesn't have shortcut support.                        |
| 01:29:58   | And, you know, so they search for it and they don't have it.      |
| 01:30:00   | So then they find the open app and so they can open the app.      |
| 01:30:03   | Well, that's part of the battle.                                  |
| 01:30:03   | So now how do I do the keyboard shortcut?                         |
| 01:30:05   | You know, that's where they'll Google                             |
| 01:30:07   | how to keyboard shortcut shortcuts.                               |
| 01:30:09   | And that's a terrible thing to have to Google.                    |
| 01:30:11   | You need to stick macOS after it and then still hope              |
| 01:30:14   | that you don't get some blog posts talking                        |
| 01:30:16   | about the keyboard shortcut system preferences pane tap.          |
| 01:30:20   | But, you know, it's something where I think we will               |
| 01:30:25   | be hopefully pleasantly surprised by these things.                |
| 01:30:27   | But I do think it would be nice, especially things like           |
| 01:30:30   | folder actions in Finder.                                         |
| 01:30:33   | It's buried.                                                      |
| 01:30:34   | Like finding that as just a normal user is difficult.             |
| 01:30:37   | My mom had something a little while ago where she was like,       |
| 01:30:40   | whenever I put something in this folder, like it gets zipped.     |
| 01:30:44   | Like, why is that?                                                |
| 01:30:46   | I deleted the folder because it didn't have anything              |
| 01:30:48   | in that I worried about.                                          |
| 01:30:49   | And then I created it and it still happens.                       |
| 01:30:53   | And it turned out she had a folder action attached to it.         |
| 01:30:55   | And I guess like with her deleting the folder                     |
| 01:30:58   | and then creating a new one, you know,                            |
| 01:31:01   | the folder action was still attached to the location rather       |
| 01:31:04   | than the UUID of the folder or something.                         |
| 01:31:07   | I'm not quite sure how that happened there.                       |
| 01:31:09   | But either way, and she was like, what is going on?               |
| 01:31:11   | And I like had to go digging around.                              |
| 01:31:13   | And I eventually found the folder actions menu,                   |
| 01:31:15   | which she claims she's never seen before.                         |
| 01:31:18   | I'm personally skeptical.                                         |
| 01:31:20   | She must have set this up somehow.                                |
| 01:31:22   | And like there was an automated reaction in there                 |
| 01:31:24   | to like make archive or something.                                |
| 01:31:26   | Oh, yeah.                                                         |
| 01:31:27   | How does somebody get an accidental folder action?                |
| 01:31:29   | That's what I want to know.                                       |
| 01:31:31   | You're talking about the woman who periodically turns off         |
| 01:31:34   | like calendar syncing on her iPhone                               |
| 01:31:36   | and swears that she's never opened the Settings app.              |
| 01:31:39   | So I've got no idea.                                              |
| 01:31:41   | Like I've seriously considered using                              |
| 01:31:42   | shortcuts on her iOS device so that when she opens the Settings   |
| 01:31:46   | app, it just like opens messages to me and says,                  |
| 01:31:50   | like, I tried to do something I'm not allowed to do again.        |
| 01:31:53   | I haven't done it because it would actually                       |
| 01:31:55   | prevent her doing things that are necessary.                      |
| 01:31:57   | But like I've seriously considered it a few times.                |
| 01:31:59   | But like, you know, she had no idea theoretically                 |
| 01:32:03   | that this feature existed and that it was doing magic on her Mac. |
| 01:32:07   | And it's difficult to find even if you know it exists.            |
| 01:32:10   | So I'm sure that, you know, having a central place where          |
| 01:32:14   | you could go see all of this stuff and manage it                  |
| 01:32:19   | would be, you know, really useful for people.                     |
| 01:32:22   | Because I think that's the other problem, you know,               |
| 01:32:24   | you've got so many different apps running different things        |
| 01:32:26   | here, there and everywhere, you know,                             |
| 01:32:27   | theoretically running their own magic.                            |
| 01:32:30   | It can be really difficult to, you know,                          |
| 01:32:32   | find out what's causing stuff to happen where,                    |
| 01:32:36   | though I have to say this is where an app I mentioned earlier     |
| 01:32:39   | comes in handy, Backlog.                                          |
| 01:32:40   | It's useful after something's happened.                           |
| 01:32:42   | It can open the console logs for the past                         |
| 01:32:46   | and even for specific applications, which is great.               |
| 01:32:49   | So if I find a bug in Fast Scripts at some point                  |
| 01:32:52   | and you get logs, you'll know it's because it happened            |
| 01:32:54   | and I hit the Backlog and was able to go,                         |
| 01:32:55   | right, show me the Fast Scripts log for the last hour             |
| 01:32:58   | and I'm going to send those over                                  |
| 01:32:59   | because I didn't have the console running.                        |
| 01:33:02   | Yeah, well, I think the only explanation for your mom             |
| 01:33:04   | is that she is suffering slash possibly benefiting                |
| 01:33:08   | from sleep automation.                                            |
| 01:33:10   | Yeah, in the middle of the night, she's getting up                |
| 01:33:13   | and exploring the deep automation capabilities of her Mac         |
| 01:33:18   | and she has no memory of it.                                      |
| 01:33:20   | I would love it if I would just woke up tomorrow morning          |
| 01:33:22   | in my bank would I had an automation                              |
| 01:33:24   | to pull data off my bank website                                  |
| 01:33:26   | and I had no idea how I did it.                                   |
| 01:33:28   | Yeah, I do think that we're in a weird period right now.          |
| 01:33:33   | I think that the automation team is, you know,                    |
| 01:33:36   | primarily shortcuts.                                              |
| 01:33:37   | I think they're, you know, they were given SwiftUI                |
| 01:33:40   | as a platform and they're struggling                              |
| 01:33:43   | to make the best possible app                                     |
| 01:33:45   | with, you know, kind of a developing set of tools.                |
| 01:33:49   | So I don't know what the long-term story is,                      |
| 01:33:51   | but, you know, kind of tying it all together,                     |
| 01:33:53   | I do think shortcuts is going to get better                       |
| 01:33:55   | and more efficient and all of that,                               |
| 01:33:57   | but I also think that there is going to continue                  |
| 01:33:59   | to be this world where Mac users can tap into things              |
| 01:34:03   | like [[AppleScript]] and Apple Events                                |
| 01:34:06   | and iOS users can't.                                              |
| 01:34:08   | And I don't know that Apple's ever really going to be able        |
| 01:34:10   | to fix that at this point.                                        |
| 01:34:12   | Yeah, well, you know, speaking of the idea of having,             |
| 01:34:16   | like if I look at shortcuts right now,                            |
| 01:34:20   | it's already overwhelmed with actions                             |
| 01:34:22   | and they need to do something about this                          |
| 01:34:24   | because like it's really hard to organise and get to              |
| 01:34:27   | like what are the different actions.                              |
| 01:34:28   | And even if you search, it's like run JavaScript.                 |
| 01:34:31   | For instance, I typed in earlier                                  |
| 01:34:33   | while we were talking about that.                                 |
| 01:34:34   | And this, I've already got like one for audio hijack,             |
| 01:34:36   | one for the web, one for JavaScript for automation.               |
| 01:34:42   | Hopefully there will just be so many options                      |
| 01:34:45   | that they'll have to organise this better.                        |
| 01:34:46   | And, you know, I don't know why I kind of,                        |
| 01:34:52   | I think I kind of lost my train of thought there,                 |
| 01:34:55   | started talking about this for some other reason                  |
| 01:34:56   | and now I can't remember what.                                    |
| 01:34:57   | But I don't know, I guess in closing about shortcuts,             |
| 01:35:02   | I would just say, I hope it continues to get attention.           |
| 01:35:06   | It's been nice to see how much little bug fixes are coming.       |
| 01:35:09   | There's a steady stream of little bug fixes.                      |
| 01:35:11   | And hopefully that means that when like WWDC comes along,         |
| 01:35:15   | we'll see like a shortcuts for the Mac 2 or whatever              |
| 01:35:19   | and it'll be something to celebrate.                              |
| 01:35:22   | Yes, yes.                                                         |
| 01:35:23   | And hopefully they'll finally fix that issue that I have          |
| 01:35:26   | where if I download a shortcut                                    |
| 01:35:27   | and it's got an action in that I don't know                       |
| 01:35:29   | and my Mac doesn't know it                                        |
| 01:35:30   | or my iPhone doesn't know it,                                     |
| 01:35:32   | it doesn't just say unknown action                                |
| 01:35:35   | or very occasionally a translation string                         |
| 01:35:37   | because, you know, that's always good fun.                        |
| 01:35:40   | The translation string is for unknown action.                     |
| 01:35:42   | I did report that one a couple of times, I think.                 |
| 01:35:44   | So it's a, yeah, it's all interesting when that happens.          |
| 01:35:49   | Yeah.                                                             |
| 01:35:49   | It would be lovely to have more ways to organise                  |
| 01:35:52   | both the actions inside of shortcuts                              |
| 01:35:55   | and also be able to organise shortcuts by actions and filter      |
| 01:36:00   | for it includes actions from this application                     |
| 01:36:02   | or that application and so on and so forth.                       |
| 01:36:04   | So I could really see, you know,                                  |
| 01:36:06   | what things have I got that could possibly be affecting           |
| 01:36:09   | on me focus or whatever it is that I'm looking                    |
| 01:36:13   | to, you know, do something with.                                  |
| 01:36:15   | I remember now, the reason I started down that path               |
| 01:36:17   | was cause David was saying something about how, you know,         |
| 01:36:19   | these resources on the Mac like running an AppleScript           |
| 01:36:22   | are not going to be made available to iOS.                        |
| 01:36:24   | But I think what can happen is that got me thinking               |
| 01:36:29   | about how there's like a limitless number of new actions          |
| 01:36:33   | that people can add and the AppleScript and stuff like that      |
| 01:36:36   | can sort of fill in the gaps until an appropriate                 |
| 01:36:40   | kind of quote unquote native shortcut action exists.              |
| 01:36:44   | And so I think in that sense, it's like, at some point            |
| 01:36:47   | you'll be able to look at your list of shortcuts                  |
| 01:36:49   | that like work on the Mac, but don't work on iOS                  |
| 01:36:51   | and start asking yourself like, what would it take                |
| 01:36:54   | for there to be a type of action that does this                   |
| 01:36:57   | that would work on iOS and the Mac?                               |
| 01:36:59   | And maybe if it becomes popular enough,                           |
| 01:37:04   | that'll be a kind of a motivator to people, right?                |
| 01:37:06   | And people like you and David who are talking                     |
| 01:37:10   | about the shortcomings of, you know, shortcuts,                   |
| 01:37:13   | we will say, well, there's this AppleScript I rely on            |
| 01:37:16   | that does this thing.                                             |
| 01:37:17   | And if only somebody would make an app                            |
| 01:37:19   | that provides shortcut that does that everywhere.                 |
| 01:37:22   | So I think it's, I love the fact like you said early on           |
| 01:37:25   | that they decided to include AppleScript support.                |
| 01:37:29   | It has the possibility that it will sort of give                  |
| 01:37:35   | shortcuts more viability as it matures                            |
| 01:37:38   | and give it a sort of scaffolding on which to build.              |
| 01:37:41   | Yeah, well, and there's two points on that.                       |
| 01:37:43   | First of all, as you can see this happening                       |
| 01:37:45   | actively right now, if you go into Automator                      |
| 01:37:48   | and you look at the things in Automator                           |
| 01:37:51   | that last year got moved to shortcuts.                            |
| 01:37:54   | There were actions like PDF and file actions                      |
| 01:37:57   | that you know got moved because they're like,                     |
| 01:38:00   | well, we can currently do this with an Automator action           |
| 01:38:03   | which is in essence a fancy AppleScript.                         |
| 01:38:05   | So we've got to build it into shortcuts                           |
| 01:38:07   | but they left some out, you know,                                 |
| 01:38:09   | there's some that didn't make it.                                 |
| 01:38:10   | And like this year, and when we get to June,                      |
| 01:38:14   | well, we see Apple move more from the category                    |
| 01:38:16   | of Automator to shortcuts.                                        |
| 01:38:18   | And then the other thing I think                                  |
| 01:38:20   | that is very illustrative of your point                           |
| 01:38:22   | is this app [[BetterTouchTool]].                                    |
| 01:38:24   | And [[BetterTouchTool]] is an app that was made                     |
| 01:38:27   | to make it easy to, you know, add functions                       |
| 01:38:31   | to your touch bar or to your touch pad                            |
| 01:38:33   | and it's kind of expanded.                                        |
| 01:38:35   | But the developer went nuts with his shortcut support             |
| 01:38:39   | and like things like select an item from the menu                 |
| 01:38:42   | or, you know, like all this stuff that we wanna do                |
| 01:38:45   | that, you know, shortcuts team wasn't given the rope to do.       |
| 01:38:50   | He just added it to his app.                                      |
| 01:38:53   | It has almost nothing to do with what his app does.               |
| 01:38:56   | But suddenly it's like you've got this Trojan horse               |
| 01:38:58   | of actions that you've dropped into your Mac                      |
| 01:39:02   | into shortcuts just by having [[BetterTouchTool]].                  |
| 01:39:04   | So I really think it's, we're at an interesting time              |
| 01:39:07   | and we're all speculating, but I do think                         |
| 01:39:11   | that people who want to automate this stuff                       |
| 01:39:13   | is going to get a lot easier for you in the future.               |
| 01:39:16   | And that's in our hope.                                           |
| 01:39:18   | But either way, Daniel Jalkut,                                   |
| 01:39:19   | thank you so much for coming.                                     |
| 01:39:20   | Now you mentioned your podcast,                                   |
| 01:39:22   | but you're such a classy guy.                                     |
| 01:39:23   | You didn't even say the name.                                     |
| 01:39:24   | It's called Core Intuition.                                       |
| 01:39:25   | It's an excellent application.                                    |
| 01:39:27   | I'm an excellent podcast and you can go in there                  |
| 01:39:30   | and Daniel has, I mean, the reason I love having him              |
| 01:39:33   | on our show is because he's got this insight                      |
| 01:39:35   | of someone who likes to automate                                  |
| 01:39:36   | but also writes automation tools.                                 |
| 01:39:38   | Well, you get that inside every episode of Core Intuition.        |
| 01:39:41   | So we're gonna put a link in the show notes for that.             |
| 01:39:44   | Thank you.                                                        |
| 01:39:45   | We'll also put a link in for Red Sweater Software,                |
| 01:39:48   | which is, you know, where all these great apps are.               |
| 01:39:50   | Anywhere else people should look for you, Daniel.                 |
| 01:39:53   | Oh, well, if you just wanna get like my less professional         |
| 01:39:56   | side, you can find me on Twitter, Daniel Punkass.                 |
| 01:40:00   | That's kind of the breadth of most of my stuff                    |
| 01:40:03   | is either Red Sweater or kind of being a smart alec               |
| 01:40:07   | on Twitter, so.                                                   |
| 01:40:09   | Simultaneously the best and worst Twitter handle                  |
| 01:40:13   | of any of my friends, I'll have to say.                           |
| 01:40:15   | It really, it's funny, I will say really quickly                  |
| 01:40:20   | I had a cause this past weekend for several local news stations   |
| 01:40:25   | to get in touch with me about an accident                         |
| 01:40:27   | that I witnessed on a highway around here.                        |
| 01:40:30   | And to have to explain to all of them                             |
| 01:40:32   | what my Twitter handle is, to spell it out for them,              |
| 01:40:35   | it's always kind of fun.                                          |
| 01:40:38   | Well, thank you so much for all the hard work you've done         |
| 01:40:41   | for our community of Automators and Fast Scripts                  |
| 01:40:45   | is just an excellent app, Rose and I both use it                  |
| 01:40:48   | if you're listening to Automators, go check it out.               |
| 01:40:50   | And as Daniel again mentioned, but was too nice                   |
| 01:40:54   | to explain, you can use Automators for free.                      |
| 01:40:57   | He's got a lot of features in there                               |
| 01:40:59   | that you can just download the app and start using it.            |
| 01:41:01   | And I'd recommend you do that.                                    |
| 01:41:02   | And if you'd like it, you know, register                          |
| 01:41:06   | and give Daniel some money, cause it's a great app.               |
| 01:41:09   | Anything else, Daniel, any other places people find you?          |
| 01:41:13   | No, you know, I have some blogs, but my blog is,                  |
| 01:41:16   | my main blog, I haven't written as much as I should               |
| 01:41:18   | as the developer of a blog editor, but my main                    |
| 01:41:22   | technology blog is bitsplitting.org.                              |
| 01:41:26   | It's kind of like my home base really on the web, I guess.        |
| 01:41:31   | So between that, Twitter and my company website,                  |
| 01:41:33   | redsweater.com, you'll find plenty                                |
| 01:41:36   | to hopefully state your curiosity.                                |
| 01:41:39   | There you go.                                                     |
| 01:41:40   | And in the after show today, we're gonna talk                     |
| 01:41:43   | to about Daniel's ninth grade automation,                         |
| 01:41:45   | cause this is a good story.                                       |
| 01:41:47   | So for the supporters, we'll be talking about that.               |

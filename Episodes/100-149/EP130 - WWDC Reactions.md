| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to Automators. I'm David Sparks and joined by my co-host, Rosemary Orchard. Hello,                |
| 00:07      | Rosemary. How are you today? Hey, David. My batteries are running pretty low right now because            |
| 00:12      | I'm the idiot that installed all the betas, but I'm pretty happy apart from that. So I feel,              |
| 00:17      | I feel I'm pretty good. How about you? Oh, when you said my batteries were running low,                   |
| 00:20      | I was getting worried. I was thinking that like the bigger sense of the term, like you're really          |
| 00:24      | tired, but no, you're... No, no. I mean, we all have low batteries during beta season, especially         |
| 00:29      | crazy nerds like us. I love it. I just got back from [[WWDC]]. Saw a bunch of friends there and               |
| 00:34      | they're all software developers and smart, fancy people who say, oh, I remember when I was young,         |
| 00:40      | like in my teens and twenties, I didn't sell the betas. Now I'm wiser. I never do that. And I was         |
| 00:45      | thinking to myself, I'm in my fifties and I still install the betas and I love it. And I have lots        |
| 00:50      | of batteries, so I don't care. But anyway, this is the morning that we get to open the Automation         |
| 00:55      | Christmas presents for you. Apple just had the [[WWDC]] event. They have an automation story. There           |
| 01:02      | is automation news this year. It wasn't part of the keynote. What didn't feature is heavily,              |
| 01:08      | but there's a lot going on. Rose and I are going to break it all down for you. What's coming with         |
| 01:13      | the betas, what we like, what we don't like. And also we've got some other stuff to weigh on,             |
| 01:19      | on some other news and automation related stuff going on. So we got a full show for you today.            |
| 01:24      | I guess we should just get started. Yeah, I guess so. Otherwise, we're not going to have time because     |
| 01:29      | I mean, we've got like 15 pages of notes on shortcuts just to start us off, haven't we?                   |
| 01:34      | Yeah, but yeah, I just realised I'm being a bad podcaster before we get started.                          |
| 01:38      | For those of you that are Automators Max supporters, that's the bonus version of the show.                |
| 01:43      | Gets you some extra content, gets rid of the ads. We'd love to have you join. You can do that at          |
| 01:48      | the web page for relay.fm slash Automators. But we're going to go through both of us, or at least          |
| 01:55      | I know I am seriously, once again, looking at [[Stage Manager]]. I got motivated by Apple, of course.         |
| 02:02      | Anytime you go up to Cupertino and bathe in the reality of storage and field, you come back with          |
| 02:08      | all these great ideas. But we're going to talk about that in Automators Max today, ways that you          |
| 02:12      | can use [[Stage Manager]] to be efficient. And it's an experiment at this point, but I want to talk           |
| 02:16      | through it. Yeah, I mean, I think it's actually a great experiment and a great place to start, David,     |
| 02:21      | because shortcuts had some updates. You know, they didn't necessarily get a lot of keynote time,          |
| 02:25      | but some of those updates include new automation triggers in [[Shortcuts]] and improvements to existing       |
| 02:31      | automation triggers. And one of those triggers on the iPad is when [[Stage Manager]] turns on,                |
| 02:38      | or when [[Stage Manager]] is turned on, or when [[Stage Manager]] is turned off. So clearly,                      |
| 02:42      | they want us to be using [[Stage Manager]]. And that is, you know, an automation trigger. And that one        |
| 02:48      | can be run immediately. They've changed the ask before running toggle to be called run immediately,       |
| 02:54      | and run after confirmation as like a list that you can choose from. And so you can say that this          |
| 03:00      | one should run immediately. And then it pops up a little prompt and says, Hey, do you want it to          |
| 03:04      | like ask you or not? And then it automatically turns off the notify when run thing, which is              |
| 03:10      | what previously happened as well. But this is great because, you know, when [[Stage Manager]] turns on,       |
| 03:15      | you can then, you know, run a shortcut. And speaking of which, you know, I kind of,                       |
| 03:21      | I mean, two minds as to which way to go, but the automation like system as a whole has a huge             |
| 03:27      | improvement. Now, when I tap on that next button, oh my God, it suggests I run a shortcut. I'm just       |
| 03:34      | so happy with this. I personally think that this is what should have been there from the start.           |
| 03:41      | I understand why it wasn't. But now, when you set up an automation, it prompts you,                       |
| 03:46      | you can have a new blank automation. And then it has like a list of your folders with tiles.              |
| 03:51      | Fortunately, for those of us with other 1000 shortcuts, 1580 at last count, there's also                  |
| 03:57      | a search button. So you can search for your shortcut. But this is great because it all ties               |
| 04:02      | in together with all of those automation improvements. Yeah. Well, let's just slow down                   |
| 04:07      | and back up a little bit because I want to cover some of this stuff in more detail. But                   |
| 04:10      | the [[Stage Manager]], and just for you, dear listener, Rose and I both have all the betas loaded.            |
| 04:17      | We are recording on machines that are not on the beta because you have to record and you                  |
| 04:22      | don't want the recording to fail. But I've got my Sonoma MacBook in front of me. And I can confirm        |
| 04:29      | that the [[Stage Manager]] setting is also on the Mac, which is great. We don't always get these              |
| 04:34      | actions on all platforms. But one of the nice things is if you want to play with [[Stage Manager]] now,       |
| 04:40      | you can set a shortcut to toggle it on and off. Like when I record screencast, I don't leave it           |
| 04:45      | on because I think it's too noisy and that gets in the way of the video product you're making.            |
| 04:51      | But I always had to do that with a bunch of keyboard shortcuts and other nonsense.                        |
| 04:55      | Now I can just run it as a step, an action and shortcut. So that's really great. And you can              |
| 05:00      | do the same thing on your iPad. So if you want to run shortcuts, and it's not really related to           |
| 05:06      | automation or automators, but a [[Stage Manager]] got a lot better on the iPad. And by better,                |
| 05:15      | the big change to me is they've made it easier to make multiple sizes of windows before you were          |
| 05:20      | very limited in what you could do. Now you've got a lot more variety. It still is a fixed window.         |
| 05:26      | It's not like on the Mac where you can make any size window down to the pixel.                            |
| 05:30      | But it's enough of gradiation that you can really make just about anything you want.                      |
| 05:36      | Yeah. And I think this is a really big improvement. There are certain apps that just kind of              |
| 05:41      | never really looked right unless they were full screen. And I've noticed those looking a little           |
| 05:45      | better now, which is great. So yeah, it's good to see [[Stage Manager]] integrating with shortcuts in         |
| 05:53      | all of the ways. But it's not the only thing because one of the things that they were talking             |
| 05:59      | about when they introduced [[Stage Manager]] for iOS 16 was the fact that when you connect it to an           |
| 06:04      | external display, the external display can be using [[Stage Manager]] and this is really going to             |
| 06:08      | improve your productivity on iPad. Well, they kind of decided that they needed to add some                |
| 06:13      | automations for this. So another automation trigger that we now have is when my display connects.         |
| 06:19      | So when a display connects or disconnects from the iPad, you can run a shortcut,                          |
| 06:24      | which could, for example, turn on [[Stage Manager]]. Or it could turn on your work focus mode or              |
| 06:30      | something if you only dock your iPad to an external monitor in the office, for example.                   |
| 06:34      | But this is really cool. I really like the fact that there are two really great automation triggers       |
| 06:39      | right there, both of which can run immediately and you can just run shortcuts from them.                  |
| 06:43      | Yeah. Now, I want to back up even further structurally. Shortcuts look different now.                     |
| 06:49      | And when you go to add an action specifically, they are really aiming to bring in non-supernerd           |
| 06:58      | users to do more with shortcuts. So when you go to add an action, it makes app suggestions that           |
| 07:05      | are based on the app. So right now, I just open mine and I haven't got a shortcut started. I've           |
| 07:12      | got a test one that's empty and it's giving me suggested actions in the clock, in [[Drafts]], in              |
| 07:18      | notes, in voice memos. All the built-in Apple apps begin with because we're on the beta.                  |
| 07:25      | But as I understand it, the developer API lets the developer choose specific actions that are             |
| 07:31      | ready to roll in that actions menu now. So a user can just tap it and they've got a shortcut              |
| 07:37      | without any work whatsoever. And I think that's going to really be a nice entry point for people          |
| 07:42      | getting started. It really is. And these app shortcuts are being brought to users in other                |
| 07:49      | ways as well. So if you open [[Spotlight]], for example, and start searching for say books,                   |
| 07:55      | then you'll see those things pop up in [[Spotlight]] as well. And they pop up as kind of like cute            |
| 08:01      | little rounded icons. So if you think of an app icon, it's colourful. So in the case of the books          |
| 08:07      | icon, it's an orange rounded square with a white book on it. Well, the shortcut icons which appear        |
| 08:12      | so next to it are round gray icons with a, I think it's black or exceptionally dark gray                  |
| 08:18      | icon on top of it. And it will say like open current and play current. So you can play your               |
| 08:21      | current audiobook or open your current book. And that's just some of the ways that they're                |
| 08:26      | really bringing these shortcuts into everybody's front of mind. And of course, inside of shortcuts,       |
| 08:32      | if I tap on the book section, I can disable those appearing as [[Spotlight]] or Siri. But the                 |
| 08:38      | fact that they're there and the clock app and so on has got these as well. So does files for              |
| 08:45      | scanning a document. It's really nice to see Apple not just releasing a feature, but going like,          |
| 08:50      | hey, you should use us. And for existing non-Apple apps, it does a good job of showing not just           |
| 08:57      | apps, but app suggestions within those, like those that don't have the big Apple block behind them        |
| 09:04      | already have really discoverable features. I happen to own a trigger barbecue,                            |
| 09:10      | Rose. That's the nerdy barbecue with an app. And I was just going through it and it's like,               |
| 09:15      | oh, what's the current temperature of my meat? I can find out now. I can just push a button               |
| 09:20      | and create a shortcut for it. So I feel like this is exactly what we need. The idea behind                |
| 09:25      | shortcuts is that it has a nice easy on ramp that people can start making very basic shortcuts            |
| 09:30      | with no training. And every year, they get a little closer with that. And this year,                      |
| 09:34      | they made progress on that too. There's more though, structural change. I feel like,                      |
| 09:40      | and I don't have the story of this, I was trying to track down some shortcuts people,                     |
| 09:45      | but they weren't as public this year. So you didn't see as many of them. At one point, I saw              |
| 09:51      | a few friends on shortcuts, but they were across the way from me. So I couldn't get to them before,       |
| 09:56      | you know, in the sea of people. But it's running faster. I feel like many of my shortcuts that            |
| 10:02      | seem like they're slow are running faster on beta one, which is not something I expected. Are you         |
| 10:07      | experiencing that too? I am experiencing that. Not only am I experiencing that, I'm also experiencing     |
| 10:14      | things like weights and so on work for longer. So I think what's happened and this is speculation         |
| 10:21      | is that under the hood, they've just gone in and like they've maybe not rewritten things,                 |
| 10:27      | but they certainly had a big refactor of just tidying up all the bits that we're kind of linking          |
| 10:31      | together in a crisscross fashion, kind of like you might wrap ribbons around a maple. And they've         |
| 10:36      | kind of maybe just straightened some things up and gone, okay, well, this links directly to this          |
| 10:40      | and this. So we're just going to feed that straight through and see what happens. And bam,                |
| 10:44      | we have super fast shortcuts. It is like they are on something in the best of ways. So yeah,              |
| 10:53      | I'm really excited by that. I really feel like across the board, not just in automation, but              |
| 10:58      | just in general, the software updates this year feel, I think the theme of the year is quality            |
| 11:04      | life improvements. It's like lots of little things that make it easier to use these things and            |
| 11:10      | lots of friction points sanded down and shortcuts is no different. And that faster bit, I think           |
| 11:17      | there must have been a lot of optimisation going on in the past year because it was immediately           |
| 11:22      | noticeable to me. Some of my longer shortcuts just run better. And so far, knock on wood, we're only      |
| 11:28      | in beta one, some of my more complicated ones seem to be more stable. I haven't had any break yet,        |
| 11:35      | but I haven't gone through tests at all of mine. And I'm sure there are some actions that are             |
| 11:39      | probably not working. That's always the case during beta. I just haven't personally bumped                |
| 11:43      | into any. Have you had any fail on you yet? Well, I didn't have shortcuts specifically fail on me,        |
| 11:50      | though I did have some automations fail. I had shortcuts fail on me. And so for anybody else              |
| 11:56      | who has the beta installed, I sincerely hope you're an app developer and you're using this because        |
| 12:01      | you're actually doing something with this. If not, please wait until the public beta. You                 |
| 12:06      | do not want to do this to yourself. But every time I tried to open shortcuts on my iPhone, it             |
| 12:11      | crashed. I want to say it crashed. I mean, I'd see the screen for like a second and a half and then       |
| 12:17      | bam, closed, gone. And I mentioned this on iOS today when I was reporting that right after                |
| 12:24      | [[WWDC]], because I restored my phone, tried a number of things to help and none of it worked.                |
| 12:30      | And somebody reached out to us and mentioned if you've got SOFA installed, which is a great app           |
| 12:37      | for like tracking what you're going to like watch next, listen to next, play next, etc.                   |
| 12:43      | Then that might be causing the crash. Try uninstalling it. So I uninstalled SOFA and shortcuts            |
| 12:48      | on my iPhone now works. So I've reached out to the SOFA developer because I'm pretty certain that         |
| 12:52      | there is just basically an edge case in one of their shortcut actions that is kind of like causing        |
| 12:57      | this somewhere. And I don't think it's entirely on them to fix, but I followed feedback and I've          |
| 13:02      | reached out to the SOFA developer to say like, hey, heads up, this is a thing. Just so that people        |
| 13:08      | know and then fingers crossed that can be fixed for folks. But yeah, so I had that like not work          |
| 13:13      | and then in turn, some of my automations worked. Some of them didn't. And like I don't quite know         |
| 13:20      | exactly what the cause was there. Was it that shortcuts was like trying to like start up                  |
| 13:24      | and couldn't because it was running into some kind of error and then crashing out or was it               |
| 13:31      | you know, the actual shortcuts themselves that was running as automations that were broken.               |
| 13:37      | But the good news is is, you know, most things have been working just fine, you know, like my             |
| 13:40      | widgets that I've got through push cut and so on have been updating and things like that. And I do        |
| 13:44      | all that through shortcuts. So I feel like I've I've got off pretty lightly all things considered         |
| 13:50      | with this. I know certainly when I snoozed my alarm yesterday morning, my evil alarm clock,               |
| 13:56      | thanks to signal for home kids, certainly did its trick of flashing all of my lights all the              |
| 14:01      | different colours. So that worked. I know because it flashed the horrible shade of green and I             |
| 14:05      | went, okay, fine, I'm going to get up. So my punishment whenever I hit snooze, my lights                  |
| 14:11      | flash in different colours in the bedroom. We are definitely going to do future content once the           |
| 14:16      | betas get more mature and report in on that. And this is kind of the first pass. But one of the           |
| 14:22      | things I am most excited about is that they have removed some of the automation barriers this year.       |
| 14:30      | Wi-Fi in particular is what I'm excited about. Now, historically, if you hit a new Wi-Fi network,         |
| 14:35      | you needed to confirm before you could run an automation. And now there's a toggle and you                |
| 14:42      | click it. And when you go to work and you connect to the work Wi-Fi, a you can have a shortcut run        |
| 14:47      | without bugging you. Now, it will give you a notification that it ran. But as far as I can                |
| 14:53      | tell, you can't avoid that. But it's early in beta. So maybe that'll change. But then that's              |
| 14:58      | probably for the best that you get to know. But I'm fine with a notification because now I don't          |
| 15:02      | have to push a button to make it go. And I think this is great. And this will be something we             |
| 15:08      | talk about in future shows. But just think about it. Wi-Fi automation as a trigger without a confirmation |
| 15:16      | can really change your game. If you get your iPad to work and you connect to the work                     |
| 15:23      | Wi-Fi, then suddenly you can do this. The world is your oyster. You can set your focus mode.              |
| 15:27      | You can set [[Stage Manager]] on or off just like we just mentioned. You can do so many different             |
| 15:32      | things just merely by showing up in the office. It really is the kind of thing that we love here          |
| 15:37      | on the Automated Podcast. Yes. And I suspect the reason why Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have now both got         |
| 15:44      | these automation triggers where you can turn it off and you'll get it to run immediately,                 |
| 15:47      | you cannot turn off the notification is because particularly in the case of Wi-Fi, assuming               |
| 15:52      | that it's using the network name to check it, my network name is something I said. My home                |
| 15:58      | network is called the Promised Land. Yes, I'm a nerd. I make jokes. It's funny, at least in my head.      |
| 16:04      | But anybody else could create a Wi-Fi network and call it the Promised Land. And if I had an              |
| 16:09      | automation step for that and then my phone connected to that network, then it would also                  |
| 16:16      | run that. Now, they could have actually created a network, assuming that they managed to do it            |
| 16:21      | with the same password and everything, then it would just basically be mimicking my network               |
| 16:25      | and my phone would connect to it. Now, I actually do this on purpose because I have a travel              |
| 16:31      | router, which I take with me when I travel that mimics my home network because it can                     |
| 16:35      | like rebroadcast hotel Wi-Fi. It's great for things like the Chromecast or something                      |
| 16:39      | that's connected to the hotel TV. But if somebody had done that maliciously to run my                     |
| 16:46      | shortcut that was on my phone that they probably didn't have access to, maybe that would be a             |
| 16:50      | problem. Maybe it wouldn't be. But I understand why in the purposes of it's going to send you             |
| 16:55      | an automation. Apple have gone with, okay, well, we'll let people run it automatically,                   |
| 16:59      | but they're getting a notification whether they like it or not. So yeah, it's pretty cool. And            |
| 17:04      | quite a few things have got that as well. So physical location has not had this option                    |
| 17:11      | added for that. But email and message also got the same when like automatic running.                      |
| 17:20      | Now, I will say you can't just have a message or an email automation run for like every single            |
| 17:27      | email or message from a contact. You do have to set it up with like a filter in it to like                |
| 17:32      | search for some text, but you can then run this automatically, which is pretty darn cool.                 |
| 17:37      | Yeah. I mean, and those are two that I, if you had said, hey, you got a bet of $1,000,                    |
| 17:43      | are they ever going to let you do an automatic automation upon receiving a message?                       |
| 17:48      | I would have said no, that they're just never going to let you do that because                            |
| 17:52      | then someone else in the world by the mere act of sending you a message is able to                        |
| 17:58      | cause something to happen on your device. Well, we're all big boys and girls.                             |
| 18:03      | We're okay with that. But I just feel like Apple would never let us do it. And they did. So I'm           |
| 18:07      | very happy about that. David, can I just take a moment to be very European and say, please,               |
| 18:11      | can you tell your cell phone carriers this because they charge you to receive text messages? Like         |
| 18:16      | you have a limited number of messages that you can send and receive. Most people are probably on          |
| 18:19      | plans where they've just got unlimited, but like you actually have to pay to receive a message.           |
| 18:24      | And I just don't understand that I have zero control over somebody else sending me messages.              |
| 18:29      | So why should I have to pay for it? Like it should be on them. I have a similar                           |
| 18:33      | relationship with email, but I pay with my time that with my money. Yes. Yes. That's a great              |
| 18:40      | new update. And I honestly did not expect any of those things to get a run immediately without            |
| 18:46      | confirmation. And that if that's all we got this year, that's a win.                                      |
| 18:53      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN. You probably wouldn't take a call             |
| 18:58      | on a public place on speaker for anyone to hear because you'd be concerned about your privacy,            |
| 19:02      | right? Well, using the internet without ExpressVPN is a bit like taking that call and knowing someone     |
| 19:07      | could eavesdrop if they wanted to. Internet service providers can actually see all the websites you       |
| 19:11      | visit and that data could be sold to others who might use that data to target you for marketing.          |
| 19:16      | Thankfully, you can use ExpressVPN, which creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and       |
| 19:21      | the internet so people can't see your online activity. It's super easy to use too. Just fire up           |
| 19:26      | the app and hit one button. It works on phones, laptops, even routers. So everyone who shares             |
| 19:31      | your Wi-Fi can be protected. It's no surprise ExpressVPN has been rated number one by Business            |
| 19:36      | Insider and The Verge. One of the things that I love about ExpressVPN is the fact that I can              |
| 19:41      | easily see where I'm connecting the end of my tunnel to. So if I want to be in Paris, for example,        |
| 19:47      | then I can do that. And that's one of the reasons why it's important to me to use ExpressVPN,             |
| 19:53      | because not only can it help me get around weird content blockers that block my access to sites           |
| 19:58      | like relay.fm, but it also lets me check out Netflix and so on in those other countries.                  |

| 20:26      | So David, there is another automation trigger that's been added to shortcuts that we're going             |
| 20:31      | to have to talk about, because it's there on the iPhone, it's there on the iPad, and it's something       |
| 20:36      | people have been asking for, it's transactions. So when you use your Apple wallet to pay for              |
| 20:42      | something, so Apple Pay, and you select your card, you can select run immediately, that's fine.           |
| 20:49      | You can choose to notify when you're running, and then you select what kind of transaction. So            |
| 20:53      | there's payment, public transport, or I presume public transit, if you're in the US, access               |
| 20:58      | e-money and identity. And so depending on what you use, like your wallet for, then you can have           |
| 21:08      | it automatically, for example, log commuting when you do a public transport transaction.                  |
| 21:15      | So if you wanted to track your time with Timery and time spent commuting as one of those things,          |
| 21:21      | then you could say, okay, so when I use a public transport type of transaction                            |
| 21:27      | on this card in Apple Pay, I want you to start a Timery Timer, and then when I connect to my work         |
| 21:33      | Wi-Fi, I want you to stop the Timery Timer for commuting, then you can do that. That's now possible       |
| 21:40      | without you having to tap to run a single automation. And that's amazing.                                 |
| 21:44      | Yeah, it is really great. And the great thing about shortcuts as the app developers are giving            |
| 21:50      | us actions that we can do things, but Apple has so much power. When they give us triggers like this,      |
| 21:57      | it just makes everything else so much better, right? We can make more happen because now we've            |
| 22:03      | got a system level trigger that only Apple can give us. And yeah, I never even thought of this as         |
| 22:10      | being a trigger. I guess my brain was not expansive enough. But when I saw it, I'm like, yes, please.     |
| 22:16      | And it's like there's, like you said, there's so many different ways in your everyday life,               |
| 22:21      | you can use this. I can't help but wonder if this is somehow related to the journal app,                  |
| 22:25      | that they have the log information for the journal app and they went ahead and said,                      |
| 22:29      | well, let's give them a shortcut trigger too. But I mean, I don't know, that's just speculation.          |
| 22:34      | But whatever the reason is, I'm thankful for it. And I can't wait to start writing some                   |
| 22:39      | shortcuts around that action or that trigger. Yeah. I should note that if you select the                  |
| 22:44      | payment transaction type, then you get to choose from a variety of categories, including food and         |
| 22:50      | drinks, shopping, travel, services, entertainment, health and transport. And so these are the             |
| 22:56      | automatic categorisations that Apple give you for this stuff. Unfortunately, when I checked it out        |
| 23:02      | last time, just trying to check it out again, just to make sure that I'm right. Obviously,                |
| 23:07      | we're still on beta one here as we record. So it's entirely possible that things will change.             |
| 23:12      | I believe the shortcut input doesn't provide you with any information. No, it does not. So,               |
| 23:17      | yeah, you're just kind of going to have to guesstimate what something is based on logic,                  |
| 23:25      | like getting your current location maybe. But at the same time, it's a start. So you're not               |
| 23:29      | going to have the amount that you paid or the vendor that you paid to, but you are going to have          |
| 23:33      | the fact that a transaction happened. And it could always prompt you to insert the balance                |
| 23:38      | into whatever finance tracking app that you're currently using if you wanted that.                        |
| 23:43      | There's other goodies we got as well. One of the ones that I'm kind of excited about                      |
| 23:50      | is that now you can run a shortcut from your lock screen.                                                 |
| 23:53      | Yep, new lock screen widget. I would say finally, but I get why it's taken them a                         |
| 23:59      | little while to add it because... It's only been a year.                                                  |
| 24:02      | Yeah, it's only been a year. And especially with all the other features that they've been                 |
| 24:06      | working on, I get it. They've been making other improvements. And so, yeah, you can just add              |
| 24:16      | a widget to your lock screen, which you can now do on the iPad as well as the iPhone and have it          |
| 24:22      | run a shortcut. And so the icon it gives you is going to be a circle with kind of the shortcuts           |
| 24:26      | icon inside of the circle. And then the icon of your shortcut overlaid on that top square of              |
| 24:32      | the shortcuts icon. So it's going to be kind of small and not that obvious. But speaking of widgets,      |
| 24:40      | David, did you notice there's a new small widget for shortcuts?                                           |
| 24:44      | And oh my God, everybody's been wanting this. Shortcuts has now got a small widget that can               |
| 24:50      | run two shortcuts. Yeah. And it never made sense to me that the small widget can only run one             |
| 24:55      | shortcut. So they've added the density. My answer to this is yes and more, please.                        |
| 25:00      | Double the number of shortcuts you can run on all the widgets. Make the medium one run eight and          |
| 25:07      | make the, just give us more. What I would really love, and I do potentially understand why they           |
| 25:15      | wouldn't do this because it could result in slightly too small app icon sizes. But also,                  |
| 25:21      | that's kind of my choice is if I have a small widget that takes up four app squares, let me run           |
| 25:27      | four shortcuts. If I have a medium widget that takes up eight app squares, let me run eight               |
| 25:33      | shortcuts. You see where I'm going with those with all the widget sizes? Like just give me the            |
| 25:37      | number of shortcuts widgets because don't forget, there is also that magic Siri widget.                   |
| 25:44      | Now, this is a Siri suggestions widget, which you can find if you go to add widgets. And you'll           |
| 25:49      | find this on iOS 15 as well, where if you scroll down to Siri suggestions, there is a magic one           |
| 25:55      | for app suggestions, which just puts four app icons on your home screen, or sorry, eight app              |
| 26:00      | icons on your home screen. It's a medium-sized widget. You can actually stack it with another             |
| 26:04      | medium-sized widget if you wanted to. And so because of that, or at least you could, it's now             |
| 26:12      | not stacking for me on this one. But either way, because you can have those eight suggestions,            |
| 26:17      | I feel like eight shortcuts, that shouldn't be out of the realm of possibility. So yeah, I don't          |
| 26:22      | know. iOS 18 feature request slash homework for the shortcuts and the operating system team,              |
| 26:29      | if they can manage it. I feel like you could always create apps of shortcuts if you wanted.               |
| 26:36      | Yeah. This is true, but you can't have them dynamically update unless you just do it by                   |
| 26:41      | home screen. And then even then, you're not necessarily going to have all the shortcuts                   |
| 26:45      | that are in a folder or something at your disposal. Exactly. There's a cost to that. And                  |
| 26:51      | you're stuck with what you put there. And so I agree with you that that could be something. I             |
| 26:58      | understand though why they make it big. They want to make it user simple. I feel like a lot of our        |
| 27:03      | listeners have probably had this experience. I just did it for a family member recently. She              |
| 27:07      | had a little problem that I could solve with a shortcut. I made the shortcut. I made the widget.          |
| 27:12      | It's a big button on her screen. She doesn't have two shortcuts. She has one shortcut. So                 |
| 27:18      | once this comes out, I'll have to figure out, maybe I'll make a call David button and put it              |
| 27:23      | there. The one shortcut widget is still present. So there's not going to be a problem for her.            |
| 27:30      | I have a similar thing with my ballet teacher where she needed a little shortcut that I threw             |
| 27:34      | together for her really quickly at the end of class because the name of the exercise that we              |
| 27:39      | were doing was listed after the name of the song, which is great if you know that this piece of music     |
| 27:44      | is great for plies, but really bad if you need to tap onto the piece of music, then immediately           |
| 27:50      | hit pause so it doesn't start playing and then wait for it to slowly scroll across the screen.            |
| 27:56      | And she's got an old iPod touch. So I think it was running like iOS 15 or something or even 14.           |
| 28:01      | I don't know. It wasn't running the latest and greatest, but I was able to create a quick shortcut        |
| 28:05      | for her. And I used add to home screen in that case. I didn't try and do widgets. I just blended          |
| 28:09      | it in with everything else. So she knows the pink button is for that stupid album that's                  |
| 28:12      | named incorrectly. And yeah, it solved the problem. But yeah, putting things on the home screen, I        |
| 28:17      | think is a lot more user friendly for many people. I've finally slowly talked my parents into,            |
| 28:24      | if you don't need it regularly, it doesn't deserve a space on your home screen, put it in the app         |
| 28:28      | library, find it through the big list later. But it's taken a while to convince them that they            |
| 28:33      | don't need it all in endless screens and folders on their home screen.                                    |
| 28:38      | Another one I'm looking forward to exploring and working with is the scan document shortcut,              |
| 28:44      | you know, in terms of building your own receipt capture shortcut. But that was a good one.                |
| 28:50      | Yes. There's a several of them that don't really land for me, but I'm sure they scratch an itch           |
| 28:56      | for a lot of people and they're like hotspot related ones. You can get a password or set a                |
| 29:01      | password for hotspot. And also there are user cellular actions like reset your cellular data,             |
| 29:09      | you know, toggle your cellular plan. Yeah, which I think is really useful,                                |
| 29:13      | especially considering the fact that for some reason, my iPad didn't connect to Wi-Fi. And so             |
| 29:17      | it like went through and used five gigabytes of data. And I have most of the months left to go.           |
| 29:24      | So the fact that I can have my iPad reset its cellular usage automatically at that point in               |
| 29:29      | the month and I can do it on my iPhone as well means I'm actually going to reset my cellular              |
| 29:33      | data statistics and use that. And similarly, toggling the cellular plan, not so much something that I     |
| 29:41      | need, but for example, something that somebody who has a work phone or a work sim and a personal          |
| 29:47      | sim. Exactly. And their devices, you know, I can imagine wanting to do that and enjoying doing            |
| 29:54      | that as well. So yeah, it's pretty cool to see that these things are coming. And then there's             |
| 30:00      | just some really simple actions as well that they've added like delete alarm and things like that.        |
| 30:06      | So you can tidy up your alarms a lot more easily instead of having to like                                |
| 30:10      | ask Siri to delete all your alarms and then like using the donated one. That's pretty nice.               |
| 30:16      | Yeah, a lot of people are excited about those alarm actions. And I don't, because I'm pretty,             |
| 30:22      | I use the same alarms all the time. So I'm not, that's not as big of a deal for me. But going back        |
| 30:26      | to the cellular one, I was also thinking if anybody like commutes between countries, and you've got       |
| 30:31      | a two cellular radios, like one for one country and one for another, now you could set a shortcut to      |
| 30:38      | make that switch for you automatically when you get on the plane or get off the plane. And                |
| 30:43      | if you go even a little further, maybe you could use one of these new triggers to make that happen.       |
| 30:48      | So I definitely see space for that. And I think just, you know, this is the problem when you              |
| 30:55      | write and talk about this stuff, it's easy to live in your own little bubble. You've got to               |
| 30:59      | realise, you know, there's a lot of people out there and there's a lot of problems. And                   |
| 31:02      | the shortcuts team is not just trying to take care of Rose and David's little                             |
| 31:06      | pet issues. They've got other fish to fry. Yes. Also, I love David that you assumed that people           |
| 31:13      | were commuting between countries by plane. That maybe giggle. Yeah, that's an American thing,             |
| 31:20      | right? It's very American. I used to live like on the border of France and luxmbourg from Germany.       |
| 31:28      | And for a while I lived in luxmbourg and you could genuinely be in four countries                        |
| 31:33      | within a couple of hours and have stopped for ice cream and chips in different places on the way.         |
| 31:38      | I almost kind of caught myself. I was actually trying to be not an American in the way I said             |
| 31:45      | that, but I actually managed to do it anyway, didn't I? Yes, that's okay. But one of the things I         |
| 31:53      | wanted to go back to actually is specifically the clock actions. There's actually a really great          |
| 31:59      | post on Reddit that's gone through and talked about how the new clock actions work and so on.             |
| 32:05      | So you're able to edit your sleep alarm. And this is really nice. Now, I should note editing              |
| 32:11      | your sleep alarm is only available on iPhone. Sleep things are iPhone only. They're not available         |
| 32:15      | on other devices, which means I didn't get my sleep focus mode on my iPad, even though I wanted one,      |
| 32:21      | but that's okay. And so what you can do with sleep alarm is you can skip it. You can unskip it or         |
| 32:27      | you can toggle it. And that's all you can do. But at least you can skip it or unskip it if you've         |
| 32:34      | got a shortcut. It's going to be like, oh, tomorrow is a different day. So I'm going to skip my sleep     |
| 32:38      | alarm. I'm going to set a new alarm and so on. One of the things I do at the moment, and I've             |
| 32:44      | really struggled with this because I have ended up doing what felt like the worst thing ever,             |
| 32:50      | is I have just got a shortcut that goes through every day. And it looks, so when my work focus            |
| 32:56      | mode starts, it looks at the events in my calendar. And it makes sure that it's not getting anything      |
| 33:01      | that's canceled. And it makes sure that it's not getting like events where I'm actually physically        |
| 33:06      | going to be in an office. And then it goes, okay, cool, I'm going to create an alarm three minutes        |
| 33:13      | before each of these events for you. So that then when my alarm goes off, I know, okay, cool,             |
| 33:18      | like I've got three minutes, I can grab a glass of water, run to the bathroom or whatever, five           |
| 33:22      | minutes, it's just long enough that I'll be like, I can quickly finish this thing and run to the          |
| 33:26      | bathroom and get water. And long story short, five minutes is never enough to do all of those things.     |
| 33:31      | So, but now I can use the find alarms feature, which is using a feature that was added to shortcuts       |
| 33:37      | in iOS 16 to be able to sort of expose data in a way that you can then filter stuff. And I can use        |
| 33:43      | find alarms to find the alarms for my repeating calendar events. So instead of adding a new alarm         |
| 33:48      | for every calendar event, so that I have stand up 17 bazillion times in my in my alarms list,             |
| 33:55      | I can just find the stand up alarm and turn it on because at the same time every day,                     |
| 34:00      | I can find the juggling alarm return on the same time every day. And if for whatever reason,              |
| 34:04      | it's a different time, I can then delete it, which is great. So I am pretty happy with that,              |
| 34:10      | because that's going to really clean up that shortcut. And then hopefully I can write that                |
| 34:13      | up and share that with folks. So yeah, this is going to be really, really useful for a number             |
| 34:19      | of things. And there, there, there's even more, there's actions being discovered. I wish Apple            |
| 34:24      | did a better job of saying, here's everything that changed in shortcuts. Well, they do,                   |
| 34:29      | but they only do it when the release goes public. Yeah. So there's a great page that they                 |
| 34:34      | is shortcuts team update every time a release happens, but they don't release it with for the             |
| 34:40      | like they don't update it for the beta, they update it for the public release or just off to the          |
| 34:44      | public release. And I wish there was like a developer version of this page or like a beta                 |
| 34:50      | version of this page where we could see the beta stuff coming. So shortcuts team, if you're               |
| 34:54      | listening and the PR folks will let you do that, please, pretty please. I would really love it.           |
| 35:00      | Like maybe make it a secret action that's only available in shortcuts if you're on the beta.              |
| 35:04      | I'm fine with that. Like, I just love to know officially what's, what's supposed to be there              |
| 35:09      | and so on. But I guess the other problem is like the clock actions that maybe hopefully wasn't            |
| 35:13      | the shortcuts team knows the clock team, which is great because then the shortcuts team have              |
| 35:16      | more time to do shortcut stuff. And also sometimes stuff they put in the early beta doesn't make it       |
| 35:23      | to release. And I'm sure they, they're not so, so eager to write a lot about something that may not       |
| 35:29      | survive. I wanted to take a minute though to talk about things that are not in                            |
| 35:35      | the update. I know I had a few little pet issues that I was looking for. So this is my chance to          |
| 35:41      | whine about it. I was, I was really disappointed in some of the lack of parity between devices.           |
| 35:50      | I have been running all sorts of automations to, you know, set up my Mac to do things. And I love         |
| 35:58      | tab groups in [[Safari]] on the iPad and iPhone. There's an action that says open a tab group,                |
| 36:03      | and it's perfect. It just really, it makes doing things like setups really easy. And it's not been        |
| 36:09      | on the Mac now for a year. And I kept thinking, well, it'll be, it'll come in WBC. I'm sure it's          |
| 36:14      | in next year's release because they did it already. They made it for the iPhone and iPad.                 |
| 36:18      | Um, there's not, it's not easily addressable via [[AppleScript]] to do this on the Mac. There's not          |
| 36:24      | really like an alternate route short of like the goofy thing and keyboard mice where you have a           |
| 36:29      | look for the word on the screen, which, you know, really is dependent on a lot of things happening.       |
| 36:34      | And that didn't come over. So we did not get open a tab group on [[Safari]], even though it's been on         |
| 36:40      | the iPhone and iPad for a while. So I'm a little sad about that. Another one that is the same             |
| 36:47      | situation is open a specific email box. I use the [[Apple Mail]] app, and I love the idea of a                |
| 36:52      | shortcut that can open me to a specific mailbox to keep me focused and on target. We've got it on         |
| 36:58      | mobile. We didn't get it on the Mac again this year. So those were two I immediately look for.            |
| 37:03      | I'm sure I'll find a few more as we work through the betas, but it's like some of these I can't,          |
| 37:07      | but wonder how did that not happen? It seems like they've already done the work,                          |
| 37:10      | but maybe the Mac is different enough that it's not that easy to pull it over.                            |
| 37:14      | Yeah, I don't know if that's the case. I mean, I feel like there's some things that have made it          |
| 37:20      | so shortcut actions for health are available on iPad because the health app has come to the iPad.         |
| 37:25      | Yay, simple sleep focus mode is still not available as a trigger in the automations list for              |
| 37:32      | I don't know what reason. Like I understand that on, you know, sleep is related to health and that        |
| 37:39      | was originally only on the iPhone and you set your sleep schedule in the health app on the iPhone         |
| 37:45      | and it ties in with the Apple Watch. But I would still like a trigger for the focus mode turning          |
| 37:51      | on and turning off because that's like the start and the end of my day or the end of the start            |
| 37:55      | of my day if I'm going to get it the right way around. And it would be really, really useful              |
| 37:59      | to have those like properly like on top of each other like there so that then, you know, it's             |
| 38:05      | the start of my day. My iPad can set me up for my day, but I currently can't do that. And like I          |
| 38:12      | have to proxy like it by like turning to another focus mode which wastes the focus mode because           |
| 38:18      | it's like, okay, sleep mode turning on is good turn on this focus mode and then like set a                |
| 38:23      | [[Data Jar]] variable and then the automation runs on my iPad and so it flips back to sleep focus mode.       |
| 38:29      | And then like it doesn't run again because it checks and it's like, okay, this variable is already        |
| 38:33      | there in [[Data Jar]]. Like we're not going to do it again. And it's just kind of janky and horrible          |
| 38:38      | as I've given up on doing that. And yeah, I just have to live with my iPad not doing like a reset         |
| 38:44      | of rotation lock and silent mode at the end of the day at the moment, which is a shame because            |
| 38:49      | it really pucks me when I forget to turn those off and I'm sitting in one room and I can't move           |
| 38:53      | to the other room to go and just turn off silent mode or turn on silent mode on my iPad and I can         |
| 38:58      | hear it dinging repeatedly. Yeah. Yeah. So that that's sad. And I'm actually going to submit              |
| 39:04      | feedback on that and I'd recommend everybody that does want features that they're missing,                |
| 39:09      | including maybe you feel strongly about tab groups and email boxes. Just submit feedback                  |
| 39:15      | to Apple if you're on the beta and let them know. And hopefully, you know, sometimes things do            |
| 39:21      | change between beta one for the better and the end. I was just gonna say if you're not on the             |
| 39:25      | beta, so you can still go to apple.com/feedback to file feedback. If you are on the                 |
| 39:30      | betas, then obviously you can use feedback assistance to do the feedback assistance to do                 |
| 39:34      | that. There is a way to open feedback assistance if you're not on the beta, but you can just go           |
| 39:38      | to apple.com/feedback and it'll do the same process. So yeah, file feedback.                        |
| 39:43      | And on the focus modes, I just really, really wanted more focus, let's say, I don't know,                 |
| 39:49      | because I got spoiled because we got focus modes two years ago. And then the following year last          |
| 39:55      | year we got a bunch of improvements of focus modes and I felt like, man, it's like if you're              |
| 39:59      | playing darts, you're getting closer and closer to the bullseye. And this year they didn't really         |
| 40:03      | do much, didn't throw many darts at the bullseye for focus modes. We didn't get more. We still            |
| 40:08      | can't use contact groups and stuff that I think would be low hanging fruit for it. None of that           |
| 40:13      | happened. So hopefully next year, I'd hate focus modes to be a thing that just kind of stops evolving     |
| 40:20      | because it's such a great idea. And at a time when our technology is increasingly                         |
| 40:27      | interfering with our ability to do our best work, I feel like this is apple doing the right thing.        |
| 40:32      | I just hope that continues. Yeah, me too. And I got really excited for a moment because I was just        |
| 40:37      | going through and like trying to use groups and contacts. And I realised that there was a select          |
| 40:42      | contacts like bar across the bottom. So I tapped it. And I realised that it's telling me to select        |
| 40:47      | contacts. And if I select one, two or three contacts, it'll tell me like one contact selected,            |
| 40:52      | two contacts selected, and so on. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, they just, that hasn't got there yet,                 |
| 40:58      | but hopefully we'll know anything else on your list of sad things that you didn't get that you            |
| 41:04      | wanted or I mean, I'm sure I'm going to come across things. But at the moment, I'm just trying to         |
| 41:09      | focus on like the fact that we got all this cool stuff, some of which like some people have been          |
| 41:14      | asking for, and some of which some people hadn't been asking for. And I'm really excited quite            |
| 41:20      | frankly, in the way this all ties together. So we haven't got to some of the other awesome new            |
| 41:25      | features yet, like interactive widgets. But a lot of this stuff is built around app intents,               |
| 41:30      | which is the, you know, fancy new shortcut things that we got last year. And something else that          |
| 41:37      | I saw that is pretty cool, is that there is a shortcut action for open collection in the                  |
| 41:41      | tips app. Now I know a bunch of you will be like, Oh, the tips app, great. But developers now have        |
| 41:47      | the option to add their own tips for their own apps into the tips app, which mean, and they can do        |
| 41:53      | it in their own apps as well. So that when you interact with an app, it can like explain to               |
| 41:57      | you how stuff is working, using the tips framework. And then you can open those tips in the tips app      |
| 42:02      | from shortcuts. And I'm really loving the continuity and the way that this stuff all ties in together.    |
| 42:09      | You know, they're not just going, Okay, so we're going to just do this thing so that app developers       |
| 42:13      | can tell people how to use their apps. They're also going, Okay, so we're going to put it into the        |
| 42:17      | tips app, which means that people are hopefully going to find it because they automatically put           |

| 46:01      | All right, Rose, we're the Automators podcast, but I felt like we had to get Rosemary Orchard's           |
| 46:06      | opinion on all this new hardware because there's a lot. I mean, there is and I'm excited by it,           |
| 46:12      | but also I don't know if I'm like, I don't know if I can buy it. I mean, I could buy a Mac Pro.           |
| 46:17      | I don't need a Mac Pro, but I don't know. Like the Vision Pro, that's only coming to the U.S.             |
| 46:23      | to start with. Like I'm gonna have to come on holiday to the U.S. when it's my birthday and buy           |
| 46:26      | one if it's coming out then. So yeah. Hey, you sleep on my couch. We got a local Apple store.             |
| 46:31      | Take it out, get you set up. Sounds perfect. Yeah, I'll wear my P-Calc t-shirt in all the colours.         |
| 46:38      | Yeah, I guess I've spoken enough about the new hardware that I feel like the MacBook Air is               |
| 46:44      | in nice addition with a larger screen. It's not going to set the world on fire, but I think it's          |
| 46:49      | a necessary piece of the line. I'm happy that the Mac Studio, it got an upgrade to M2, you know,          |
| 46:58      | although I think I'm going to buy one. That's a whole other thing. I mean, I already have a Mac           |
| 47:02      | Studio and like I don't plan on updating to the M2. Like I don't see a reason. I didn't buy like a        |
| 47:09      | super powerful Mac Studio. I just bought the Mac Studio, but the Mac Studio is great. It is genuinely     |
| 47:14      | a lovely computer. I feel like it's actually the pro computer. Most people probably want a need           |
| 47:20      | unless they've got like a need to add, you know, like multiple different network cards and graphics       |
| 47:25      | cards and use those PCIe slots. But yeah, like I can say for some people who maybe bought an M1           |
| 47:31      | Mac Mini and are there going, oh, I feel like I should have more power. You know, they're running         |
| 47:37      | into the limitations with stuff, which yes, believe it or not, can happen. I think the M2 Mac Studio      |
| 47:43      | is going to be a really nice choice. I mean, I think it's particularly if you're running an Intel         |
| 47:47      | desktop Mac. It's a great computer. I have no business buying one, to be honest. I have an M1             |
| 47:55      | MacBook Pro, but it's been sitting in clamshell running for six months. The first time I unplugged        |
| 48:02      | it was to take it to Cupertino with me and I never opened it. I used my MacBook Air for the whole         |
| 48:07      | trip. So I would like to, and the M1 MacBook Pro still has a good resale value. So it wouldn't cost       |
| 48:13      | me that much to get the, you know, I would also get the lower in Mac Studio, but I just kind of           |
| 48:18      | liked the idea of having a true desktop Mac on my desktop. So I'm probably going to do it. But            |
| 48:24      | that was, I didn't expect that. But here we go, right? The Mac Pro, we've talked about it on              |
| 48:31      | NPU. I'm sure you've talked about some of your channels too, but it's a very niche computer.              |
| 48:37      | It's a niche for a niche. And if you need it, you know that. If you don't know if you need it,            |
| 48:42      | then you don't need it. I think that's my summary of that. Yeah. Yeah. I would agree. It's one of         |
| 48:48      | those things. A lot of people, I'm very sure, like, yeah, I need the Mac Pro. And I would advise          |
| 48:54      | everybody before spending a large amount of money on whatever it is, because we're going to get to        |
| 48:58      | some other stuff that's going to cost money in a bit, that you evaluate whether or not you                |
| 49:03      | really need it, because you may be able to save a chunk of cash and buy a Mac Studio instead.             |
| 49:09      | Yeah. I mean, it's like, it's a $3,000 tax just to get the Mac Pro in it with the exact same stats        |
| 49:16      | as a Mac Studio. The automation story for the Vision Pro is something I try to keep an ear                |
| 49:23      | to the ground for. And I didn't mention at the top of the show. I didn't think I was going,               |
| 49:27      | but I got invited, I think in the second round, you know, I'm like the guy, you know, when you            |
| 49:33      | have a wedding and you've got like Uncle Ralph and you're like, you know, he's a cool guy, but            |
| 49:38      | he's not that cool. And then a bunch of people like turn you down and you're like, well, we got           |
| 49:43      | room. Let's invite Uncle Ralph. I was the Uncle Ralph of WWZ. I got invited with the second round,        |
| 49:48      | but it was fun being there. And I was listening to people talk about this Vision Pro and what's           |
| 49:54      | the automation story about it? Like one of the things I heard, and I wasn't able to get Apple             |
| 49:58      | to confirm it to me, is that if you put the Vision Pro on in a different room,                            |
| 50:04      | it, you can have a different setup in it. Like if you were in your office, you'd put it on and            |
| 50:08      | it would automatically be set up for office mode. And if you put it on in your living room, it'd          |
| 50:13      | be automatically set up to watch movies. And I, two people told me that I didn't get anybody              |
| 50:20      | from Apple to tell me that. But that kind of, that's the kind of automation stuff I'm actually            |
| 50:24      | kind of interested in with this new hardware. And, you know, shortcuts was not one of the                 |
| 50:29      | icons on the screen. But I do think there's an automation story around this device once it gets           |
| 50:35      | out into the wild. Definitely. And we're six months out from release as well on that. So I                |
| 50:40      | feel like there's going to be more coming. And I feel like the, the different room thing actually         |
| 50:45      | ties into another new iOS feature that we haven't talked about yet, which is the standby mode.            |
| 50:51      | Now, there's not a lot of automation to this, but theoretically, and I really struggle to test            |
| 50:57      | this because I have numerous max save chargers at home, but my home is very physically small.             |
| 51:01      | So I could understand if my phone doesn't necessarily know that I'm in different room. But                |
| 51:04      | if you put your iPhone running iOS 17, and you put the standby mode enabled in the settings app,          |
| 51:11      | and you put it on a max safe doc, and you put it on the max safe doc in landscape mode,                   |
| 51:15      | and it's locked, then it'll turn into like an always on mini sort of display.                             |
| 51:19      | Or I could do things like show your calendar, weather, you know, current time, it's got a                 |
| 51:24      | beautiful animation for a little float time. I love that I've been using that while I work,               |
| 51:28      | says a clock in front of me and it animates. It's so beautiful. And that can theoretically                |
| 51:34      | remember different max safe chargers and go to a different like user interface on each one.               |
| 51:42      | Now, I've not yet managed to like figure out if it's actually remembering yet that, or if it's            |
| 51:48      | just like remembering the last one, I need to like start writing down with a notebook,                    |
| 51:52      | like what it's set to on this one, and then like take it off, and then walk into a different room,        |
| 51:57      | and then sit down and like put it on the doc and then see what it comes up with.                          |
| 52:01      | And that's gonna be kind of difficult, like a little travel over the next couple of weeks.                |
| 52:05      | But yeah, it's really cool that they are, you know, they're starting to think about                       |
| 52:09      | in different contexts, you want your phone to do different things, and they brought this out with         |
| 52:13      | the focus modes, and then they've extended focus modes. And now there's also standby.                     |
| 52:17      | And, you know, a vision pro will hopefully also remember, okay, well in this room, they usually           |
| 52:22      | do it like like they're usually watching a movie. And in this room, they're usually working. So we're     |
| 52:26      | gonna like pop up these things in this room and that thing in that room. And then hopefully shortcuts     |
| 52:30      | can pop in to help you tie it all in together. So that you can say, Hey, I want to open these             |
| 52:34      | three apps on my vision pro. Or this is my favourite movie mode, like this is my background that I         |
| 52:40      | want for this. This is how much I want like the, the, you know, the background taken out of my,           |
| 52:47      | my, you know, I range or my site, the line of sight, that's the one. And how big I want the movie         |
| 52:56      | screen to be and things like that. And that would be really cool. Like I don't know if the                |
| 53:00      | shortcuts team have been working on vision pro. I know I saw some, some friends get really excited        |
| 53:07      | when vision pro was announced, because some of the stuff that they've been working on was I'm             |
| 53:11      | guessing in it, because they were excited and they were going, Hey, like the thing that I've been         |
| 53:16      | working on is, is finally like it's coming out. And it's like, yes, I'm really excited for those          |
| 53:20      | folks. But yeah, it's, it's really exciting to see that coming. And I'm really glad that it's             |
| 53:25      | good time with the Mac as well. So you can kind of like take the screen of your Mac and put it            |
| 53:29      | somewhere else using the vision pro, because I think that that's going to, that combined with,            |
| 53:33      | you know, iPhone and iPad apps being able to run on it is going to give it a lot more power               |
| 53:37      | at the start than other things. That said, it sadly comes with a pretty hefty price tag.                  |
| 53:41      | Yeah. The whole standby thing, when we saw in the keynote, I'm like, Oh, that's interesting,              |
| 53:46      | but I wasn't that excited about it. But now that I'm home and I've got it running,                        |
| 53:51      | it's really nice. You know, I mean, if you, if you keep your phone on a stand,                            |
| 53:57      | like you can have it as very, there's a lot of different widgets you can choose from. Like                |
| 54:02      | mine today, I'm not sure why, because I haven't changed anything, but went into a photo mode where        |
| 54:06      | it gives me some of my favourite photos with the time and the date the photo was taken. That's             |
| 54:11      | really cool. But I also like having a nice clock with the calendar. I've talked about how I turned        |
| 54:16      | my iPad into a status board at my desk. Well, this is like a smaller version of the status board,         |
| 54:21      | and it allows me to take some of the widgets off the iPad and use the iPad real estate for                |
| 54:26      | something else. So it's just really nice. And like you said, it'll remember which                         |
| 54:33      | charging puck you're connected to. So if it's next to your bed, maybe it's a simpler widget where,        |
| 54:38      | you know, it's just the clock. And at night, it does, if you, if you set, put the settings right,         |
| 54:43      | it'll switch it to red. So it doesn't like light up your bedroom. In fact, you can also make it so        |
| 54:48      | it only shows up when it detects motion. So yeah, I really like that. Yeah. Cause I, I, I struggle        |
| 54:56      | a little bit with light in the bedroom or from trying to sleep, you know, really, you know,               |
| 54:59      | it does wake me up. And I usually wear my Apple watch while I sleep. So I don't get the benefit           |
| 55:04      | of nightstand mode from it. But this is really cool because last night I got up to go to the              |
| 55:09      | bathroom and I was like, Oh, my phone screen is not on. I wonder, you know, what time it is,              |
| 55:13      | because running the beta Apple watch ultra ran out of battery surprise. So that was also                  |
| 55:18      | on charge on the dock. But it's kind of like behind it on the stand that I've got. And I went             |
| 55:24      | over to my iPhone. I did not touch my iPhone. I did not touch the table. The floor in this room           |
| 55:28      | is nice and solid. So it wasn't that. And I just kind of like reached from my phone and the screen        |
| 55:33      | turned on. I could see the time and that was it. And it was like, Oh my God, this is amazing. And         |
| 55:38      | I love it. Because like, and then I walked away and it turned off really quickly as well. And             |
| 55:41      | it's like, okay, that is super cool and super powerful. I really, really like that. So yeah,              |
| 55:48      | like the fact that it's there, it's just great. Yeah. And the widgets, there's a remarkable               |
| 55:54      | number of available widgets. I've got some feedback going in like, for instance, I feel                   |
| 55:59      | like the clock and the and the, I'm sorry, the appointments and the reminders widget,                     |
| 56:04      | the text is too big. It's not, you know, you can't read them all. But so there's little things I          |
| 56:09      | think they need to make adjustments on. But those are just what's available on beta one.                  |
| 56:13      | As I understand it, third party developers will be able to get in on this too. So that's                  |
| 56:17      | going to be really nice. And like, if you like OmniFocus, you'll have your OmniFocus                    |
| 56:22      | tasks show up as opposed to [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] or whatever. Or you're running timer timer. I just really like      |
| 56:29      | what they've done with that. And it was a thing that I didn't expect, but it is delightful.               |
| 56:33      | Now I want to switch back also to the vision pro because you were talking about it.                       |
| 56:38      | My theory on the vision pro is that it is, you know, the big question is what's it for? I feel            |
| 56:44      | like I talked to numerous people at at Cupertino. I was in the media room, a bunch of friends and         |
| 56:50      | people who I don't know personally, but who I met while I was there, who are like industry                |
| 56:56      | specialists got in on the magic beta. They only did it for a couple of days and there were long           |
| 57:01      | demos. So there was only a few people that could get in. But everybody I talked to that did it was        |
| 57:05      | super impressed with the technology, even the people who are not supposed to be impressed                 |
| 57:10      | with stuff, right? You know, the serious media types. And the question though always becomes,             |
| 57:16      | well, what are you going to use it for? And that is the question that Apple has to answer. And I          |
| 57:21      | feel like more than any other product that Apple's ever made, this is the one that's going to have        |
| 57:27      | the most answers, different answers. Like into the watch, it started out, is it a fashion thing?          |
| 57:33      | Well, it turns out it's a fitness and health thing. That's really what it's for. Maybe a                  |
| 57:36      | notification thing for some people. But this thing I think is going to be a way to watch football         |
| 57:42      | for some people. And it's going to be a way to do productivity stuff for others and a way to watch        |
| 57:48      | movies. I mean, they've got these kind of different demographics of users. So my question for you,        |
| 57:55      | Rosemary Richards, based on what you've seen so far, is there an itch that that's would scratch for       |
| 58:00      | you? I think there's potentially a couple. So I don't travel as much as I used to, but I do               |
| 58:06      | still travel a fair bit. And one of the things that I, or I say things, bags that I have to lug           |
| 58:13      | with me when I travel, if I'm planning on doing any work is the portable office. Okay. So just to         |
| 58:21      | get folks a bit of a rundown, the portable office includes obviously a laptop. It also includes a         |
| 58:25      | Keychron keyboard, a mouse, portable monitor, portable monitor stand, laptop riser, and potentially      |
| 58:32      | microphone, XLR interface, [[Stream Deck]], and things like ethernet cables, cables to connect                |
| 58:38      | portable monitor to the laptop, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is a lot of gear. Now,              |
| 58:44      | I'm not imagining that I can get rid of the microphone and the XLR interface if I'm planning              |
| 58:48      | on doing any podcasting. But I'm definitely imagining laptop riser, portable monitor,                     |
| 58:54      | portable monitor stand, and those associated cables could go bye bye. And then I could potentially        |
| 59:00      | use the Vision Pro with a laptop and have multiple monitors. And I wouldn't have to worry about,          |
| 59:05      | you know, getting the laptop up to an ergonomic height or anything. And that keyboard and mouse           |
| 59:10      | would then also be able to work directly with the Vision Pro for input purposes, which would be,          |
| 59:15      | you know, pretty, pretty cool. But this would then also allow me to ditch things like I usually           |
| 59:20      | take a Chromecast with me rather than the Apple TV just because it's physically smaller. But if I,        |
| 59:25      | you know, I have taken Apple TVs with me when traveling before. And so I wouldn't need that               |
| 59:29      | either because I could just sit in bed with the Vision Pro on and watch probably a better screen          |
| 59:34      | than there is in the hotel room after I spent five minutes futzing with the TV to try and get             |
| 59:38      | its term to Chromecast input. And ended up using my portable monitor anyway. And things like that.        |
| 59:44      | So yeah, I can imagine there would be great for things like that, but also just, you know,                |
| 59:48      | movies and so on. If you're a single person, and or you live alone, and you don't, like,                  |
| 59:57      | have like a space to put a TV necessarily that's convenient, you know, there are some home layouts        |
| 01:00:03   | that just don't really work for that. Or, you know, you're going to have other needs for this.            |
| 01:00:08   | Then I could imagine the Vision Pro being a really great, you know,                                       |
| 01:00:13   | you know, watching thing. I'm probably still going to stick with TVs in various rooms because I           |
| 01:00:18   | kind of tend to put them on and then like get on with doing things like folding laundry and so on.        |
| 01:00:22   | And I can imagine that trying to fold laundry with the Vision Pro on your head                            |
| 01:00:25   | is probably going to get kind of heavy and achy kind of quickly. But yeah, I think there's going          |
| 01:00:30   | to be a number of uses for it. I would love to try it and see like how it works with like my              |
| 01:00:36   | laptop and so on when I'm working, you know, as my day job as a developer. See if I can get               |
| 01:00:41   | some more windows floating around, you know, stick the console somewhere where it's,                      |
| 01:00:45   | you know, it's there so I can see it, but it's even less taking up space than it currently is.            |
| 01:00:50   | Yeah, the other thing everybody who tried it on and went through the demo told me is that they            |
| 01:00:54   | are going to get one. I mean, I think it's a, it's a very good demo. For me, that I think the case        |
| 01:01:01   | is the productivity primarily, like I was thinking, I love thinking about problems and thinking them      |
| 01:01:06   | through visually. And I was thinking, what if I could have on my face something that felt like an         |
| 01:01:13   | 18 foot, you know, square, OmniGraffle diagram to like think through a problem or a free form or          |
| 01:01:21   | whatever. I like that stuff about it. But I think, you know, the content consumption story is very        |
| 01:01:27   | easy to like, why not watch Star Wars in like an IMAX size screen with the, with the space field          |
| 01:01:35   | in the middle of a space field, you know, you could do that. And I, when I was talking to                 |
| 01:01:40   | the people that tried it on, I said, when you went in full virtual mode, how believable was it?           |
| 01:01:45   | And that to me is a big deal because I've tried the Oculus thing and it doesn't feel believable.          |
| 01:01:50   | It's like the, the, the latency combined with the low pixel count, it's, you know, you're in a            |
| 01:01:57   | simulation and it's very, it's, your brain is not tricked, I guess is what I would say.                   |
| 01:02:02   | Yeah. And David underscores Smith, you know, the, the Watch Smith and Widgetsmith guy told me             |
| 01:02:10   | when he put it on at one point they had him on top of Mount Hood and he looked down, he was on            |
| 01:02:14   | the edge of a precipice and he's afraid of heights. And he said, he said, I thought I was                 |
| 01:02:18   | going to die. He said, it's my, my whole, you know, my adrenaline system, everything kicked in            |
| 01:02:24   | because my brain was completely fooled, you know, and that, that's what I like here. I mean, not          |
| 01:02:30   | that I don't want David to be scared, but I just, you know, the idea that I could be at a cabin           |
| 01:02:34   | at the top of a mountains or somewhere in Yosemite writing a [[Day One]] draft and I would, I              |
| 01:02:39   | would be very comfortable doing that. So, so I'm excited about it too, but you know, there's a lot        |
| 01:02:44   | to be said and I do think though, as an automator, I think we're going to find ways to automate this      |
| 01:02:50   | thing. If anybody does, it'll be you and me, Rose. Yeah. I'm really hoping that I'm going to be able      |
| 01:02:54   | to get my hands on one fairly early on. I'm going to have to see obviously pricing and availability.      |
| 01:03:01   | It's only coming out in the U.S. to start with early next year is what they said.                         |
| 01:03:05   | Um, so yeah, like, and also if I buy one, like it's three and a half thousand dollars,                    |
| 01:03:11   | I am not just going to trust some random postal service to like ship it over. It'll be a case             |
| 01:03:16   | of like, I'm going to fly over and pick this one up and fly back. Yeah. Well, I mean, like,               |
| 01:03:20   | normally I would just like ship it to you, right? Like I did that for the iPad for some friends in        |
| 01:03:25   | Europe that they wanted one that wasn't available. So I bought one here. They reimbursed me and I         |
| 01:03:30   | shipped it to them. But the other thing is I understand the fit of these things is super important.       |
| 01:03:35   | And I think you almost want to go in and get properly fitted and make sure that it fits your              |
| 01:03:39   | face. You don't want it to get shipped all the way. Well, there's the optional extra strap going          |
| 01:03:42   | across your head, across the top of your head and so on. Um, and there'll be the, the, like,              |
| 01:03:47   | because you can swap out like the, the, um, uh, visor is the wrong word for it, but like the part         |
| 01:03:53   | that actually like connects between your face and the display to be, to be different ones,                |
| 01:03:57   | I feel like that that's definitely going to be a case of, yeah, like go in store and, and get this        |
| 01:04:03   | all set up and so on. Just like, um, you know, the watches where if you want one of the solo straps,      |
| 01:04:08   | like you should go in store really and try it on if you can so that you get a good fit because            |
| 01:04:13   | otherwise, you know, what you think is going to be a good fit. It often ends up fortunately,              |
| 01:04:17   | Apple has free returns with doing a bit of back and forth of, okay, I ordered the five. Uh,               |
| 01:04:22   | I'm guessing based on the feel of this, I probably need what, maybe a four or three,                      |
| 01:04:25   | so whatever three that's too tight and you have to send it back and get a four and you should             |
| 01:04:29   | probably have ordered four in the first place. But yeah, it's, it's, uh, yeah, it's going to be           |
| 01:04:33   | interesting, but I feel like the good kind of interesting and I, um, really looking forward               |
| 01:04:39   | to seeing how many apps are available at launch. Um, because, uh, I mean, it's kind of a shame.           |
| 01:04:45   | He called out Apollo for Reddit, uh, in so many times and places and it was there as like little          |
| 01:04:50   | app icons on the screen in so many places and Apollo has unfortunately since had to announce              |
| 01:04:55   | that they're going to close down, but that is a great example of an iPhone and iPad app that,             |
| 01:05:00   | you know, could potentially just have worked on the vision pro and so fingers crossed things              |
| 01:05:05   | like OmniFocus will also just work on the vision pro. Um, and that is something that I could imagine     |
| 01:05:11   | being really useful. I'm looking forward to seeing if things like [[Taskheat]] and so on work. That's a      |
| 01:05:15   | really sort of visual way of like interlinking and planning your tasks where you can have lots of         |
| 01:05:21   | dependency. So like these three things have to be done before I can do this thing. And when that          |
| 01:05:25   | thing is done, these five things can be done. Um, and so on and so forth. Um, and I would really          |
| 01:05:30   | like to be able to kind of like plan my day out or plan out complex projects and something like           |
| 01:05:34   | that in like a nice big 3d environment where I can just be like, okay, dump a pile of tasks over          |
| 01:05:39   | here and then like, let's start picking them up and sorting them out and putting them in places           |
| 01:05:42   | and see what happens. Yeah. And what I'm, what I'm most excited about, frankly, is the apps that          |
| 01:05:46   | don't exist. It's the apps that would only make sense in this 3d spatial computing platform that          |
| 01:05:53   | nobody's thought of yet. And I can tell you, having been on the ground in Cupertino this week,            |
| 01:05:58   | that there are a lot of people, the smart people that are doing something like that.                      |
| 01:06:05   | So, uh, there's a couple of other things that happen, some of which w w d c related, some of              |
| 01:06:09   | which not. Uh, the first one I want to talk about are the improvements to home kits. Um,                  |
| 01:06:14   | that have come with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, um, the new HomePod betas and tvOS betas. Um, because,         |
| 01:06:22   | um, home kit has, I mean, it's just had some general improvements, things like, uh, automations           |
| 01:06:27   | converted to shortcuts can wait for like 20 minutes apparently without timing out. Um,                    |
| 01:06:33   | but also, and the thing that is really exciting for me is there are logs for things like locks.           |
| 01:06:40   | Now there are not logs for everything, but if a lock is open, you can see who opened it.                  |
| 01:06:45   | And you can see a history of something like a lock to know who's been opening it and closing              |
| 01:06:50   | it and things like that. And I think that this is really great, especially for those                      |
| 01:06:55   | security related automations. Sadly, it's only for a limited subset of devices,                           |
| 01:07:00   | but I feel like this is a great start for improving home kit for a lot of people.                         |
| 01:07:04   | Agreed. Um, but it wasn't a banner year for [[HomeKit]]. You know, we didn't get a lot of,                   |
| 01:07:09   | of new stuff, but that, that is one of the things we got and that's cool. Um, I feel like                 |
| 01:07:16   | as [[Matter]] sinks in, I feel like [[HomeKit]] is going to evolve more probably in future years.                |
| 01:07:21   | I also think a lot of people at Apple are really busy working on a thing that you strap to your           |
| 01:07:25   | head so they don't have a lot of time. Yeah. We already mentioned the, you know, the thing with           |
| 01:07:31   | Apollo and Reddit, which I guess I just want to join the chorus of everybody saying, um, I think          |
| 01:07:37   | it's really unfortunate that Reddit made the decisions it did. And if you're not up to speed on           |
| 01:07:43   | this, Apollo is a beloved app that is the best way to view Reddit threads. The developer is a             |
| 01:07:51   | single developer. I met him last year at [[WWDC]], a very nice, very smart guy. And they just kind of         |
| 01:07:59   | decided to change Reddit, decided to change your business model. Whereas the Apollo developer             |
| 01:08:06   | once again, a guy who lives in an apartment and is trying to, you know, make his way in the world,        |
| 01:08:10   | he would have to pay $20 million a year to Reddit in order to keep his app running. So.                   |
| 01:08:15   | And it's not just that they, they've decided to bring in, um, API charges. Like he was happy              |
| 01:08:21   | to pay for the API to be clear, um, at a reasonable rate. And that's what they said it was going to       |
| 01:08:26   | be. Um, but they said that the API changes were going to come in from the first of July. So the,          |
| 01:08:31   | the way that the, the things were running where it was free would end at the end of June. Um,             |
| 01:08:37   | and that they'd bring that stuff in. And they said this like two, two or so months ago now.               |
| 01:08:42   | Um, and then they have announced the API pricing in [[WWDC]] week pretty much. Yeah.                          |
| 01:08:50   | So he would have less than 30 days to modify the app to match the, a new business model,                  |
| 01:08:58   | uh, test it, add documentation for users as to, Hey, this is now changed. You can use Reddit for          |
| 01:09:05   | like two minutes a day before you have to pay for an extra subscription. Not a great look.                |
| 01:09:10   | Anyway, and things like that. Um, and then, um, also get it through app review.                           |
| 01:09:17   | Um, and this is, this is the other thing is like, it's not just writing the app and writing the           |
| 01:09:21   | documentation and testing everything like app and documentation and getting that all in. Um,              |
| 01:09:27   | it's also having to go through app review, which even though you can request an expedited app review,     |
| 01:09:32   | and I'm sure he would do, can still take a chunk of time just because of all of the other things          |
| 01:09:37   | going on. Plus in case Reddit didn't notice is [[WWDC]], like this is the biggest time of year for            |
| 01:09:43   | the Apple developer community where they have to be like going through looking at all the new             |
| 01:09:47   | stuff that they can add and figuring out what they're going to be able to add for releases in             |
| 01:09:52   | September and so on. Um, so yeah, they, they Reddit massively dropped the ball on that. They              |
| 01:09:58   | also managed to accuse him of, um, trying to blackmail or extort them. I don't know like                  |
| 01:10:05   | how that will go for them, but, um, yeah, uh, essentially, uh, yeah, they seem to not be doing            |
| 01:10:11   | great. So yeah, really sad about that, especially as Craig Federighi called out Apollo twice in           |
| 01:10:16   | the keynote as being a great app that would just like work on the vision pro and you can pull in          |
| 01:10:21   | the Apollo for Reddit, uh, widget on the Mac, um, from your iPhone and stuff like that. And yeah,         |
| 01:10:26   | he called it out and sadly it's going to have to go away because it's just not going to be possible       |
| 01:10:31   | for Christian to bring it over to the new Reddit API. And I did not talk to him at all at [[WWDC]],           |
| 01:10:37   | never saw him, but if I understand it correctly and granted I could be wrong,                             |
| 01:10:43   | that those fees kick in on July 1st. So let's say he tries to do this in Apple                            |
| 01:10:47   | delay and, and with the amount of users he has, it's in the neighbourhood of $2 million a month.           |
| 01:10:54   | Let's say that he, um, well, maybe less, but you know, it's in that ballpark. Let's say Apple delays      |
| 01:10:59   | him two weeks into July. Does he just now incur a million dollars in liability to Reddit? I mean,         |
| 01:11:06   | it's just, I don't, I don't understand it. Um, I have some ideas as a former lawyer of what's             |
| 01:11:12   | going on, but I don't want to speculate. Um, but I suspect this was not aimed at him, but he was,         |
| 01:11:20   | it was aimed at all third party apps. Essentially it's based on their opportunity cost per user,          |
| 01:11:25   | which I feel like they could probably resolve if they just injected ads as posts into the API.            |
| 01:11:32   | And that was, and, and they did it that way. I honestly don't know why they did it or what the            |
| 01:11:36   | deal is, but what I would say is I'm sad because whenever I see an independent developer that             |
| 01:11:41   | works really hard, kind of getting the rug pulled out from underneath them, it's hard. And, but           |
| 01:11:45   | that's also just a warning anytime you build an app platform on somebody else's thing,                    |
| 01:11:51   | they can always do it to you. You know, I mean, which is sad. So I, I don't know that I have              |
| 01:11:57   | anything positive to say about this, except I'm sorry that Apollo isn't there. But I would say            |
| 01:12:02   | is if you are an Apollo subscriber, as I am, as he shuts it down, sometimes Apple goes through            |
| 01:12:07   | a process where they say, well, the developer is stopping the app and we're offering you a refund.        |
| 01:12:12   | I would encourage you and that we, it hasn't got to that point yet, but if it gets to that point,         |
| 01:12:16   | I would encourage you as a listener to decline the refund and at least let him keep the few bucks         |
| 01:12:23   | that you gave him. This was not something that he controlled and, and give him some runway to,            |
| 01:12:30   | to make the next great thing. Cause he's a very smart guy and he will make a great thing,                 |
| 01:12:33   | whatever the next thing he makes is. Yeah. Yeah. Christian mentioned he has been talking to Paul          |
| 01:12:38   | from Tapbots because Tweetbot had to go through the same thing and he's working with Apple. So that         |
| 01:12:43   | that's, that's all going to be sorted out. And yeah, I would say the same thing. If you're looking,       |
| 01:12:48   | if you're a member of the shortcut subreddit and you are looking for a new home, I would                  |
| 01:12:52   | heartily recommend the Automators forum at talk.automators.fm. There is an entire shortcut               |
| 01:12:57   | section. Go wild. We are happy to have you. The shortcut subreddit has also made a discord                |
| 01:13:04   | server, which is linked in the, in the subreddit. So if you're going elsewhere from Reddit,               |
| 01:13:09   | Automatrix forum and the discord are both very happy to have you. So yeah, fingers crossed all            |
| 01:13:15   | of those awesome people like iBanks and PortaTorrents and so on will continue to be around in the         |
| 01:13:21   | community even if they decide to move to other platforms. Yeah. And maybe that's something                |
| 01:13:27   | I'm going to be reconsidering my relationship with Reddit and based on everything that's happened.        |
| 01:13:33   | All right. More positive. [[ChatGPT]] made an app that went out to the iPhone and now I believe               |
| 01:13:41   | it's on the Mac app store as well. But they put shortcut support in just right before we went             |
| 01:13:49   | to press with this episode. So [[ChatGPT]] is not now only an app on your device. And if you're               |
| 01:13:55   | interested in large language models, this is one of the best ones. Now you can incorporate that [[Large Language Model\|LLM]]       |
| 01:14:00   | into a shortcut. I just saw somebody in the Reddit had made one that takes the new weather                |
| 01:14:08   | report and then they have [[ChatGPT]] write it as if it was a newscaster giving you the news report.          |
| 01:14:15   | And then, you know, I guess they've got a speaking action. I haven't read, I mean,                        |
| 01:14:18   | actually looked at the shortcut yet. It just went up. But the, I think there's a lot of fun you           |
| 01:14:23   | could have with [[ChatGPT]] power added to a shortcut. So that is available to you now. Rosanna,              |
| 01:14:30   | I'll cover it more as we get into it deeper. But that's kind of a fun news item and that's                |
| 01:14:34   | something you may want to check out. Yeah. Yeah, it's good that this is an option. It doesn't get         |
| 01:14:39   | rid of [[Federico Viticci]] [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/). Fabulous. He made a shortcut that interacts with [[ChatGPT]]             |
| 01:14:46   | using the API. You know, it doesn't remove the greatness that is that this is a limited subset.           |
| 01:14:54   | For anybody who's thinking, oh, maybe I'll try this now. I would caution you just double check,           |
| 01:14:59   | you know, with the information that you're putting in there to make sure that it is not                   |
| 01:15:03   | something that needs to be kept private. For example, dumping your work data in there is                  |
| 01:15:09   | probably a no, no, we were explicitly told this at the place that I work. You may not have been           |
| 01:15:14   | explicitly told this, but if you doubt, better safe than sorry, and stick with, you know,                 |
| 01:15:19   | your own personal information to dump into there. Yeah, rewriting the weather information to make         |
| 01:15:25   | it funny is a great use of this. Using it to do your work is a really bad idea for multiple               |
| 01:15:31   | reasons. Number one is it is not, you know, it's not an end-to-end encrypted thing where,                 |
| 01:15:37   | you know, your data is protected. In fact, I think I'm counting on Apple to, you know,                    |
| 01:15:43   | at some point put this stuff on chip and give us more power with a privacy angle to it.                   |
| 01:15:48   | The other thing is a lot of times [[ChatGPT]] is as wrong as it could be, you know, I.                       |
| 01:15:54   | Oh, yes. And it's very confidently incorrect. They asked it to do a bio of me and it talked               |
| 01:16:00   | about me being on Mac break weekly, which I have never been, but I was a host according to                |
| 01:16:06   | [[ChatGPT]] of Mac break weekly. I've never even been on the show. So go figure.                             |
| 01:16:10   | There was a story in the U.S. of a lawyer who had [[ChatGPT]] right part of his brief.                       |
| 01:16:17   | And now he is in real hot water because it cited cases saying things they didn't say.                     |
| 01:16:23   | And that was bad, you know. So I think this is real fun stuff to explore and play with.                   |
| 01:16:33   | It comes with the usual asterisks and quite a few of them at that. Last bit I wanted to say               |
| 01:16:39   | now that we've got the initial news out on [[WWDC]] was just curious, Rose,                                   |
| 01:16:43   | what do you think? How is shortcuts doing at this point?                                                  |
| 01:16:46   | I think it is doing a lot better than people might think. You know,                                       |
| 01:16:51   | it didn't get a lot of screen time in the keynote. It got mentioned briefly in a                          |
| 01:16:56   | shortcuts widget for Mac OS, because Mac OS widgets are coming back to the desktop.                       |
| 01:17:01   | Woo hoo. But I saw some tweets from Symbolx on the Apple team. They were saying, you know,                 |
| 01:17:10   | like, the whole new interactive widgets is built around App Intents, which is shortcut stuff.             |
| 01:17:15   | And I feel like, you know, the way that everything in the system is making its way                        |
| 01:17:20   | into shortcuts and shortcuts is making its way into everything in the system and enabling                 |
| 01:17:23   | things like better widgets, because who doesn't want an interactive widget where you can like             |
| 01:17:28   | check off an item at the moment and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], I'm hoping OmniFocus will be able to update to do          |
| 01:17:32   | this as well. So you can check something off without having to open the app. That's amazing.              |
| 01:17:38   | I love it. So I'm really excited that it's doing this and it's getting all of these updates and so        |
| 01:17:45   | on. And I'm really pleased that they are happy to let users do things that could be dangerous.            |
| 01:17:52   | I use air quotes of things like running a shortcut automatically when you connect to Wi-Fi                |
| 01:17:56   | and things like that. They're still not doing it for like geolocation things and so on. And I feel        |
| 01:18:01   | like that's a reasonable limitation. Geolocation can be proxied by using things like for focus modes,     |
| 01:18:07   | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. But, you know, I'm really excited by all of these improvements. And I feel         |
| 01:18:13   | like the Shortcuts team has done a great job. And I am thrilled for them that their stuff is,             |
| 01:18:18   | you know, even if it's not necessarily getting screen time, it is definitely hitting, you know,           |
| 01:18:23   | the points that make Shortcuts users really happy. How do you feel?                                       |
| 01:18:28   | Same. I feel like it's continuing to get better. I'm using it. I was just noticing the other day          |
| 01:18:34   | how many Shortcuts I have moved out of [[Keyboard Maestro]], you know, actions that normally I would          |
| 01:18:39   | automate with more powerful tools and now I'm doing them Shortcuts on my Mac. And I didn't think it       |
| 01:18:45   | was going to land on the Mac that hard for me that it has. And I just feel like the big story             |
| 01:18:51   | today, we talked about it during the show, but, you know, it's faster. It's more stable. It's             |
| 01:18:56   | becoming a real solid app. And that is what I wanted it to be. And I feel like it's getting               |
| 01:19:02   | there. So I'm going to give it a solid marks for this year, although we didn't get a ton of new           |
| 01:19:08   | features in everything. It is quality of life improved. And that's exactly what we're looking             |
| 01:19:13   | for. I'm going to note that the number of new settings actions that have snuck into Shortcuts             |
| 01:19:20   | means that, like, I feel like there's a lot more features in there than, you know, people might           |
| 01:19:25   | give them credit for. And similarly, things like the ability to just run a shortcut straight from         |
| 01:19:31   | an automation trigger. And the fact that UI has been rewritten, I'm pretty certain that they're,          |
| 01:19:35   | like, that's part of the whole big refactoring they've done behind the scenes to improve                  |
| 01:19:40   | the, you know, the speed and everything. Like, yeah, they definitely deserve full marks. I don't          |
| 01:19:46   | know what we're marking them out of, but I'm giving them full marks plus 20%. Because yeah,               |
| 01:19:50   | we didn't get everything we wanted. No, we're never going to get everything we wanted. We                 |
| 01:19:55   | still got great things and they've knocked it out of the park. So congratulations, Shortcuts team.        |
| 01:19:59   | You've done a great job. And also thank you, if this is the case, for getting all those other             |
| 01:20:04   | app teams inside of Apple to, you know, work on, you know, new app intents and shortcuts actions,         |
| 01:20:09   | because that is really cool. And I'm really excited about that.                                           |
| 01:20:13   | You think they have, like, a new version of Sal who just runs around Apple yelling at people to           |
| 01:20:18   | add automation to their apps? I feel like they do.                                                        |
| 01:20:21   | I don't know. I hope they do. I do know that somebody who used to be on the AppleScript team             |
| 01:20:25   | is now on the Shortcuts team. And I actually met this person at an Automatrix [[WWDC]] meetup,                |
| 01:20:34   | the one where I broke my ankle. Didn't know it was broken at the meetup, to be fair.                      |
| 01:20:38   | That's also where I met Christian, the papal developer, and tell the Shortcuts team turned up.            |
| 01:20:43   | And it was lovely to see them. And they were talking to Sal, talking to some of the Apple                 |
| 01:20:46   | script team and just generally nerding out and being awesome people. But yeah, it's really                |
| 01:20:51   | exciting to see, you know, like that that sort of stuff inside of Apple. And I really hope that,          |
| 01:20:56   | you know, the fact that some of these folks have been there for quite a while now, you know,              |
| 01:20:59   | short Apple Shortcuts or workflows, it was a long time ago. And it's just getting better every year.      |
| 01:21:06   | I feel like people inside of Apple are taking note of that. And also, even if they are still kind         |
| 01:21:12   | of going in Shortcuts app nerdy, like the fact that the interactive widgets are app intense,              |
| 01:21:18   | which then work with Shortcuts to an extent. And like the Apple Watch Ultra button,                       |
| 01:21:24   | like that to me is just, yeah, like the icing on the cake of this is, this is here to stay.               |
| 01:21:29   | And it's only going to get better. All right. We are at the Automatrix podcast. You can find              |

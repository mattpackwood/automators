| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Welcome to The Automators, I'm David Sparks and joined by Rosemary Orchard and this is               |
| 00:06      | The Automators where we talk about how to automate your technology to do your work for               |
| 00:11      | you.                                                                                                 |
| 00:12      | Hello Rosemary.                                                                                      |
| 00:13      | Hey David, how are you doing?                                                                        |
| 00:15      | This is very exciting for me.                                                                        |
| 00:17      | This topic was my idea but your expertise.                                                           |
| 00:21      | We're doing a whole show about shortcuts add-on apps.                                                |
| 00:25      | This was a thing as shortcuts started to get some steam where people would make apps that            |
| 00:31      | add additional features to shortcuts and you do that with your apps.                                 |
| 00:35      | You make an app that does whatever and you add shortcuts actions but some smart developers           |
| 00:41      | had the idea of what if I just made an app that added actions even though my app doesn't             |
| 00:46      | really do anything else and it's allowing third party developers to kind of fill in                  |
| 00:53      | the gaps.                                                                                            |
| 00:54      | That's the stuff that shortcuts doesn't do and it seems to me that Apple has a very                  |
| 00:58      | laissez-faire attitude about it.                                                                     |
| 01:00      | They're like letting this stuff in that's adding all sorts of features.                              |
| 01:04      | Yeah, I mean yes and no.                                                                             |
| 01:05      | I remember [[Alex Hay]] who sadly is no longer with us when he submitted [[Nautomate]] to the                 |
| 01:11      | App Store.                                                                                           |
| 01:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:13      | App review rejected it and said we don't think there's a market for this app to which his            |
| 01:18      | response was, well have you looked in my account?                                                    |
| 01:21      | There's [[Toolbox Pro]].                                                                                 |
| 01:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:24      | What's the difference?                                                                               |
| 01:25      | At which point they decided that it was okay and that they would let him at it.                      |
| 01:29      | But yeah, I have definitely heard plenty of stories from app developers of Apple saying              |
| 01:35      | yeah, we don't think that this app will do anything for users, what's the point of this?             |
| 01:41      | But at the same time, you do have great things out there which do just add functionality.            |
| 01:46      | Yeah, and it's like you do get the occasional bozo and app review but I'm talking about              |
| 01:52      | the actual actions.                                                                                  |
| 01:54      | As an example, one of the apps we're going to talk about today Supercharges Reminders                |
| 01:58      | and the Reminders has built-in shortcuts actions but they're kind of crippled in several ways.       |
| 02:05      | Well, maybe I'm over exaggerating.                                                                   |
| 02:07      | They're not as good as they could be whereas [[Toolbox Pro]] has some really good ones that              |
| 02:12      | are better and Apple doesn't seem to mind that.                                                      |
| 02:16      | If you use shortcuts and you run into barriers a lot of times, it's these third-party apps           |
| 02:21      | that help you out and today what we thought we'd do is just kind of survey them, talk                |
| 02:25      | about some of the high points.                                                                       |
| 02:28      | The list just keeps growing as I was talking here, I got thinking, well, we've got to add            |
| 02:32      | [[BetterTouchTool\|BetterTouchTool's]] as well because even though it's actually a third-party app, it is its            |
| 02:37      | own form of additional features.                                                                     |
| 02:40      | So we've got so many here, gang.                                                                     |
| 02:43      | We're going to try and get through as many as we can and talk about them but take notes,             |
| 02:48      | look at the show notes.                                                                              |
| 02:49      | We have links for everything but if you've ever wanted to go a little bit further with               |
| 02:53      | shortcuts, I think these apps can often be the key that gets you there.                              |
| 02:58      | So that's kind of the wind-up for today's show and one of the reasons I say that my                  |
| 03:03      | pal and yours, [[Rosemary Orchard]], is the expert is when [[Alex Hay]] passed, Rose and her gang            |
| 03:11      | took over [[Toolbox Pro]] which is one of the premier apps in this space so Rose definitely              |
| 03:16      | has a dog in the fight.                                                                              |
| 03:17      | I guess we should say that but at the same time, I can think of nobody better to continue            |
| 03:22      | Alex's great work on Toolbox Pro than you, Rose.                                                     |
| 03:26      | Well, thank you, David.                                                                              |
| 03:27      | It is very important to us that we keep Toolbox Pro and Nautomate and Logger running as Alex          |
| 03:33      | would have wanted and also it turned out he had a couple of other apps in there.                     |
| 03:37      | There's Toolbox Pro 2, there's MenuBox and so on and there's some other sneaky shortcut              |
| 03:43      | utility apps that he had that we're hoping to finish, polish off and release and there's             |
| 03:52      | also some which are sort of, you can tell he got started on stuff and had some really                |
| 03:56      | cool ideas and then put it down to work on something else like Nautomate and so we're                 |
| 04:00      | going to see what we can do with those because he contributed a lot to the Shortcuts community       |
| 04:05      | so we want to make sure that we continue that.                                                       |
| 04:08      | Now a little history here when Shortcuts first really got rolling, it was very quick that            |
| 04:16      | some of these apps showed up.                                                                        |
| 04:17      | I think Toolbox Pro, if it wasn't the first, it was one of the very first that showed up             |
| 04:22      | in this weird category of apps that had Shortcuts actions but not much else.                         |
| 04:27      | Do you know if this was the first one of its kind or I just don't know?                              |
| 04:33      | I think it may have been the first of its kind, yeah.                                                |
| 04:36      | I remember it being in beta and trying it out and going, wow, this is amazing, like                  |
| 04:41      | seriously cool.                                                                                      |
| 04:42      | Yeah, me too.                                                                                        |
| 04:43      | I got in that beta and I'm like, yes, this is exactly what we need.                                  |
| 04:47      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 04:48      | Actually, I remember getting in the beta thinking, oh boy, I hope Apple lets this through because    |
| 04:53      | it's too good.                                                                                       |
| 04:54      | Well, that's just it.                                                                                |
| 04:55      | It was just like workflow.                                                                           |
| 04:57      | It was in beta for quite a while and so what are those things of are they going to let               |
| 05:06      | this through or are they not going to let this through and so on and so forth.                       |
| 05:10      | So yeah, it's really good that they did let it through in the end because yeah, it would             |
| 05:16      | be a sad world if we didn't have things like Toolbox Pro because the number of times that            |
| 05:19      | somebody wants to do an action like just today, I had something that I was working on which          |
| 05:24      | we'll talk about a little bit in Automatorss Max because I'm working on OCRing some text.            |
| 05:29      | I need to be able to crop the image manually.                                                        |
| 05:31      | I can't automatically crop the image because I don't know exactly where like the dividing            |
| 05:38      | lines are going to be and shortcuts doesn't have matched this image, at least as far as              |
| 05:43      | I could tell.                                                                                        |
| 05:44      | So being able to crop the image manually, that's something that I was like, cool, Toolbox            |
| 05:47      | Pro because the crop action built into shortcuts does not give you a crop where you can like         |
| 05:53      | drag the handles around to do this and you could say, Rose, why do you do this in photos?            |
| 05:59      | It's like, well, I need to crop the image anywhere between one and five times and it                 |
| 06:03      | needs to be the same image.                                                                          |
| 06:04      | I don't want to futz around with the duplication and then deleting all of them afterwards.           |
| 06:07      | I just want one screenshot to just go from there.                                                    |
| 06:10      | So yeah, this works better for me and it's really nice just to see how many actions                  |
| 06:15      | are there and then also how many other apps have ended up being inspired by this as well             |
| 06:20      | because Toolbox Pro is far from the only app out there that exists to add actions and functionality  |
| 06:25      | to shortcuts.                                                                                        |
| 06:27      | So Snailed It is the company now running Toolbox Pro and that's great.                               |
| 06:32      | One of the questions I have for you as a reporter to an app developer is Toolbox Pro coming          |
| 06:38      | to the Mac.                                                                                          |
| 06:40      | So Toolbox Pro 1 basically can't come to the Mac.                                                    |
| 06:43      | There are so many actions that it just wouldn't be able to support that it would actually            |
| 06:48      | be a disservice to people to bring Toolbox Pro 1 to the Mac.                                         |
| 06:53      | That said, Alex Hay was working on Toolbox Pro 2 and we are picking up where he left                 |
| 06:57      | off.                                                                                                 |
| 06:58      | We've also got a couple of interesting problems that we need to deal with in Toolbox Pro 1           |
| 07:03      | because Apple did not tell us before the apps were transferred that basically the way that           |
| 07:07      | all of your variables and bookmarks are stored.                                                      |
| 07:13      | When we update the app from our developer account, all of those will be reset for people.            |
| 07:17      | So we need to figure out a way to deal with this and hopefully try and help folks recover            |
| 07:22      | that data because if you're using a folder bookmarks or a global variables in Toolbox                |
| 07:27      | Pro, that's going to be a problem if those go away.                                                  |
| 07:30      | So yeah, we need to figure out how to deal with that, but Toolbox Pro 2 hopefully won't              |
| 07:33      | have any of those issues at all and it will also be available on the Mac.                            |
| 07:38      | And as somebody who's been beta testing it, it's good.                                               |
| 07:41      | It's going to solve all of your problems, I think, David.                                            |
| 07:44      | And also because Apple did a little update a little while ago, folks might remember things           |
| 07:49      | like things, the app things specifically, a lot of folks would end up installing the                 |
| 07:55      | iPhone app on the iPad so that they could use the shortcuts actions and just have one                |
| 07:59      | shortcut that ran on both the iPad and the iPhone because they had different shortcuts               |
| 08:04      | actions.                                                                                             |
| 08:05      | Well, Apple solved that and they had a really clever way of doing that so that you can have          |
| 08:09      | two apps like say OmniFocus 3 and OmniFocus 4 or things for iPad, things for iPhone and              |
| 08:15      | they have the same shortcuts actions.                                                                |
| 08:17      | So if you uninstall one of the apps and you install the other, the shortcuts actions will            |
| 08:21      | continue to work.                                                                                    |
| 08:22      | So we're working on making sure that that's going to work for all of the Toolbox Pro 1               |
| 08:26      | actions that are going to be brought over into two.                                                  |
| 08:29      | So if you install two, then fingers crossed, everything will just work.                              |
| 08:34      | That's the hope anyway.                                                                              |
| 08:35      | And when we get to a point you can do a public beta of Toolbox Pro 2, hopefully we can announce      |
| 08:39      | that on the show or the audience.                                                                    |
| 08:41      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 08:42      | We're not sure at all yet when that's going to be because we want to go through this and             |
| 08:46      | make sure that we do it right and we don't like, you know, screw a bunch of stuff up                 |
| 08:49      | for people.                                                                                          |
| 08:50      | But yeah, when we get to that, I will definitely be announcing it here.                              |
| 08:54      | Anyway, we've been talking about the politics of it, we've been talking about what the app           |
| 08:57      | does.                                                                                                |
| 08:58      | So let me describe it as someone who's not making it, but uses it regularly.                         |
| 09:03      | Toolbox Pro to me is the app I always go to when I need something better.                            |
| 09:08      | A good example is I'm doing a lot of stuff lately in the MacSparky Labs about reminders.            |
| 09:13      | You know, reminders just keeps getting so good that a lot of people are saying, I just               |
| 09:17      | want to use that, you know, can you make it work?                                                    |
| 09:20      | And I think a lot of the tricks to making it work are shortcuts because like it doesn't              |
| 09:25      | really have templated projects.                                                                      |
| 09:27      | You can have a templated list, but not really like if you want, for instance, they have              |
| 09:31      | a new feature where you can make a Kanban.                                                           |
| 09:33      | But if you want to make sub tasks under it, there's no way to template that, but you can             |
| 09:38      | by building it out in shortcuts.                                                                     |
| 09:40      | But you find all these limitations in the shortcuts implementation of reminders, and                 |
| 09:45      | it feels like the reminder team has got a lot they're doing, and the shortcuts is just               |
| 09:50      | not getting quite as much attention as it deserves.                                                  |
| 09:53      | Well, Alex and now Rose have this great set of reminders actions in Toolbox Pro that honestly        |
| 10:02      | run circles around the ones that Apple makes.                                                        |
| 10:04      | I mean, like one of the things I can do now is get the UUID, the unique identifier of a              |
| 10:12      | reminder, which means that I can link it somewhere else in a different application.                  |
| 10:17      | And like all this stuff that I just don't know that Apple will ever do, but even the                 |
| 10:22      | create reminder tasks they have there is better than the Apple one.                                  |
| 10:27      | It does, you know, it gives you more options.                                                        |
| 10:29      | Some of this stuff on the Apple thing just doesn't work where this one is fully baked.               |
| 10:34      | And this is just one example.                                                                        |
| 10:36      | I mean, Toolbox Pro is not just a reminder's alternative.                                            |
| 10:41      | I mean, they've got stuff on images, dictionaries, calendar entries, contacts, you know, anything    |
| 10:47      | you want to automate.                                                                                |
| 10:48      | The list of actions they have for audio is really impressive.                                        |
| 10:51      | I think it's about 15 or 20 different things you can do.                                             |
| 10:54      | And all of these are bits that just go a little further than what Apple's given you and sometimes    |
| 11:00      | quite a bit further.                                                                                 |
| 11:01      | So it is, you know, the app is appropriately named, you know, Toolbox Pro is just what               |
| 11:07      | it sounds like.                                                                                      |
| 11:08      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 11:09      | Well, that was the aim around it and, you know, originally reminders didn't have the                 |
| 11:12      | ability to do things like edit a reminder.                                                           |
| 11:15      | You can edit a contact in shortcuts or a calendar event.                                             |
| 11:19      | So the way that people will work around it is they create a new calendar event and delete            |
| 11:22      | the old one.                                                                                         |
| 11:24      | But that only worked if you could add everything that was on the original and something like         |
| 11:27      | an exchange calendar, like especially something that was maybe like a meeting invite that            |
| 11:33      | involved other people in a meeting room.                                                             |
| 11:35      | That didn't always work right.                                                                       |
| 11:37      | Like that had a huge amount of potential to go wrong.                                                |
| 11:39      | I remember testing doing that at some point and discovering that it unbooked my meeting              |
| 11:44      | room for me on something.                                                                            |
| 11:46      | Now fortunately, because I was aware that I was testing it and the things could go wrong,            |
| 11:51      | like I was watching it like a hawk and immediately rebook my meeting room manually so that nobody    |
| 11:55      | else took it because otherwise I was not going to get a meeting room for like a year and             |
| 11:58      | a half at that point.                                                                                |
| 12:00      | So yeah, I should probably have picked a different event to test it with in hindsight, but you       |
| 12:03      | know, whatever.                                                                                      |
| 12:05      | So yeah, being able to do things like that, and I fully believe that Alex Hay in particular          |
| 12:10      | was one of the people that helped push the number of actions that we get in shortcuts                |
| 12:18      | now from all of these apps because if Toolbox Pro hadn't been there with people using these          |
| 12:23      | things, then I don't think Apple would have gone, huh, maybe we should just have shortcuts           |
| 12:31      | actions in everything.                                                                               |
| 12:33      | And I wish the Reminders team had a bit more capacity so that every time they add a new              |
| 12:38      | feature, somebody also had a story.                                                                  |
| 12:41      | This is usually what you call it when you're developing stories, which have got tasks inside         |
| 12:46      | of them.                                                                                             |
| 12:47      | And then there are also bugs potentially related to a story, potentially just related to existence   |
| 12:52      | in life, and you have to fix the bugs and write stories or solve the stories.                        |
| 12:57      | But yeah, so I wish that they would have a story for every new feature that was added                |
| 13:03      | to Reminders and Safari and Notes and things like that.                                              |
| 13:06      | The Notes team have done an incredible job this year.                                                |
| 13:08      | They're just absolutely nailing it.                                                                  |
| 13:10      | I love that.                                                                                         |
| 13:11      | But yeah, as it is Reminders and Safari in particular, lacking a bit behind, which is                |
| 13:17      | a real shame.                                                                                        |
| 13:18      | Yeah, but I remember talking to Alex about this and him telling me that he wanted to                 |
| 13:23      | be Sherlocked.                                                                                       |
| 13:24      | Like he's like, I celebrate when Apple Sherlocks me, meaning there's some action he developed        |
| 13:29      | for Toolbox Pro and someone in Apple saw it and said that's a good idea and they added               |
| 13:33      | it to the native stuff.                                                                              |
| 13:35      | And then he pulls it out of his app and he is constantly or was constantly finding new               |
| 13:41      | stuff that hopefully Apple would Sherlock again in the future.                                       |
| 13:44      | I'm sure your team kind of has the same feeling about it.                                            |
| 13:46      | Yeah, definitely.                                                                                    |
| 13:48      | We're currently going through looking at all of the actions there, going, okay, well,                |
| 13:52      | all of these actions waiting in the wings, but literally Toolbox Pro hit the maximum                 |
| 13:56      | number of actions that you can add to shortcuts.                                                     |
| 13:58      | So we can't just add all of the other ones that were sort of waiting in the wings and                |
| 14:03      | noted down his ideas because there's a limit.                                                        |
| 14:06      | Yeah, I forgot about that.                                                                           |
| 14:08      | Yeah, Alex told me the same thing.                                                                   |
| 14:09      | He's like, I can't add anymore because they won't let me.                                            |
| 14:14      | So now I need them to Sherlock me so I can take it off my list and put something new                 |
| 14:18      | in the backend.                                                                                      |
| 14:19      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 14:20      | But I think I suspect things like generate UUID and stuff, they're probably never going              |
| 14:26      | to get Sherlocked, get colours as hex or get colours from this image and things like that.             |
| 14:30      | But getting your connection status and stuff like that, that's been just pulled into your            |
| 14:37      | device, which is now a variable that just constantly exists in shortcuts when you go                 |
| 14:41      | to insert a variable, then your device is just one of those things that's always there,              |
| 14:47      | which is just really nice.                                                                           |
| 14:48      | So yeah, it's good that there is definitely some things that over time we're going to                |
| 14:52      | be able to pull out of this so that people can actually just use the native shortcut                 |
| 14:59      | sections.                                                                                            |
| 15:00      | Okay, we have a long list.                                                                           |
| 15:01      | I want to get through more.                                                                          |
| 15:02      | But before we go, so I've told you lately my favourites have been the reminders ones                  |
| 15:07      | because I've been doing a lot of work with them.                                                     |
| 15:08      | But honestly, my favourites in Toolbox Pro just usually whatever I've worked with last.               |
| 15:13      | But what is your favourite set in Toolbox Pro, Rose?                                                  |
| 15:18      | So this is really difficult to pick because there's some things like scan the QR code                |
| 15:25      | in this image or remove emoji from this text or take this thing out of this list, which              |
| 15:31      | is just so difficult to do otherwise.                                                                |
| 15:33      | But my favourite action, honestly, that I probably use the most and it never stays in a shortcut      |
| 15:38      | permanently.                                                                                         |
| 15:40      | Pretty print dictionaries.                                                                           |
| 15:43      | And obviously, there's another app called JSON, which we'll get to in a bit where you                |
| 15:47      | can show the JSON of a dictionary, but pretty print dictionaries is just so useful.                  |
| 15:56      | It's probably a toss up between that one and picking a colour or getting colours from an               |
| 15:59      | image so that I can create a little colour palette for things, but yeah, probably those.              |
| 16:08      | This episode of Automators is brought to you by ExpressVPN.                                          |
| 16:11      | It's so easy now to have multiple streaming services and the cost of them soon adds up.              |
| 16:15      | That's why it can be good to discover ways to make the most out of your existing subscriptions.      |
| 16:20      | Quite often streaming services like Netflix actually have thousands more shows than you              |
| 16:23      | think.                                                                                               |
| 16:24      | You just don't see them all because they give you different shows depending on your country.         |
| 16:27      | So what you see on Netflix here is completely different to what somebody in Italy or South           |
| 16:30      | Korea sees.                                                                                          |
| 16:31      | But using the ExpressVPN app, you can change your online location.                                   |
| 16:35      | ExpressVPN has over 90 countries to choose from, so when you run out of stuff to watch,              |
| 16:39      | you can switch to another country to unlock new shows.                                               |
| 16:42      | Right now, I'm watching Deep Space Nine, that's the Star Trek series, and that's fine, but           |
| 16:47      | I went on holiday and I couldn't keep watching it because it's on Netflix in the UK, but             |
| 16:51      | it's fine because I just ExpressVPN'd back to the UK by tapping one button to change                 |
| 16:55      | my country and refreshing the page.                                                                  |
| 16:58      | A less than $7 a month ExpressVPN pays for itself and so much more.                                  |
| 17:02      | It's a no-brainer, so if you want a way to get more out of your shows and save money                 |
| 17:06      | while you're at it, go to expressvpn.com.                                                            |

| 17:28      | Alex had another project called Nautomate, and I like it because [[Notion]] is a thing for               |
| 17:34      | a lot of people out there.                                                                           |
| 17:35      | If you use [[Notion]], wouldn't it be nice if you could, Shortcuts Automation, but it's                  |
| 17:40      | a web service and it's not really what you would historically think of something you                 |
| 17:45      | would connect to Shortcuts.                                                                          |
| 17:46      | So Alex made a series of Shortcuts to address [[Notion]] that's another one that you are currently       |
| 17:53      | working on, but it's also totally worth mentioning.                                                  |
| 17:58      | As I'm moving my team into [[Notion]], I'm finding that I'm starting to dig into Nautomate, too.         |
| 18:04      | Tell us how it works and what it is.                                                                 |
| 18:06      | Well, I'm just going to start with a little bit of background.                                       |
| 18:10      | I just double-checked just now, and I'll grant that you have the new iPhone 15 Pro Max, and          |
| 18:15      | I only got it a couple of days before recording this, but I've just opened up the [[Notion]] action      |
| 18:19      | section in Shortcuts, and it's got this great message from me, David.                                |
| 18:23      | No actions to show, because [[Notion]] themselves have not supported Shortcuts actions, but              |
| 18:30      | [[Notion]] does have an API, and so what Nautomate does when you launch the app and you go into          |
| 18:38      | the settings, you tap on integrations, and then you add an integration, and it walks                 |
| 18:42      | you through setting it up.                                                                           |
| 18:44      | So you need to get an API key from [[Notion]], and then save your integration.                           |
| 18:51      | And then at that point, you get a whole bunch of Shortcuts actions in Shortcuts from Nautomate,      |
| 18:57      | and they're also listed in the action section inside the Nautomate app.                              |
| 19:01      | But if you're looking for, okay, what can I do with this, then there's also a Shortcuts              |
| 19:06      | section, which gives you some little, you know, there's tutorials, there's some various              |
| 19:11      | examples like an inventory scanner or getting a [[Notion]] ID, but it'll walk you through doing          |
| 19:15      | things like creating a database, creating a page, working with smart blocks to add a                 |
| 19:21      | rich text page to [[Notion]] and stuff.                                                                  |
| 19:23      | So yeah, with Nautomate, the idea is that pretty much anything that you could do with                |
| 19:29      | [[Notion]] via the API should be available inside of Nautomate.                                          |
| 19:36      | And yeah, so it'll get you your databases, get you details of your databases, it'll get              |
| 19:40      | IDs from URL, give you options from various selects that you set up, because the whole               |
| 19:45      | thing with [[Notion]] is it's a personal wiki, but it's not a database in the sense of just              |
| 19:52      | rows and columns, it's also like every record is a page, it can have sub pages and it can            |
| 19:58      | have things that are related to it and images embedded in it and so on.                              |
| 20:01      | So it's not just text, it's way more than text.                                                      |
| 20:05      | So yeah, it's really cool that that's the thing, and I've been working on moving some                |
| 20:09      | of my stuff into [[Notion]] as well, because I'm a diehard Airtable lover, you can pry Airtable          |
| 20:15      | out of my cold dead hands, but especially working on Nautomate, I'm having to get more               |
| 20:22      | familiar with [[Notion]], so I'm moving some stuff in there and I have to say, I'm liking it             |
| 20:27      | for the things that I'm moving in there.                                                             |
| 20:29      | I'm being very careful about what I move over and I'm trying to only move over the things            |
| 20:32      | that I think will benefit, but so far it seems to be working out pretty well for me.                 |
| 20:38      | Yeah, so what I'm doing with it is, I have a small team and we are decided to put some               |
| 20:44      | of the pending projects team-wise into it, but now I still have my personal tools, you               |
| 20:50      | know, OmniFocus, [[Obsidian]], yada yada, and I can automate all of those with shortcuts,                |
| 20:55      | but what I wanted to do was create a record in [[Notion]] when I set up a project for myself             |
| 21:01      | on my local Mac, and that's something that I probably could have done with web calls                 |
| 21:06      | and I could have hacked it together, but it's so much easier with Nautomate, you know, and           |
| 21:12      | then once you create the handshake with Nautomate, there's really a lot you can do.                  |
| 21:18      | I mean, again, you can generate UUID, you can create a database, you can add a block,                |
| 21:22      | but I'm using it in the most basic way.                                                              |
| 21:24      | I just want to add a record to an existing database and that kind of stuff is easy peasy             |
| 21:31      | for this thing, and if you are interested in shortcuts and use [[Notion]], look no further.              |
| 21:36      | I mean, it's an entire app dedicated to it.                                                          |
| 21:39      | There's a related one, too, like if you are a big-time [[Obsidian]] user, there's an app called          |
| 21:48      | Actions for [[Obsidian]], which is kind of the same thing.                                               |
| 21:51      | I mean, [[Obsidian]] is, you know, it's not a native Mac app or iPhone, it's an Electron                 |
| 21:57      | app, so it doesn't necessarily have a lot of tie-ins to shortcuts, but this developer                |
| 22:03      | whose name escapes me, there we go, Carlo Zottman, just made 40 actions that are shortcuts actions    |
| 22:10      | that address your [[Obsidian]] database.                                                                 |
| 22:13      | Very clever and just great idea, and I was on the bait on this one as he was developing              |
| 22:18      | it and just kept getting better with every release, and this is another example like                 |
| 22:22      | Nautomate where you're using an app that historically you would think, well, there's no shortcut     |
| 22:26      | support for this, but then a third-party developer comes in, figures it out, does all the wiring     |
| 22:32      | for you.                                                                                             |
| 22:33      | All you have to do is download and pay a few bucks for their app and you're off to the               |
| 22:36      | races.                                                                                               |
| 22:37      | Yeah, and honestly, that's just one of those great things about these apps where, yes,               |
| 22:45      | you can figure out how to use Obsidian's [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] or how to sync [[Obsidian]] with Dropbox             |
| 22:52      | and then put stuff in there via that, but then you lose some of the niceties that you                |
| 22:57      | get from [[Obsidian]] Sync, or you do what I did for a while, which is set up a double sync,             |
| 23:01      | so syncing via [[Obsidian]] Sync and then one computer is also syncing it to Dropbox so                  |
| 23:04      | that you get the double, but then it just opens up possibilities for something to go                 |
| 23:10      | wrong, and my problem with [[URL Schemes]] is I always think that I remember what they are.              |
| 23:16      | I really, really, really need to learn that my memory is not perfect because every single            |
| 23:20      | time I'm convinced that I know what the [[URL Schemes\|URL scheme]] is, I'll type everything in and click             |
| 23:24      | it or run it, and then something goes wrong somewhere, and so I really should just copy              |
| 23:30      | paste or, in the case of [[Obsidian]], yeah, I'm also using Actions for Obsidian.                        |
| 23:34      | I've given it a good try over the last couple of weeks, and I have to say I'm really liking          |
| 23:37      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 23:38      | Well, and I'm just the opposite of you when it comes to [[URL Schemes]].                                 |
| 23:41      | I have to relearn them every time I implement them because I don't do them frequently.               |
| 23:44      | Well, I also have to relearn them.                                                                   |
| 23:46      | The problem is, is I don't think that I have to relearn them, and that really is the problem.        |
| 23:50      | Yeah, I get it.                                                                                      |
| 23:51      | I get it.                                                                                            |
| 23:52      | But for me, I know I don't know them, but they take time, and when someone makes an                  |
| 23:57      | app that does it for you, I am always on that.                                                       |
| 24:00      | The idea of automation is to save time, and if someone does the heavy lifting for you,               |
| 24:06      | let them do it.                                                                                      |
| 24:07      | You guys are doing it with Nautomate.                                                                |
| 24:11      | Carlos is doing it with Actions for Obsidian, and that's my hope for this episode, is if             |
| 24:15      | you listen, you might want to go download a few of these over the weekend and see how                |
| 24:18      | you can supercharge shortcuts.                                                                       |
| 24:21      | Yeah, and we're going to have links to all of these apps in the show notes, by the way,              |
| 24:24      | and making sure to keep up as we go along so that we have everything in the order that               |
| 24:28      | we've talked about it in as well.                                                                    |
| 24:29      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 24:30      | Give me another one, Rose.                                                                           |
| 24:32      | Well, let's finish covering Alex Hayes' apps that were released at any rate.                         |
| 24:37      | There's also a lovely one called Logger for Shortcuts, and Logger for Shortcuts is logging           |
| 24:44      | inside of Shortcuts, and you can turn your logging on, you can turn your logging off,                |
| 24:48      | you can add tags to logs, you can add contextual data, there's titles and notes and stuff like       |
| 24:54      | that.                                                                                                |
| 24:55      | And basically, the whole point of Logger for Shortcuts is you've got a really long shortcut          |
| 25:00      | that you've been working on, or a series of shortcuts that run in sequence or something,             |
| 25:04      | and you want to be able to double check at times what's going on, how are things working,            |
| 25:09      | or rather, how are things not working, because something somewhere is going a bit wrong and          |
| 25:13      | you don't quite know what or where.                                                                  |
| 25:16      | And that's the point where you can turn to something like Logger for Shortcuts and just              |
| 25:20      | add a series of logging actions, and you can turn logging on, start at the shortcut and              |
| 25:25      | turn it off at the end if you wanted to, or you can just delete the log actions when you're          |
| 25:30      | done, whatever it is that you prefer to do, but then you can have actual logging inside              |
| 25:37      | of your Shortcuts that goes into a separate app, and then you can open it up and search              |
| 25:41      | everything in there and see exactly what's going on.                                                 |
| 25:43      | This can also be very nice if you are running Shortcuts on another device so that you can            |
| 25:47      | see in Logger what happened.                                                                         |
| 25:51      | You can have Logger open, I'll say your Mac, and if you've got maybe an iPad that you have           |
| 25:56      | in front of you, and you're tapping Shortcuts actions on that at various points throughout           |
| 25:59      | your day, kind of using a little bit like a Stream Deck, but it's an iPad with Shortcuts             |
| 26:04      | on it, then if those are logging, then you can actually check in Logger what's going                 |
| 26:09      | on and stuff.                                                                                        |
| 26:10      | So yeah, that's another nice little one.                                                             |
| 26:13      | Yeah, see, I bought this when he released it, and I've only used it a few times, but                 |
| 26:18      | I don't make that many super advanced Shortcuts.                                                     |
| 26:21      | I try to keep them under 15 steps, really.                                                           |
| 26:26      | My feeling is with Shortcuts, the more complexity you add, the system isn't really built for         |
| 26:33      | it.                                                                                                  |
| 26:34      | I know that you and [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] and some folks are getting away with massive Shortcuts, but             |
| 26:38      | this is a tool for that.                                                                             |
| 26:40      | When you start getting longer Shortcuts, I feel like you definitely need something like              |
| 26:43      | this to keep things in check, because Shortcuts behaves funny sometimes when it has too much         |
| 26:49      | to do, and Apple doesn't really give you a debugging tool to find out where the problem              |
| 26:55      | is, and this solves that.                                                                            |
| 26:56      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 26:58      | Honestly, even if you do have shorter actions, say you're doing something that involves talking      |
| 27:05      | to an API and getting some data back, just being able to log the data that you got back              |
| 27:10      | every single time, and if you don't need it, that's fine, but if your Shortcut crashes               |
| 27:15      | shortly after it gets the data back from the URL, and you weren't running it in a mode               |
| 27:20      | where you could see what was going on, then having that logged in logger is really useful            |
| 27:26      | so that then you can go back afterwards and be like, oh, okay, I was expecting an array              |
| 27:32      | with seven items, and I was getting the seventh item from the array, but actually there were         |
| 27:37      | only five items.                                                                                     |
| 27:39      | Maybe I should have been using the get list item in the list instead of getting the specific          |
| 27:44      | number in the list or something like that, so you can figure out what's going wrong through          |
| 27:48      | things like that, because yeah, that's how that works.                                               |
| 27:53      | And there's one more that you were, I believe you developed this app, Focus Cuts.                    |
| 27:58      | Well, I mean, you say I developed it, and you know, the real driving force behind all                |
| 28:03      | the snail development is a lovely guy whose name is also David, there are quite a few                |
| 28:07      | Davids running around in my life, it's very confusing, but yeah, he was the guy who actually        |
| 28:12      | wrote all of the code for this, and I just filed a number of bug reports and did a lot               |
| 28:17      | of parsing of some weird files that are available on your Mac, Focus Cuts is a lovely app on         |
| 28:24      | iPhone and iPad, you can get your current Focus Mode, you can't do it on the Mac, why?               |
| 28:30      | I don't know, but it's just not an action that's available on the Mac.                               |
| 28:33      | I hate that, I hate that, right, so you can just to be clear, on your phone, there's an              |
| 28:38      | action Get Current Focus Mode[^1], and then you get on the Mac and it's not there, I don't know             |
| 28:43      | why, what happened?                                                                                  |
| 28:44      | Did that guy go to lunch that day and just forget, I mean, what happened?                            |
| 28:49      | Yeah, I mean, I feel like they permanently forget about a number of things on macOS or               |
| 28:54      | Mac, they just decide, oh, nobody will want this, and it's like, yep, when you run the               |
| 28:58      | shortcut, it crashes on your Mac, at least give us the option to make it not crash, but              |
| 29:03      | what you can now do, of course, is get your device, if your device is a Mac, use the Focus           |
| 29:08      | Cuts action, because Focus Cuts is only on Mac because it can't work on iOS, but use                 |
| 29:13      | the Focus Cuts action to get your current Focus Mode, and yeah, that will help you out               |
| 29:18      | there, but then we did go a little bit further with it because we thought, you know, there's         |
| 29:23      | some other options here, so if you get the option of getting a list of your Focus Modes,             |
| 29:27      | which is always very nice, and then there's a little menu bar utility where you can have             |
| 29:31      | different shortcuts show up in different Focus Modes, and not only will it show you the icon         |
| 29:36      | of your current Focus Mode, it will also show you the name of the Focus Mode there if you            |
| 29:42      | want it to, it doesn't have to do that, it can just show you the icon, so the idea is                |
| 29:45      | that you can replace the native Focus Mode menu bar, or I've forgotten the name of what              |
| 29:55      | it's actually called, but they're usually referred to as menu bar apps, utility apps.                |
| 29:58      | Up by the clock, you can replace that one with Focus Cuts, and then it will give you                 |
| 30:02      | contextual shortcuts, which is just, I love that, because I have different shortcuts                 |
| 30:07      | show up when I'm in different Focus Modes, and that really does save me quite a bit                  |
| 30:12      | of time every day, because the shortcuts implementation of menu bar apps assumes, first of all, that |
| 30:18      | you only have one Mac, and secondly, that you always want the same shortcuts actions,                |
| 30:23      | neither of which is true in my case, so yeah, it's nice to have the option of doing this             |
| 30:28      | in Focus Cuts where it's deliberately set up per machine.                                            |
| 30:31      | Yeah, and I really believe that that is something Apple will never add, right?                       |
| 30:36      | Even if you buy Focus Cuts and next year Apple adds the check on the Mac to say, well, what          |
| 30:43      | Focus Mode am I in?                                                                                  |
| 30:45      | They show like one piece of it, but the more advanced stuff that you get with these apps,            |
| 30:50      | that stuff is never going away.                                                                      |
| 30:51      | I mean, Apple's never going to make a thing where it's contextual and your menu bar gives            |
| 30:55      | you a list of shortcuts.                                                                             |
| 30:56      | I feel like that's just something they won't do, you know?                                           |
| 31:00      | I mean, that's one of the reasons why we added that feature as well, because we were like,           |
| 31:03      | well, if we get Sherlock next year, we don't want people to feel like they paid a little             |
| 31:07      | bit of money.                                                                                        |
| 31:08      | We're not charging a huge amount for it, but we don't want people to feel like they paid             |
| 31:11      | for something that now they're getting for free.                                                     |
| 31:14      | We want them to still get some value out of this, and so by making it into a menu bar                |
| 31:17      | app, it turned out to solve a whole bunch of problems that I wasn't really aware I was               |
| 31:21      | having until we solved them, at which point it was like, oh, this is actually a really               |
| 31:26      | good idea.                                                                                           |
| 31:27      | I'm very glad we did this.                                                                           |
| 31:28      | Yeah, and honestly, I want an app that is constantly trying to bring me more shortcuts               |
| 31:34      | power with focus modes.                                                                              |
| 31:37      | I would hope that you guys come up with new cool things.                                             |
| 31:41      | As Apple starts to evolve focus modes, maybe there's more stuff you can do, and so I want            |
| 31:47      | to support that, and I want it to continue.                                                          |
| 31:49      | I have a list for you.                                                                               |
| 31:50      | Someday we'll talk.                                                                                  |
| 31:51      | I'm not going to put you on the spot here on microphone, but I have ideas.                           |
| 31:56      | What about Push Cut?                                                                                 |
| 31:58      | This is an app that you've also worked on.                                                           |
| 32:01      | Rose and David and her group of friends gang has kind of absorbed a lot of these types               |
| 32:10      | of apps over time because they're hard to make money on.                                             |
| 32:12      | Can I just say it?                                                                                   |
| 32:14      | A lot of people start them with good intentions, but then they're like, hey, I got to make           |
| 32:18      | a living and this thing isn't doing well.                                                            |
| 32:21      | They've become kind of like the gathering place of those apps, and they're able to bring             |
| 32:25      | on scale and a bunch of smart people, and you should pay them for these apps because                 |
| 32:31      | they do need to make money on them, but they've also figured out a business plan to make this        |
| 32:35      | work.                                                                                                |
| 32:36      | Naturally, a lot of the apps we can talk about today are apps that Rose has an interest in           |
| 32:41      | now, but I don't want to mean that make that the reason we don't talk about it on the show           |
| 32:45      | because these are great apps, but Push Cut is one in general.                                        |
| 32:49      | You were such an advocate of this app, and now you're a developer on it, but I feel like             |
| 32:53      | every time it comes up on automators, I get email from people saying, I just don't understand.       |
| 32:58      | What does Push Cut do?                                                                               |
| 32:59      | Because it's confusing for people like, I'm running a server on an iPad, what's wrong?               |
| 33:04      | Give us the story, Rose.                                                                             |
| 33:06      | Tell us what this app does.                                                                          |
| 33:07      | That's just one of the things that Push Cut does.                                                    |
| 33:09      | Push Cut started out as a way to give you choices.                                                   |
| 33:13      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 33:14      | It's sunset if you're at home.                                                                       |
| 33:16      | Instead of just having your smart home turn on your lights, it can give you an option                |
| 33:22      | of like, hey, do you want Halloween lights, or do you want Cinema Mode at home?                      |
| 33:29      | What do you want?                                                                                    |
| 33:30      | Being able to choose and have it send you a notification.                                            |
| 33:34      | If you tap on the notification, it does whatever your default is, but if you do that little          |
| 33:39      | swipe down when a notification appears at the top where you tap and hold on it on your               |
| 33:42      | lock screen, then it gives you choices.                                                              |
| 33:44      | That's what Pushcut started with.                                                                   |
| 33:47      | And [[Simon Leeb]], the original developer who's still the owner of Push Cut, he expanded it             |
| 33:53      | from there to give you things like background actions.                                               |
| 33:57      | So when I get to this location between these hours, send me a notification so that I can             |
| 34:02      | do things, and he realised that you didn't just have to send a notification, you could               |
| 34:07      | also just do a thing, like get the contents of a URL.                                                |
| 34:11      | And so that became a very useful thing just to start with.                                           |
| 34:18      | And from there, it grew into the option of running your own Push Cut server.                         |
| 34:24      | So Push Cut server could be an iPhone, or it could be an iPad, or there is a beta folks,             |
| 34:29      | and we'll try and put the link to that in the show notes for Push Cut for Mac.                       |
| 34:35      | Now of course, caveat, not everything that runs in shortcuts on iOS and iPad can run                 |
| 34:39      | on the Mac.                                                                                          |
| 34:40      | So you're going to have to be a little careful with your shortcuts, but that's not something         |
| 34:43      | that Push Cut can handle for you, unfortunately, not just yet anyway.                                |
| 34:48      | So there's the option of having a server, which just sits there, and it can listen and               |
| 34:53      | go, hey, is something going to tell me to run a shortcut action here?                                |
| 34:57      | And you can trigger those from shortcuts on another device.                                          |
| 35:00      | You could trigger it by a zap here, if this and that, Mac, formerly Integromat, or through           |
| 35:06      | one of those background location things, or from a notification that you send to yourself.           |
| 35:12      | So you might have a notification that you send to yourself at, say, 10 a.m. every morning,           |
| 35:18      | when you've been at work for an hour and a half that says, hey, get up and stretch.                  |
| 35:22      | And then when you've done getting up and stretching, maybe grabbing some coffee or something, you    |
| 35:28      | tap on the notification, and then it runs off and it goes, okay, let's have a look at                |
| 35:33      | the meetings in the calendar, but it could do all of that on another device.                         |
| 35:37      | So it doesn't have to be running on your iPhone or iPad or whatever it is that you've tapped         |
| 35:42      | on the notification from.                                                                            |
| 35:45      | So that's kind of the original part of Push Cut, so that's already a lot.                            |
| 35:51      | And then widgets came along, and widgets are amazing.                                                |
| 35:55      | Push Cut lets you create custom widgets.                                                             |
| 35:57      | So I have a countdown for the Relay FM event in July next year in London.                            |
| 36:02      | There's a live Relay FM event in London folks next year, and I'm going to be there, and              |
| 36:06      | David's going to be there.                                                                           |
| 36:07      | And I've got a countdown for that on my home screen.                                                 |
| 36:09      | And when I tap that, it will open the Relay FM page for the London event.                            |
| 36:16      | But I created that using Push Cut, because I can have that update every day.                         |
| 36:22      | And we have just added support, and this is very exciting, for multiple actions from                 |
| 36:27      | a widget.                                                                                            |
| 36:28      | So more widgets are still limited to one action, because that's what Apple do.                       |
| 36:32      | But medium-sized widgets and large widgets now have the option of having multiple actions            |
| 36:36      | on them, so that you can have, when I tap on this bit of a widget, run this shortcut.                |
| 36:40      | When I tap on that bit of a widget, open OmniFocus.                                                  |
| 36:43      | When I tap on that bit, run a shortcut that does something using Timery, for example.                |
| 36:49      | And you can have it do all sorts of amazing, cool things with that, because Push Cut kind            |
| 36:55      | of does a heck of a lot, and yeah, it can be a little overwhelming.                                  |
| 37:01      | So I completely understand that.                                                                     |
| 37:02      | We do have a lot of guides on the Push Cut website, which I would recommend that folks               |
| 37:06      | check out for things, but a lot of folks do like to just use it for the widgets or the               |
| 37:13      | background triggers for things as well.                                                              |
| 37:16      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 37:17      | I really recommend going to the website if you're curious about it, and they've got really           |
| 37:22      | good examples there that are really well-documented, but I think the trick is build a couple of      |
| 37:27      | your own, and then you'll get it.                                                                    |
| 37:30      | But even if you don't understand it when you start building it, by the time you finish               |
| 37:34      | it, I think you kind of get it, and then you can go nuts.                                            |
| 37:38      | And I'm really looking forward to the public release of the version that supports Mac 2,             |
| 37:44      | because I kind of want...                                                                            |
| 37:46      | The one thing that held me back with Push Cut is it's always been iOS only, but I feel               |
| 37:50      | like this is such a natural for the Mac, and of my Apple devices, I spend the most time              |
| 37:55      | at the Mac, so I would like to incorporate a bunch of this stuff into my Mac.                        |
| 38:00      | So man, full steam ahead on that, Rose, and keep us posted.                                          |
| 38:04      | As automators, listeners, we have, or I say we, Rose and her team have opened up the public          |
| 38:10      | beta that allows you to use it on the Mac for you.                                                   |
| 38:13      | So we'll put a link for that in the show notes so you can join the beta right now and start          |
| 38:18      | playing with it.                                                                                     |
| 38:19      | It is a great app, and I feel like it never got the support it needed to from the automation         |
| 38:29      | community, because I think it was kind of cryptic.                                                   |
| 38:32      | And one of the things I think you guys are doing really well is kind of making, taking               |
| 38:36      | the mystery out of it and explaining, here's some real world examples of what we can do              |
| 38:40      | with this.                                                                                           |
| 38:41      | Yeah, there's so many cool things that you can do with it, so yeah, it's really good                 |
| 38:46      | that folks are enjoying it.                                                                          |
| 38:50      | And also, we do keep getting future requests from folks, and that is always exciting.                |
| 38:55      | And this is happening across the apps, especially since folks have been learning that we've          |
| 38:58      | taken over Alex Hayes apps, we had a whole flood of requests of, hey, can you have support           |
| 39:03      | for this?                                                                                            |
| 39:04      | Oh, I found this cool thing in [[Notion]].                                                               |
| 39:06      | Can you add a way to do that?                                                                        |
| 39:08      | And so on.                                                                                           |
| 39:09      | And it's taking a while to go through these things, because we don't want to just say,               |
| 39:13      | yeah, we'll do it to everything, which is, you know, because then we end up making promises          |
| 39:18      | that maybe we can't keep, but we are very much hoping that we can, you know, do everything.          |
| 39:26      | We just need to take a little bit of time before we do that.                                         |

| 39:45      | When you work on a small team, every moment counts, you don't want to be wasting your                |
| 39:49      | time finding video conferencing details to send to a new client, and you don't want to               |
| 39:53      | track down the same FAQs from the company website every time there's a question.                     |
| 39:59      | These are the kinds of things you want at your fingertips, so you can get your work done             |
| 40:02      | faster, and that's why you need TextExpander.                                                        |
| 40:05      | With TextExpander, you can type what you access the most with just a few keystrokes, allowing        |
| 40:10      | you to work faster and eliminate repetition, letting you focus on what matters most to               |
| 40:15      | you.                                                                                                 |
| 40:16      | TextExpander's powerful shortcuts and abbreviations streamline your team's work.                     |
| 40:20      | All you have to do is type a short abbreviation and TextExpander does the rest for you.              |
| 40:25      | You just build and collect your most commonly used phrases, messages, URLs, and more right           |
| 40:30      | within TextExpander, then create your chosen abbreviation, and they'll be with you wherever          |
| 40:35      | you type.                                                                                            |
| 40:36      | You can even customise the snippets by having them automatically add in dates, fill in the           |
| 40:41      | blank fields, timestamps, and more.                                                                  |
| 40:43      | This will make sure that you still keep the personality and communications you send, and             |
| 40:47      | you can share all that with your team.                                                               |
| 40:49      | TextExpander is available on any device you use across any app you use, on Mac, Windows,             |

| 40:57      | I use TextExpander repeatedly and often, there are people on Team MacSparky that have access        |
| 41:02      | to my TextExpander, and I also use it personally all the time.                                       |
| 41:07      | It saves me days every year in productivity.                                                         |
| 41:10      | They even send you a report showing you how much time you save.                                      |
| 41:13      | And if you're an automator, this is right in your wheelhouse.                                        |

| 41:41      | And our thanks to TextExpander for their support of the Automators podcast.                          |
| 41:46      | Well, there are so many.                                                                             |
| 41:49      | Let's continue, though.                                                                              |
| 41:51      | Can I pick one of my very favourites?                                                                 |
| 41:55      | This one gets the Velvet Jacket Award on the Automators podcast, Data Jar.                            |
| 42:01      | Data Jar just solves so many little problems for me.                                                  |
| 42:05      | The thing is that Shortcuts doesn't have global variables, and Data Jar, it becomes a source          |
| 42:11      | of global variables in Shortcuts, and [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]] has been a guest on the show.                            |
| 42:16      | He's just one of my favourite developers.                                                             |
| 42:19      | He's just such a cool guy.                                                                           |
| 42:21      | Every time I talk to [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]], I feel like I just want to hang out with him.                            |
| 42:25      | Can I say that?                                                                                      |
| 42:26      | I have a little bit of a crush on him, I think, just like a nerd developer type crush.               |
| 42:32      | Don't get weird.                                                                                     |
| 42:33      | Yeah, but he's cool.                                                                                 |
| 42:36      | So he came up with this idea of global variables.                                                    |
| 42:38      | So the idea of it is I've got a bunch of them populated with my phone number and my address          |
| 42:42      | and different things.                                                                                |
| 42:43      | And when I want a shortcut to call that stuff, I can do that.                                        |
| 42:48      | But if it changes, then I can just go change the global variable, and it updates automatically       |
| 42:52      | in all my Shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 42:53      | It's such an easy little problem to solve that Apple, I don't think, will ever address,              |
| 43:01      | and Data Jar, man.                                                                                    |
| 43:03      | Go check it out.                                                                                     |
| 43:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 43:05      | I don't know what else to say about it, except you need global variables, and there it is.           |
| 43:10      | It's not just global variables, though.                                                              |
| 43:12      | It can be a way to store data.                                                                       |
| 43:15      | Maybe Logger for Shortcuts sounds like it's overkill for you, and you just want a list               |
| 43:18      | of timestamps that something happened at.                                                            |
| 43:21      | Well, you could use Data Jar for that.                                                                |
| 43:23      | And what I really love about Data Jar as well is you go into the app, it's visually pretty.           |
| 43:29      | It looks nice, and you can see things, and you can say, hey, okay, so I'm going to add               |
| 43:34      | some data.                                                                                           |
| 43:35      | You don't have to open the app to use it at all, to be clear.                                        |
| 43:38      | You can just do everything in Shortcuts.                                                             |
| 43:39      | You can't go into the app and manually add data and modify data and change something from            |
| 43:44      | being a number to being a Boolean, for example, and stuff like that.                                 |
| 43:48      | So yeah, it's just really nice to use.                                                               |
| 43:51      | And I'm using the rainbow icons, David.                                                              |
| 43:54      | I'm not sure what icons you're using, but I love them because they're just so colourful,              |
| 43:58      | and my mind can associate the different colours with the different types of data.                     |
| 44:03      | So a little bonus tip for folks there.                                                               |
| 44:06      | I'm just looking at mine right now.                                                                  |
| 44:08      | I have my, in the United States, you have a tax form called a W9.                                    |
| 44:13      | And when people pay you they need it, I saved it as a Data Jar entry, just the PDF of it.            |
| 44:21      | So I can just drop it in into a shortcut when people want it.                                        |
| 44:25      | I've got all, I don't know why, I have one here called the best number, and it says seven            |
| 44:30      | under it.                                                                                            |
| 44:32      | Everybody knows the best number is 42.                                                               |
| 44:35      | What did I do there, Rose?                                                                           |
| 44:36      | I don't know what happened.                                                                          |
| 44:37      | I don't know what you did there, David.                                                              |
| 44:38      | But it's really fun, and the other thing I forgot to mention is, in addition to global               |
| 44:45      | variables that can remember and use repeatedly, it's also just a way to remember something           |
| 44:50      | for a shortcut for later, because shortcut, this memory only lasts as long as the shortcut           |
| 44:55      | runs, right?                                                                                         |
| 44:56      | So if you want to work on something and then come back and run the shortcut again later,             |
| 45:01      | it's going to start from one again.                                                                  |
| 45:03      | It's not going to know.                                                                              |
| 45:04      | And where you store it in Data Jar, you just call it up and there it is.                             |
| 45:08      | It solves a bunch of little problems.                                                                |
| 45:10      | I love it.                                                                                           |
| 45:11      | I don't think he even charges for it.                                                                |
| 45:12      | I made a donation to him at some point, but, yeah, honestly, he should charge for this               |
| 45:18      | thing.                                                                                               |
| 45:19      | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                          |
| 45:20      | [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]] is extremely generous with his apps and time.                                                  |
| 45:23      | I believe Data Jar is free to download, as is another one of his apps, which you'll get              |
| 45:29      | to in just a moment, right?                                                                          |
| 45:31      | So Data Jar is free to download, but then there's optional in app tips that you can give             |
| 45:36      | him.                                                                                                 |
| 45:37      | So, yeah, one thing I'm going to mention that I do with Data Jar, and I'm aware this is              |
| 45:41      | not security best practice, but, oh my God, did this save my bacon relatively recently?              |
| 45:47      | Airtable updated API keys.                                                                           |
| 45:50      | So previously you had like one Airtable API key, and that was it.                                    |
| 45:54      | They have updated from that so that you can now have multiple different tokens and the               |
| 46:00      | way that you generate them and the way that they work is ever so slightly different.                 |
| 46:04      | Now, for most of us as users who are using Airtable actions via like your get contents               |
| 46:10      | of URL and shortcuts, this didn't really make a difference.                                          |
| 46:15      | We just needed to update the token.                                                                  |
| 46:18      | I have a lot, and I mean a lot of shortcuts that use Airtable.                                       |
| 46:24      | Yeah, I bet you do.                                                                                  |
| 46:27      | Fortunately, past me decided I was going to put my API keys in Data Jar.                             |
| 46:32      | All right, so before you go any further, just tell people why that can be a bad idea.                |
| 46:37      | Well, it's a bad idea because Data Jar is not a password manager, okay?                              |
| 46:41      | It doesn't have any kind of authentication, so it's not going to like face ID you when               |
| 46:45      | you log in and stuff.                                                                                |
| 46:47      | That said, it's using, I believe, CloudKit.                                                          |
| 46:50      | Certainly it's syncing your data via Apple's iCloud and stuff, so that's all linked to               |
| 46:54      | your Apple ID.                                                                                       |
| 46:55      | It's not like somebody can just log in on the internet and find all this data.                         |
| 46:58      | So it's not the best idea, it's not the worst idea in the world.                                     |
| 47:03      | It's better than like skywriting your API key on a daily basis for sure, but yeah, technically,      |
| 47:09      | if you wouldn't put your password in it, you probably shouldn't put an API key in it.                |
| 47:13      | So yeah, technically, maybe not the best idea to save my bacon so much because I just had            |
| 47:19      | to update one thing for all of my Airtable shortcuts and then everything just worked.                |
| 47:24      | If it was my bank account password, I would not do that, but for an API key, for a service           |
| 47:32      | that I don't have any secret data on, we all got to choose our own poison, but I know we're          |
| 47:37      | going to get blowback.                                                                               |
| 47:38      | We're talking about this.                                                                            |
| 47:39      | So just be warned, it's not 1Password, right?                                                     |
| 47:43      | You don't use it for that kind of stuff, but yeah, for things you're calling repeatedly              |
| 47:47      | in shortcuts like an API key, it really does save your bacon.                                        |
| 47:51      | Yeah, yeah, and also, this is just, this is really good because this is something I recommended      |
| 47:57      | to [[Matthew Cassinelli]] a while ago and it was very useful for him because he accidentally             |
| 48:02      | exposed his Airtable API key and a couple of other API keys on some live streams at some             |
| 48:08      | point when demoing some shortcuts and had to like reset all of them because they were                |
| 48:12      | just in text in the shortcut, which means that if you're just looking at the shortcut,               |
| 48:16      | if you just sent your shortcut to a friend, they're not going to get like your API key               |
| 48:19      | and stuff like that.                                                                                 |
| 48:22      | And even when I do like the asking people for questions in a shortcut, import questions              |
| 48:29      | in shortcuts, I'll always duplicate the shortcut beforehand if there's personal data in there        |
| 48:33      | that I don't want shared and then like delete it or change it in the duplicated version              |
| 48:38      | that's the one I'm going to share before I do the import questions just because I want               |
| 48:42      | to be really paranoid that there's nothing that's going to get shared accidentally, but              |
| 48:46      | by using a Data Jar to get all of my API keys, I don't ever have to worry about them being           |
| 48:52      | leaked by accident inside of a shortcut.                                                             |
| 48:55      | Yeah, nice.                                                                                          |
| 48:57      | What's next?                                                                                         |
| 48:58      | Well, the next one I wanted to mention, David, is another app from [[Simon Støvring\|Simon]].                            |
| 49:02      | We should probably mention Scriptable, but it's so much more than a Shortcuts utility                |
| 49:06      | app that it kind of doesn't belong here because it does a lot more, but Jayson, Jayson on the            |
| 49:11      | other hand, J-A-Y-S-O-N, is a great app and it's a utility app.                                      |
| 49:16      | It doesn't exist purely to add utility to shortcuts, but oh my gosh, is it useful?                   |
| 49:21      | Like you get something, you get some JSON back, J-S-O-N, JavaScript object notation, back            |
| 49:27      | from an API, for example, or you've got a dictionary in Shortcuts.                                   |
| 49:30      | You can open it in JSON and you can see it.                                                          |
| 49:33      | And this is so great on the iPad where you can like split screen between JSON and Shortcuts          |
| 49:37      | so that as you're writing your shortcut, you can navigate down in JSON and copy like the             |
| 49:43      | key that you need to get something back in Shortcuts, it's such a useful app.                        |
| 49:48      | I really love it.                                                                                    |
| 49:50      | Agreed, agreed.                                                                                      |
| 49:52      | And that one, you can go pretty deep, right?                                                         |
| 49:54      | Like you can do a lot, it can solve a lot of problems for you.                                       |
| 49:58      | There's so many rows.                                                                                |
| 49:59      | I don't even know, can we talk about [[Charty]] for a minute?                                           |
| 50:03      | Yeah, sure.                                                                                          |
| 50:04      | It's a quick, simple one, but you want to make charts with shortcuts.                                |
| 50:08      | It's like, I'm just imagining a meeting at Apple, right?                                             |
| 50:12      | Someone walks in a room and they're looking at all the things they need to work on, right?           |
| 50:16      | And somebody says to Federighi, hey, I'd like to spend the next three months making a bunch          |
| 50:22      | of cool actions in Shortcuts where people can make really impressive charts with no work.            |
| 50:29      | And he would look at them like, you're fired.                                                        |
| 50:31      | We have so much work to do.                                                                          |
| 50:33      | We can't goof around with charts forever, right?                                                     |
| 50:36      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 50:37      | But no, that happened.                                                                               |
| 50:39      | Yeah, it did happen.                                                                                 |
| 50:40      | And not only did it happen, but those charts can also be widgets because he doesn't love             |
| 50:46      | a nice widget on their home screen, and especially if some data that you've been working on.         |
| 50:53      | So it could be a chart of your tooth brushing data, for example, out of health care if you           |
| 50:59      | want it, stuff like that, that's just really cool that you can make that.                            |
| 51:05      | You can literally make charts out of anything that you like.                                         |
| 51:08      | If you've got a set of data, there's a whole bunch of charts in there.                               |
| 51:13      | Whatever you want to do pretty much, you can do it.                                                  |
| 51:17      | So yeah, I would recommend that if you potentially want to make something pretty out of some numeric |
| 51:24      | data, look at Charty because Charty is great.                                                      |
| 51:29      | And if you're collecting a bunch of data and Data Jar and you want to put it on a chart,             |
| 51:33      | you could do that.                                                                                   |
| 51:35      | And this is another app that's kind of weird, right, that somebody would think to do this.           |
| 51:40      | But then the developer did a great job of tutorials, walkthroughs, examples.                         |
| 51:46      | So we don't have time on the show today with all these apps.                                         |
| 51:50      | But if you get this app and you want to make nice charts, you'll be surprised how quickly            |
| 51:54      | you're doing it.                                                                                     |
| 51:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 51:56      | And, you know, when I said earlier, these aren't really apps that do other things.                   |
| 52:02      | The best versions of these apps all do have apps, right?                                             |
| 52:06      | When you open them, they give you a list of what it does and examples.                               |
| 52:10      | And that's been true for every app we've talked about so far.                                        |
| 52:13      | And I guess I should have been saying that because they don't just leave you in the lurch.           |
| 52:17      | You download the app, you open the app, and it gives you samples and examples and screenshots.       |
| 52:22      | So it really gives you all the tools you need to kind of get these things working for you.           |
| 52:26      | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 52:27      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 52:29      | So another app that I want to mention, David, just because it's an app that's been around            |
| 52:36      | for a little while now, and it was written by some friends of mine, actually, Elsewhen.             |
| 52:43      | So if anybody has ever seen a tweet, as he used to post, and any social media post by                |
| 52:52      | [[Myke Hurley]], who's advertising his Friday keyboard club, you might have noticed that                 |
| 52:56      | what he does, he posts flags and then times next to them.                                            |
| 53:02      | And this is the time that he's going to be doing a live stream.                                      |
| 53:05      | And this is something that lots of folks who post live streams do, you know, like they               |
| 53:08      | post a flag that's identifiable, so, you know, Mike would often use Italy for the European           |
| 53:13      | time zones, because, you know, Italy's where [[Federico Viticci]] is and, you know, the UK for,            |
| 53:19      | you know, the GMT or BST as it is right now and things like that.                                    |
| 53:25      | But creating this list can be a bit of a pain.                                                       |
| 53:29      | So Elsewhen decided that it was going to add this.                                                  |
| 53:33      | And elsewhere originally was created to basically be able to select a time and then copy it          |
| 53:38      | and copy a magic Discord code that when you paste that in, it will show, like, the right             |
| 53:44      | thing for everybody who's looking at it regardless of their time zone.                               |
| 53:48      | So if I wrote, say, for example, 1954 into Discord, if I just write it as text, then                 |
| 53:55      | David will just see 1954, right?                                                                     |
| 53:58      | But if I used a Discord code for that and pasted it into Discord, David would actually               |
| 54:03      | see 1154, which is the time right now in California, like, you know, translated.                     |
| 54:09      | And so, yeah, this and it has some shortcut actions.                                                 |
| 54:12      | So if you are, you know, setting up that you're planning on doing a live stream or something         |
| 54:16      | is going to be posted or released at a particular time, and you want to be able to just like         |
| 54:20      | copy a list of time zones, like the same time across different time zones nicely formatted           |
| 54:26      | already, or possibly a Discord code, else one can do it and it's free.                               |
| 54:31      | You know, this app has come a long way since the last time I looked at it.                           |
| 54:36      | I just download it because, like, for the stuff I do in the labs and then the Max Sparking           |
| 54:40      | Field Guides, we do these webinars for the Plus Edition.                                              |
| 54:43      | I've been doing this manually and I'm like, what, what, what am I doing about this app               |
| 54:47      | before?                                                                                              |
| 54:48      | I know I looked at it, it really wasn't quite there.                                                 |
| 54:52      | And now, wow, it has come so far.                                                                    |
| 54:55      | And it's on the Mac too.                                                                             |
| 54:56      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 54:57      | I'm in.                                                                                              |
| 54:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 54:59      | It's a bonus for folks because I have to mention this.                                               |
| 55:04      | The Time list, as it's called in the app, in the code, it's called Myke-mode, as in [[Myke Hurley]]           |
| 55:10      | mode.                                                                                                |
| 55:11      | I just love that that is a thing.                                                                    |
| 55:13      | With a Y.                                                                                            |
| 55:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:15      | Excellent.                                                                                           |
| 55:16      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 55:17      | Well, let's see.                                                                                     |
| 55:18      | You got me on one, Rose.                                                                             |
| 55:19      | I thought I had these down.                                                                          |
| 55:20      | And it's a free app as well.                                                                         |
| 55:22      | So, you know, even if you have colleagues and there's just like one more time zone involved,         |
| 55:27      | like being able to like constantly like just hit like a copy button for like a meeting               |
| 55:31      | time, like select an event from a list of things that it picks out of your calendar                  |
| 55:34      | and then like copy the start time so that you can like send people a reminder that this              |
| 55:39      | is at blah, blah, blah, this time, like being able to just do that and know that it's going          |
| 55:44      | to be right every time.                                                                              |
| 55:46      | So useful.                                                                                           |
| 55:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 55:48      | But you know, one thing I would say, I feel like overall, these developers are all being             |
| 55:51      | too generous.                                                                                        |
| 55:53      | Like I want more apps like this to exist, the only way that happens, because the people              |
| 55:57      | who are making them are smart people is if they get paid for it, you know, so I really               |
| 56:02      | wish they would all have at least a donate button and, you know, as users, if you can                |
| 56:08      | swing it and one of these apps you find you use a lot, even if they didn't charge you,               |
| 56:13      | find a way to send them some money or something just to, you want to encourage the stuff to          |
| 56:17      | continue.                                                                                            |
| 56:18      | And I feel like sometimes for whatever reason, the automation community.                             |
| 56:23      | A lot of our developer friends are afraid to ask for money or they're just too kind.                 |
| 56:28      | I don't even think that they're afraid.                                                              |
| 56:29      | They're like, oh, I just did that.                                                                   |
| 56:30      | You know, you can use it.                                                                            |
| 56:31      | No, man, we want this stuff.                                                                         |
| 56:33      | Well, in Elsewhen's case, they do specifically say that in lieu of donations or paying for             |
| 56:37      | the app, they would like you to donate money to St Jude's Children's Hospital, which really          |
| 56:41      | has just done another marathon fundraising session for including a 12-hour podcastathon.             |
| 56:48      | Really amazing, huge amount of money raised, but yeah, the lovely developers, as the name            |
| 56:54      | of the Elsewhen folks is, would like you to donate to them instead of sending them money.              |
| 56:58      | So yeah.                                                                                             |
| 57:00      | I would like to nominate to the list [[BetterTouchTool]].                                              |
| 57:03      | So BTT, as I lovingly call it, is an amazing Mac app.                                                |
| 57:10      | And they were very liberal about adding shortcuts to [[BetterTouchTool]] when they added it.           |
| 57:17      | And I feel like maybe because [[BetterTouchTool]] doesn't go through the app store or whatever,        |
| 57:22      | it's like they pulled one off.                                                                       |
| 57:23      | And the shortcuts actions are so powerful.                                                           |
| 57:26      | When I did the shortcuts for Mac Field Guide, I called [[BetterTouchTool]] my secret weapon               |
| 57:30      | because all of the actions that I wanted Apple to do that they didn't do, they added in Better       |
| 57:36      | Touch Tool.                                                                                          |
| 57:37      | Like, you know, push a button in a menu item.                                                        |
| 57:40      | Like, I even asked an Apple person about that when we interviewed them on Mac Power                  |
| 57:43      | Users.                                                                                               |
| 57:44      | They said, oh, I don't think we're going to do something like that.                                  |
| 57:46      | Well, it's in [[BetterTouchTool]] and that and many other things like it.                              |
| 57:50      | So any kind of automation you want to hack together on your Mac with shortcuts.                      |
| 57:55      | So often, [[BetterTouchTool]] is the secret sauce to get you over the finish line.                     |
| 58:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 58:02      | And just like [[Keyboard Maestro]], it's got some of the same actions that [[Keyboard Maestro]]              |
| 58:06      | has.                                                                                                 |
| 58:07      | But in [[Keyboard Maestro]], you'll need to put them into like a whole macro to use them.                |
| 58:11      | Because like finding an image on the screen or clicking at it, like, that's something                |
| 58:15      | that you'll do like inside of [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                      |
| 58:18      | But you can find an image on your screen using [[BetterTouchTool]] and then use like that output       |
| 58:26      | and optionally move your mouse to it and things like that just inside of a shortcut.                 |
| 58:30      | So if you don't need, you know, everything else around it, then you can use that.                    |
| 58:35      | But honestly, it's just so useful.                                                                   |
| 58:38      | Like, there's options for mission control and showing previews and moving and dragging               |
| 58:44      | your mouse.                                                                                          |
| 58:45      | Like just saying, being able to say, like, drag this thing here or saving your current               |
| 58:50      | window layout and stuff.                                                                             |
| 58:51      | I really wish Moom had shortcut sections.                                                            |
| 58:54      | Really need to write to those folks and ask for some shortcut sections because that could            |
| 58:59      | be really useful for me.                                                                             |
| 59:01      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 59:02      | That would easy.                                                                                     |
| 59:03      | I mean, we've got the little hack we do with the AppleScript, right?                                |
| 59:07      | And that's the one...                                                                                |
| 59:08      | Well, yeah, executing Moom is fine.                                                                  |
| 59:09      | It's just creating, like saving a window layout.                                                     |
| 59:12      | That would be very nice to do as part of like a thing because I could imagine like getting           |
| 59:16      | a list of my currently active apps, save into a bunch and creating a Moom snapshot and things        |
| 59:20      | like that.                                                                                           |
| 59:21      | You know, like I could imagine doing that with a shortcut and at the moment, can't quite             |
| 59:27      | do that.                                                                                             |
| 59:28      | So, yeah, I have to figure out.                                                                      |
| 59:29      | Yeah, I like that.                                                                                   |
| 59:30      | So, good one.                                                                                        |
| 59:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 59:32      | What's another one on our list here, Rose?                                                           |
| 59:34      | Well, I've got a couple of nerdy mentions, but I'm going to start with a nice old easy               |
| 59:40      | one.                                                                                                 |
| 59:41      | You're going to...                                                                                   |
| 59:42      | You got a nerdy mention now?                                                                         |
| 59:43      | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 59:44      | Well, I guess it's time for that.                                                                    |
| 59:45      | Well, I mean, I was going to go with a less nerdy mention because have you ever had like,            |
| 59:50      | I don't know, say a link to a Zoom meeting that you use on a regular basis, but you don't            |
| 59:55      | want to open it in your browser and then have it open in the Zoom app.                               |
| 59:59      | You just want to straight up open it in the Zoom app, right?                                         |
| 01:00:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:00:03   | Well, that's what Opener is for.                                                                     |
| 01:00:05   | So, Opener is an app and it basically came into existence for things that didn't properly            |
| 01:00:13   | necessarily open deep links or so that you could work around like, hey, the Twitter links            |
| 01:00:20   | or the Reddit links don't want to open in this app.                                                  |
| 01:00:24   | Obviously, unfortunately, my favourite Reddit client is now dead subtly because Reddit killed         |
| 01:00:29   | Apollo, which is very sad, but Opener was created basically to just let you open apps                |
| 01:00:35   | in open URLs in specific apps and it works in shortcuts.                                             |
| 01:00:41   | So I have a number of shortcuts, which will just like open a Zoom URL in Zoom and things             |
| 01:00:46   | like that.                                                                                           |
| 01:00:47   | And this is just so useful that, yeah, it's really hard to explain in some ways because              |
| 01:00:53   | it just opens a URL, but it doesn't open it in Safari.                                               |
| 01:00:55   | It opens it in the correct app.                                                                      |
| 01:00:58   | And that just makes my day every time because I don't have a bunch of useless Safari Windows         |
| 01:01:02   | hanging around or tabs hanging around later.                                                         |
| 01:01:05   | I think that's easy to understand.                                                                   |
| 01:01:06   | I mean, a lot of apps use URLs as ways to trigger things.                                            |
| 01:01:11   | As automators, it's often for us the shortcut, the easy way to get something to happen, but          |
| 01:01:16   | so often it has to go through Safari first, right?                                                   |
| 01:01:20   | It opens a browser and then goes to the thing and it's just so frustrating.                          |
| 01:01:24   | And this allows you to bypass that.                                                                  |
| 01:01:27   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:01:28   | And they have shortcut support, which is why it's being discussed today.                             |
| 01:01:31   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:01:32   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:01:33   | And it can be useful for all sorts of things like opening Aliexpress apps in the right               |
| 01:01:37   | thing or opening Amazon links in the Amazon app and stuff like that.                                 |
| 01:01:42   | But you can also like specifically open things in third-party browsers and it's got a URL            |
| 01:01:48   | scheme.                                                                                              |
| 01:01:49   | So, and it can also detect Amp links to open them if you wanted to.                                   |
| 01:01:56   | I personally don't like Google Amp links because it kind of breaks the way a whole bunch of           |
| 01:02:00   | websites wanted to do things in the first place and deprive some of revenue.                         |
| 01:02:04   | But like the fact that if you're on a really bad connection, it can do that and load the             |
| 01:02:08   | page that you do desperately need to load because it's got the information about the                 |
| 01:02:12   | restaurant that you're trying to find or something can be very useful.                               |
| 01:02:15   | All right.                                                                                           |
| 01:02:16   | Why don't you pick another one, Rose?                                                                |
| 01:02:19   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:20   | Okay.                                                                                                |
| 01:02:21   | Then I gave folks, everybody kind of gets this one.                                                  |
| 01:02:26   | So the next one I'm going to give folks is one that maybe is not such a wide audience.               |
| 01:02:32   | Secure shellfish.                                                                                    |
| 01:02:33   | Now, Secure ShellFish is far from just a shortcut's utility app to be clear.                         |
| 01:02:37   | It exists to add SFTP servers to the file app.                                                       |
| 01:02:43   | Now some of you might be going, whoa, brain is checking out.                                         |
| 01:02:47   | Basically think of it as a way to log into certain computers and just make sure that                 |
| 01:02:52   | their files are also available in the files app on iOS.                                              |
| 01:02:54   | It's very useful.                                                                                    |
| 01:02:55   | Like, you know, I have my server that my website runs on and I can have that in the files            |
| 01:03:01   | app on iOS because of Secure ShellFish.                                                              |
| 01:03:04   | But what it also has is shortcut actions.                                                            |
| 01:03:08   | And I don't know how many folks have tried this, but when you SSH into something via                 |
| 01:03:13   | shortcuts, there is the option to change from password to SSH key.                                   |
| 01:03:19   | And I can copy a key or I can generate a new key.                                                    |
| 01:03:22   | I don't have the ability to import an SSH key.                                                       |
| 01:03:27   | So if there is a key that I want to reuse, like, for example, adding a new key to that               |
| 01:03:31   | server perhaps is very problematic or something.                                                     |
| 01:03:34   | That is not something I can do.                                                                      |
| 01:03:36   | So I then am stuck with password authentication.                                                     |
| 01:03:39   | If however, I decide that instead of using the run script over SSH action, I would prefer            |
| 01:03:45   | to use Secure ShellFish.                                                                             |
| 01:03:46   | And the SSH keys that I've got in Secure ShellFish will just, you know, work.                        |
| 01:03:53   | So I can, you know, I can start an SSH terminal from there.                                          |
| 01:03:56   | I can get files.                                                                                     |
| 01:03:58   | I can download files from it, create directories, backup things, all sorts of stuff.                 |
| 01:04:02   | So yeah, if you need to work with servers via SSH and SFTP, and you might want to do                 |
| 01:04:09   | it in shortcuts, try checking out Secure ShellFish.                                                  |
| 01:04:13   | I've got another one for you, actions for shortcuts.                                                 |
| 01:04:16   | And this is similar to Toolbox Pro, but it seems like they've kind of given space to                 |
| 01:04:21   | Toolbox Pro and they're just picking actions that are generally not in Toolbox Pro.                  |
| 01:04:27   | So it's just another list of additional actions.                                                     |
| 01:04:31   | They, their Mac app, I believe this is true on iOS too, but their Mac app doesn't give               |
| 01:04:35   | you samples and a listing.                                                                           |
| 01:04:38   | It's very naughty.                                                                                   |
| 01:04:39   | It just says, oh, we added a bunch of shortcuts, go have fun.                                        |
| 01:04:43   | But you know, but at the same time, it does add more stuff, right?                                   |
| 01:04:46   | You want to convert a date to Unix time.                                                             |
| 01:04:48   | You want to ask [[ChatGPT]] and do a check to see if Bluetooth is on.                                   |
| 01:04:54   | They've got just like everything else.                                                               |
| 01:04:55   | They've got a whole bunch of stuff here.                                                             |
| 01:04:57   | Blur images is another one of these that I've used, get SF symbol image.                             |
| 01:05:03   | So they've got some very useful shortcuts actions here and you just add a pile of them               |
| 01:05:08   | to the shortcuts, you know, dictionary.                                                              |
| 01:05:12   | So you download this app and it's again a few bucks.                                                 |
| 01:05:15   | I don't remember how much I paid for it.                                                             |
| 01:05:17   | I bought it years ago, but now I've got a whole bucket of things I can do in shortcuts               |
| 01:05:21   | that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise.                                                             |
| 01:05:23   | And it's another one definitely worth checking out.                                                  |
| 01:05:26   | Yeah, absolutely.                                                                                    |
| 01:05:28   | I've got another really one for folks, sorry folks, but this, this is genuinely a very               |
| 01:05:33   | nice one that you may find very useful.                                                              |
| 01:05:36   | You ever need get contents of URL, but maybe you need the same get contents of your multiple         |
| 01:05:41   | shortcuts or maybe you've got quite a long shortcut and the get contents of URL is like              |
| 01:05:45   | halfway through it and some things changed.                                                          |
| 01:05:49   | And you need to like figure out what you're getting back and what's going on and stuff               |
| 01:05:52   | like that.                                                                                           |
| 01:05:53   | It can be really, really, really difficult to work with.                                             |
| 01:05:56   | And so I found, and I'm pretty certain I found this because the developer was using something,       |
| 01:06:02   | a library that Simon Støvring created as part of one of his apps that he was working                |
| 01:06:09   | on.                                                                                                  |
| 01:06:10   | But this is HTTP bot.                                                                                |
| 01:06:12   | And so the point of this is, if folks have ever heard of, say, a postman or something                |
| 01:06:16   | like that, it's like that.                                                                           |
| 01:06:19   | So you do get contents of URL in an app and you can save requests.                                   |
| 01:06:25   | So every get contents of URL could be a request, which means that you can use the same one           |
| 01:06:30   | across different shortcuts.                                                                          |
| 01:06:31   | If you want to, you don't have to.                                                                   |
| 01:06:33   | You can create lots of new ones and you can favourite things and so on.                               |
| 01:06:39   | But yeah, basically, it just is get contents of URL with extras so that you can manage               |
| 01:06:48   | your authentication and save credentials and stuff and reuse it.                                     |
| 01:06:51   | So if you don't want to be me and have all of your Airtable API keys in shortcuts, you                 |
| 01:06:56   | can just have managed authentication inside of HTTP bot.                                             |
| 01:07:01   | So yeah, get contents of URL, but just a bit nicer and more easy to test and reuse.                  |
| 01:07:07   | Oh, you got me again, Rose.                                                                          |
| 01:07:09   | You got me again.                                                                                    |
| 01:07:11   | I'm sorry, David.                                                                                    |
| 01:07:12   | I'm getting this one.                                                                                |
| 01:07:13   | It's for your own good.                                                                              |
| 01:07:14   | No, it is because for my URL spelunking, I need help and this is just looking at the                 |
| 01:07:20   | screenshot.                                                                                          |
| 01:07:21   | I'm like, yes, this is data I would like on occasion.                                                |
| 01:07:23   | I'm buying this one or downloading it out.                                                           |
| 01:07:27   | Going back to something a little more in the norm, [[Drafts]].                                           |
| 01:07:32   | We can't do a show like this without mentioning [[Drafts]].                                              |
| 01:07:35   | [[Drafts]] has its own shortcuts actions, which is great, but it also does so much more than             |
| 01:07:40   | that with shortcuts.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:07:43   | I mean, one of those things that I do just end up using [[Drafts]] for is, obviously, I add              |
| 01:07:49   | stuff to [[Drafts]].                                                                                     |
| 01:07:50   | That's one of the things that I probably do the most with shortcuts by far.                          |
| 01:07:56   | But something else that you can do with [[Drafts]], like there are so many things that you can           |
| 01:08:00   | do with [[Drafts]] where it doesn't even need to use the [[Drafts]] app.                                     |
| 01:08:06   | For example, there's utilities like Markdown, HTML, and HTML to Markdown.                            |
| 01:08:11   | You might think, huh, don't those kind of exist in shortcuts?                                        |
| 01:08:14   | Only if you convert it to rich text first, which doesn't always work perfectly.                      |
| 01:08:19   | There's a utility for arranging text and so on.                                                      |
| 01:08:25   | You can also run [[Drafts]] actions on text.                                                             |
| 01:08:29   | There's the option to run a draft section on a draft, but you can also just straight                 |
| 01:08:33   | up run it on text without a draft existing.                                                          |
| 01:08:37   | You don't actually have to create and then delete a draft if you don't want to.                      |
| 01:08:39   | You can just use [[Drafts]] to run the magic that is in a draft section on something else.               |
| 01:08:47   | I really, really like this as just a utility app, as well as an app that I use all the               |
| 01:08:55   | time.                                                                                                |
| 01:08:56   | Yeah, it's just like another example of an app that just develop, they give so much to               |
| 01:09:02   | shortcuts in terms of actions that you find yourself using even when you don't think you're          |
| 01:09:06   | using the [[Drafts]] app.                                                                                |
| 01:09:09   | [[Drafts]] is still a piece of the shortcut recipe that makes something automate for you.                |
| 01:09:17   | Another one I'm going to mention, don't worry, David, I'm going less nerdy now, a little             |
| 01:09:21   | bit less nerdy.                                                                                      |
| 01:09:22   | I know folks like shortcuts automations, and Mac OS is a little problematic when it comes            |
| 01:09:28   | to shortcuts automations, unless you've got Shortery, because Shortery, shortcuts automations        |
| 01:09:33   | for the Mac.                                                                                         |
| 01:09:36   | That's my whole pitch.                                                                               |
| 01:09:37   | I think that basically just sells it for most folks right there because it's shortcuts               |
| 01:09:43   | automations where most folks, if they're going to run shortcuts automations, probably                |
| 01:09:48   | want them in the first place.                                                                        |
| 01:09:50   | That makes no sense to me that we need this app, but I'm glad we have this app.                      |
| 01:09:56   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:09:57   | Right?                                                                                               |
| 01:09:58   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:09:59   | Why do I need this app?                                                                              |
| 01:10:00   | But also, thank you.                                                                                 |
| 01:10:01   | Thank you to the developer whose name I've forgotten it's now blurred out.                           |
| 01:10:06   | Unit number five, yeah, they're not using their name name, they're using their company               |
| 01:10:12   | name, but yeah, this app is very, very useful, so I highly recommend it.                             |
| 01:10:19   | Why do you think Apple hasn't got to this?                                                           |
| 01:10:22   | I guess the question I should explain for people who aren't aware is, you can add personal           |
| 01:10:27   | automations to shortcuts on your iPhone and on your iPad and do cool stuff, and they have            |
| 01:10:33   | shortcuts on the Mac, but that button isn't there.                                                   |
| 01:10:36   | You can't do it.                                                                                     |
| 01:10:38   | I feel like this is one of those things where part of me thinks that it's something to do            |
| 01:10:45   | with some Apple exec somewhere, was just like, no, that's a step too far, we're not letting          |
| 01:10:49   | these cool kids do what they want, and then response to the shortcuts team.                          |
| 01:10:55   | Another part of me thinks that there was just an argument and they spent six months trying           |
| 01:10:59   | to figure out what triggers they would have and ended up with none of them because they              |
| 01:11:03   | had a list of 7,000 or something like that.                                                          |
| 01:11:07   | So yeah, I don't know why this doesn't exist on natively on macOS.                                   |
| 01:11:14   | I very much hope this app gets sure-locked, not because I want the developer to lose out,            |
| 01:11:19   | but because I feel like, yeah, it would just make a lot of sense if it were sure-locked,             |
| 01:11:26   | but it's currently just not even a thing.                                                            |
| 01:11:29   | Yeah, as an example, in the MacSparky Labs, I had a lab server write-in.                            |
| 01:11:34   | For work, he's got a work app on his iPhone, and they want him to be on a VPN every time             |
| 01:11:40   | he logs in.                                                                                          |
| 01:11:41   | And I'm like, well, if they do it right, you really don't need to be on a VPN, but he's              |
| 01:11:45   | like, yeah, but I need to because that's what work wants.                                            |
| 01:11:47   | So he has to go into the VPN app, he has to turn it on, then he has to go load the app,              |
| 01:11:52   | and then when he's done with the app, he turns the VPN off, and I'm like, well, that's an            |
| 01:11:56   | easy problem on the iPhone.                                                                          |
| 01:11:58   | You use shortcuts, automation, they have an application trigger.                                     |
| 01:12:02   | So when you click on, when you open the work app, have it go to your VPN app of choice,              |
| 01:12:08   | there's an action in shortcuts that says, enable my VPN, I released a video on it to                 |
| 01:12:12   | the lab server, showing them how to do this, and then you can have, when you exit the app,           |
| 01:12:16   | you can have it quit the VPN, all that's easy.                                                       |
| 01:12:18   | That's not possible on the Mac.                                                                      |
| 01:12:20   | He wrote me back afterwards, well, how about the Mac, I'm like, well, you got to buy it.             |
| 01:12:24   | Well, the good news is, is connecting to a VPN on the Mac, if it's using the native Mac              |
| 01:12:28   | OS networking, that is something that is available now in Ventura, at least, so it should also       |
| 01:12:34   | be available in Sonoma, but at the same time, it wasn't there from the beginning, and it's           |
| 01:12:38   | just, yeah, and then there were apps adding their own actions, and then they didn't work             |
| 01:12:42   | on the Mac because they only wrote them for the iOS app and stuff like that, it's a whole,           |
| 01:12:46   | a whole thing.                                                                                       |
| 01:12:47   | So yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:12:48   | But with shorter, you get application triggers, wake up and sleep, the Wi-Fi trigger, I love         |
| 01:12:54   | the Wi-Fi trigger, right, you know what I mean?                                                      |
| 01:12:57   | And so you've got a bunch of these options available to you.                                         |
| 01:13:01   | I like that they've added a sunrise and sunset trigger.                                              |
| 01:13:04   | I'm not sure when I would use that, but it's cool that it exists, right?                             |
| 01:13:09   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:10   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:13:11   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 01:13:12   | Calendar events, that's a good one too, calendar events, yeah, so it's just, yeah.                   |
| 01:13:16   | Something that's not available on iOS.                                                               |
| 01:13:18   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:13:19   | Shorty.                                                                                              |
| 01:13:20   | Well, yeah, that's shorty, shall we have a quick chat about some other useful Mac apps               |
| 01:13:27   | while we're here?                                                                                    |
| 01:13:28   | Because ShareBot and MenuBot kind of have to be mentioned, right, because, like, so                |
| 01:13:34   | Apple kind of fixes in Sonoma with ShareBot, at least where, or maybe it was even Ventura,          |
| 01:13:42   | where apps like Shortcuts are properly in your share sheet on Mac OS, but ShareBot                  |
| 01:13:47   | got there first.                                                                                     |
| 01:13:49   | And so it definitely deserves a mention for that.                                                    |
| 01:13:52   | And if you have any weirdness in Sonoma or you can't update to Sonoma or your work won't             |
| 01:13:56   | let you update to Sonoma just yet or whatever, then you probably want to check out ShareBot         |
| 01:14:00   | so that all of the things that are in your share sheet on iOS, at least in Shortcuts                 |
| 01:14:04   | land, are also there on Mac OS.                                                                      |
| 01:14:08   | So yeah, that's as simple as it gets, it puts Shortcuts back in your share sheet, which              |
| 01:14:15   | is probably what you want.                                                                           |
| 01:14:18   | And the developer actually makes a whole host of little utility apps, including one called           |
| 01:14:23   | MenuBot, which does better Shortcuts menu bar stuff.                                                |
| 01:14:27   | It's not necessarily focus mode, contextual-like focus cuts, but it is better than the native        |
| 01:14:36   | Shortcuts integration.                                                                               |
| 01:14:37   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:14:38   | And I think we can't talk about Jose without talking about HomeBot.                                  |
| 01:14:43   | Oh yeah, HomeBot and QuietMeet have to be like the two bonus recommendations, which                  |
| 01:14:48   | aren't technically Shortcuts apps, but they enable so much other automation that, yeah,              |
| 01:14:54   | it's genuinely.                                                                                      |
| 01:14:56   | It stuns me every single time that I look at, and so this is Pedro Jose Pereira Vieito.               |
| 01:15:03   | I'm really, really sorry if I pronounced your name incorrectly, Pedro, but yeah, he's got            |
| 01:15:09   | so many, so many great apps, yeah, like there's like an extension to be a little sorry for           |
| 01:15:15   | you.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:16   | Make Pass is another one I've used.                                                                  |
| 01:15:17   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:15:18   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:15:19   | So yeah, just like even if you're there going, I'm not sure about this, like, are you ever           |
| 01:15:25   | playing music and you just need it to like auto-pause as you go into a meeting?                      |
| 01:15:30   | QuietMeet.                                                                                           |
| 01:15:31   | It exists.                                                                                           |
| 01:15:32   | It works.                                                                                            |
| 01:15:33   | Like he added support for a couple of other things based on my request, which was so appreciated.    |
| 01:15:38   | Because Teams didn't work really well to start with, and he did a whole bunch of work to             |
| 01:15:42   | make Teams work for me, which I really appreciate.                                                   |
| 01:15:45   | And then work switch to Slack, and now we switch back to Teams, so it works again.                   |
| 01:15:50   | So yeah, I highly recommend it.                                                                      |
| 01:15:52   | HomeBot will let you like create [[URL Schemes]] for HomeKit stuff, so you can use it from               |
| 01:15:57   | your Stream Deck.                                                                                    |
| 01:15:58   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:59   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:16:00   | Just great.                                                                                          |
| 01:16:01   | All right.                                                                                           |
| 01:16:02   | Did we cover them all?                                                                               |
| 01:16:03   | I think there was a couple more.                                                                     |
| 01:16:05   | You said, oh, you know, QuietMeet, we got that one too?                                              |
| 01:16:08   | Well, there we go.                                                                                   |
| 01:16:09   | Yeah, yeah, yeah.                                                                                    |
| 01:16:10   | Wow, that's quite a list.                                                                            |
| 01:16:11   | That's quite a list.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:12   | It is.                                                                                               |
| 01:16:13   | I think there are two other things that I would like to mention.                                     |
| 01:16:16   | If you ever need to download files as part of a shortcut and keep them around for a bit,             |
| 01:16:21   | but you don't want to keep them around forever, you might want to put them into something            |
| 01:16:24   | like a shelf app like [[Yoink]], which is a great shelf app for Mac OS and iOS and iPad OS.              |
| 01:16:32   | And yeah, it will let you stick a file in there.                                                     |
| 01:16:34   | It'll let you get files back using shortcuts, all sorts of things.                                   |
| 01:16:39   | And this is honestly one of those things where I just stick a thing that I know I need to            |
| 01:16:43   | do a thing with, like if I download like a PDF or something, I'll put it there.                      |
| 01:16:48   | And then when I've dealt with it, it'll just go away magically, which is perfect.                    |
| 01:16:52   | You know, I need to spend time with [[Yoink]] because I've been using Drop Zone forever                  |
| 01:16:56   | because I've just got it so automated, like I've got the things where I can move stuff               |
| 01:17:00   | to folders.                                                                                          |
| 01:17:01   | Oh, I use both.                                                                                      |
| 01:17:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:17:03   | I need to find the happy place.                                                                      |
| 01:17:04   | I use [[Yoink]] for action this thing right now, and I use [[Yoink]] for put this thing here while           |
| 01:17:11   | I do some stuff and then I can grab it.                                                              |
| 01:17:13   | And you can grab it with a shortcut, which to me is irresistible, so I'm probably going              |
| 01:17:18   | to have to go back into [[Yoink]].                                                                       |
| 01:17:20   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:17:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:17:22   | And the developer is of [[Yoink]] is great.                                                              |
| 01:17:24   | He's made a whole bunch of useful apps, including some very nerdy developer ones.                    |
| 01:17:30   | Backlog is one of my favourites.                                                                      |
| 01:17:31   | Like whenever something weird happens on my Mac and I have to send a developer a log, but            |
| 01:17:35   | I didn't have the console open, I'm like, backlog.                                                   |
| 01:17:39   | That app will save me every time, so I can send folks some logs.                                     |
| 01:17:43   | Another one that we've got to mention, because we would be doing a desk service to ourselves         |
| 01:17:48   | as well as the rest of the universe if we did not, [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                  |
| 01:17:52   | [[Keyboard Maestro]] is so much more than a Shortcuts utility app, but it can run Shortcuts and           |
| 01:17:56   | it can be run from Shortcuts.                                                                        |
| 01:17:59   | And it can also do some other stuff as well, like calculating things, which can include              |
| 01:18:04   | more than just calculating stuff, like it can filter things and stuff as well.                       |
| 01:18:10   | Like it's, yeah, [[Keyboard Maestro]] definitely deserves a mention.                                      |
| 01:18:17   | We can't talk about it now because we're going to run out of universe if we try and                  |
| 01:18:21   | fit that into this podcast episode, but yeah, you should be checking it out.                         |
| 01:18:26   | There's something fundamentally wrong if we have an automator's episode and [[Keyboard Maestro]]          |
| 01:18:29   | doesn't get mentioned once, so there you go.                                                         |
| 01:18:32   | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                       |
| 01:18:33   | It's like the people on loss that got to type in the numbers every hour.                             |
| 01:18:36   | We got to mention [[Keyboard Maestro]] every episode.                                                     |
| 01:18:39   | Yes.                                                                                                 |
| 01:18:40   | I also, I've just realised, David, I nearly did automators listeners a huge disservice.              |
| 01:18:45   | I forgot to mention Mail Assistant.                                                                  |
| 01:18:48   | Now this is an app that most people don't know exists, but if you want to send markdown              |
| 01:18:53   | format or write an email in markdown formatted text and then send it via shortcuts or any            |
| 01:18:59   | kind of automation system on your Mac, there's no way of doing that.                                 |
| 01:19:05   | It just doesn't work.                                                                                |
| 01:19:06   | So Greg Pierce, developer of [[Drafts]], created this little app called Mail Assistant.                  |
| 01:19:11   | It's free to download and use, and basically it exists to allow you to send mail properly            |
| 01:19:17   | using [[Drafts]] on the Mac.                                                                             |
| 01:19:21   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:19:22   | But it has a shortcut section as well.                                                               |
| 01:19:25   | And it will let you have a checkbox for it, send this as HTML and what to send it from               |
| 01:19:30   | in the subject and adding twos and CCs and BCCs and stuff.                                           |
| 01:19:35   | So yeah, Mail Assistant, have to mention that.                                                       |
| 01:19:37   | Yeah, how could we forget?                                                                           |
| 01:19:39   | Greg Pierce is such a treasure to the automation community because he sees a problem and he          |
| 01:19:45   | just solves it, and he just keeps doing that.                                                        |
| 01:19:49   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:19:50   | All right, well, look, this is quite a list.                                                         |
| 01:19:53   | This was a lot of fun.                                                                               |
| 01:19:55   | I think in the future, if you have questions about some of these specifically, let us know.          |
| 01:20:01   | If you try some and an action isn't working right for you or whatnot, there is a feedback            |
| 01:20:06   | form at the Relay website.                                                                           |
| 01:20:07   | We want to do some more question and answer shows because I feel like those really help              |
| 01:20:10   | a lot of people, and we'd love you to let us know.                                                   |
| 01:20:13   | If you're trying to implement these or do something and you think it should work and                 |
| 01:20:16   | it's not, let us know because we've given you a lot today.                                           |
| 01:20:20   | Now go try and make something with it and let us know how it goes.                                   |
| 01:20:24   | Exactly.                                                                                             |
| 01:20:25   | And it's so much fun diving into these apps as well.                                                 |
| 01:20:30   | It's great.                                                                                          |
| 01:20:31   | That's it.                                                                                           |
| 01:20:32   | I will say, if you're going to send us a bug report for an app, please make sure to send             |
| 01:20:35   | that to the developers of the app, and there'll be a contact button in the app store for all         |
| 01:20:42   | of the apps that we've mentioned.                                                                    |
| 01:20:44   | And if you have any bugs related to Alex's apps or focus cuts or push cut or something,              |
| 01:20:48   | please don't send them to me.                                                                        |
| 01:20:50   | Send them to the right email address because then they go into the right like buckets and            |
| 01:20:53   | get dealt with appropriately and save landing in my inbox, which currently has a very large          |
| 01:20:57   | number of unread emails.                                                                             |
| 01:20:58   | I'm going to have to figure out some kind of automation for that, David.                             |
| 01:21:02   | Yeah.                                                                                                |
| 01:21:03   | Well, we have to get on that Rose.                                                                   |
| 01:21:05   | Anyway, we are the Automators podcast.                                                               |

| 01:21:10   | We will not thank our sponsors this week, and that's our friends at Express VPN and                  |

| 01:21:17   | We're going to be talking about Rose's new implementation of OCR automation and travel.              |
| 01:21:22   | That is the ad free extended version of the show.                                                    |
| 01:21:24   | We'd love to have you join.                                                                          |
| 01:21:25   | You can do that also at relay.fm/automators.                                                   |

| 01:21:31   | Goodbye, folks.                                                                                      |

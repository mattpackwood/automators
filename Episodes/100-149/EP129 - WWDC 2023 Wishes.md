| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automators, the Automation Podcast, where we talk about getting your            |
| 00:06      | technology to do your work for you, or at least how we wish your technology could do                  |
| 00:10      | your work for you, because that is the topic of today's episode.                                      |
| 00:14      | My name is Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined, as always, by my pal and co-host, David Sparks.         |
| 00:18      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                              |
| 00:19      | Great, Rose.                                                                                          |
| 00:20      | I feel like this is definitely a wish-based episode.                                                  |
| 00:24      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                             |
| 00:25      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 00:26      | I've got a smart water bottle right here on my desk, it's stainless steel, I'm rubbing                |
| 00:28      | it, there's no genie, but I'm hopeful that Disney Magic is still present somewhere in                 |
| 00:33      | the world, perhaps, maybe.                                                                            |
| 00:35      | But either way, we're publishing this shortly before [[WWDC]], so assuming that there is plenty           |
| 00:42      | of magic running around, we may see some of these, or maybe the Shortcuts team and the                |
| 00:48      | Automation teams at [[Apple]] are actually just very smart, and they've been listening to                 |
| 00:53      | the things that we've mentioned offhand over the last year or so, and been forming those              |
| 00:57      | into actual features that we'll see at [[WWDC]] in just a week or so.                                     |
| 01:02      | Yeah, I feel like if we want to make this show more influential, we should probably                   |
| 01:05      | do it in January, because...                                                                          |
| 01:08      | I feel like, actually, now is a great time to be doing it, but iOS 17 is going to come                |
| 01:13      | out in September.                                                                                     |
| 01:14      | This wish list is probably realistically iOS 18, because that's how much development lead              |
| 01:18      | time you need with testing and everything else to get it in as a big feature in the                   |
| 01:23      | [[WWDC]] keynote.                                                                                         |
| 01:24      | But, of course, there will be updates later.                                                          |
| 01:27      | But that's the idea today, is we're heading into [[WWDC]].                                                |
| 01:30      | We don't know what's going to come out.                                                               |
| 01:31      | As of this recording, there haven't been massive leak bombs.                                          |
| 01:36      | And you don't normally get those on Automation, because it's not sexy enough to warrant leak          |
| 01:41      | bombs, but Rose and I are Automators, and we've been using this stuff with limitations                |
| 01:48      | and complaints over the last year, and we thought it would be a good opportunity to                   |
| 01:52      | kind of share our wish list for what we'd like to see them add to the various platforms               |
| 01:58      | and automation tools to make it easier.                                                               |
| 02:01      | I mean, I feel like one of the nice points of insight Rose and I get is we get to interact            |
| 02:05      | with the listeners via social media, email, and whatnot.                                              |
| 02:09      | And we do hear where people are hitting friction points, and we're hitting them ourselves.            |
| 02:13      | So we actually do have a pretty good point of view here as to what we should be doing.                |
| 02:18      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 02:19      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 02:20      | And it's one of those things where sometimes the things that are missing or feel a little             |
| 02:26      | bit uncomfortable to use, like sometimes that can just be, ah, right, okay, well, I need              |
| 02:30      | to find the right way to use it, or, okay, now I understand how this slows.                           |
| 02:34      | And sometimes everything feels okay to start with, and you're just kind of putting it down            |
| 02:39      | to something being new.                                                                               |
| 02:40      | But then as time goes on, you go, oh, no, no, actually, there's something missing here                |
| 02:44      | that's making this uncomfortable, or it doesn't feel like it flows when it comes to                   |
| 02:49      | something like this.                                                                                  |
| 02:50      | So then, you know, that's when something gets added onto my wish list at any rate.                    |
| 02:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 02:56      | Well, we have quite a few things we'd like to see added.                                              |
| 02:58      | So we're going to be going through them today.                                                        |
| 03:01      | For the bonus section for Automator's Max, which is the version of the show you get that's            |
| 03:07      | ad-free and has additional content, Rose today and I are going to be talking about how to             |
| 03:12      | best view [[WWDC]] and how to get the goods on all the stuff we're talking about today.                   |
| 03:17      | So we'll be covering that in detail in Automator's Max later, but we've got some categories here.     |
| 03:23      | Let's start with the first one that we are generally calling OS improvements, you know,               |
| 03:30      | improvements to the general operating system that will make life easier for automators.               |
| 03:34      | Yes, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 03:36      | And, you know, there's quite a few things that you could say, like, you know, is this                 |
| 03:41      | really something that we're kind of looking for from shortcuts, or is this kind of something          |
| 03:45      | that we're looking for in the OS itself?                                                              |
| 03:48      | And it's one of those things where, yeah, I'm in two minds about some of my things that               |
| 03:53      | I've put in some of these, and I'm literally just moving one as we talk right now because             |
| 03:56      | I feel like I put it in the wrong category earlier.                                                   |
| 03:59      | But, you know, focus modes is something that we both use, and I'm sure many people use                |
| 04:04      | this to an extent, even if it's just the sleep one and the driving one.                               |
| 04:09      | But I feel like focus modes, focus modes in general, they're great, and I really love                 |
| 04:14      | what they've already done, they've added, you know, the lock screen and the home screen               |
| 04:17      | wallpapers, and the ability to choose your home screens and set your watch face.                      |
| 04:23      | And then, you know, filter things like your mail accounts and so on.                                  |
| 04:26      | But I feel like there's more they can do there.                                                       |
| 04:30      | And I know that you definitely agree, David, starting with more focus modes.                          |
| 04:34      | Yeah, I am very much a focus modes advocate, and I actually lately have been really thinking          |
| 04:40      | about focus modes and my relationship with them because I use them all day.                           |
| 04:44      | Right now, I'm in podcasting focus mode, which means that the only people that will                   |
| 04:48      | be able to get through to me other than Rose, Steven, and Mike Schmitz are my wife.                   |
| 04:55      | And otherwise, anything's going to go straight to message, and I'm just, you know, the world          |
| 04:58      | is basically cut off from me so I can focus on making a really good podcast.                          |
| 05:02      | And what I would really like is the ability to make one called automators focus mode.                 |
| 05:07      | And then Mike Schmitz and Steven Hackett would get cut out for the purpose of this recording.         |
| 05:12      | But we only get 10.                                                                                   |
| 05:13      | And so I don't have enough slots, you know, to have one for each show.                                |
| 05:17      | And so that's that's an improvement.                                                                  |
| 05:19      | But I guess I would first start by saying there's certainly a case to be made that this is an         |
| 05:24      | automator thing because focus modes can be triggered automatically or by time or by calendar          |
| 05:30      | event.                                                                                                |
| 05:31      | You really can, if you're an automator, you can get way more out of focus modes.                      |
| 05:35      | But the limitation is some of the built-in stuff.                                                     |
| 05:39      | It just doesn't go far enough.                                                                        |
| 05:40      | Like, why do we only get 10?                                                                          |
| 05:42      | I feel like that's a complete arbitrary number.                                                       |
| 05:45      | Somebody had to type in an integer at some point and they decided 10 was the number.                  |
| 05:50      | Rose is a programmer.                                                                                 |
| 05:51      | You probably got it better than me.                                                                   |
| 05:52      | I'm sure it couldn't be a thousand, but I suspect it could be more than 10.                           |
| 05:56      | I mean, technically, like assuming that this doesn't take up oodles of space on your device,          |
| 06:01      | which realistically, this is a text list in some way, shape, or form or the multitude                 |
| 06:07      | of properties, it shouldn't be taking up that much physical storage space.                            |
| 06:12      | But I suspect that one of the reasons why they've gone with 10 is just a simple case                  |
| 06:15      | of users going to be users, which is people will set things up in a complex fashion and               |
| 06:24      | so on and make it make it difficult for themselves.                                                   |
| 06:28      | And they won't quite understand why does this thing do this and why does that thing not               |
| 06:32      | do that.                                                                                              |
| 06:33      | So I think they just limited it to 10 because, well, nobody's good at creating more than              |
| 06:37      | 10, but it turns out quite a few people do create 10 or more.                                         |
| 06:40      | And I would certainly like to have more.                                                              |
| 06:42      | And I feel like I do actively limit my use of focus modes.                                            |
| 06:46      | And I'm not in a focus mode all the time just because I don't have enough of them.                    |
| 06:51      | And the other thing is, this is really simple, colours and icons.                                      |
| 06:56      | There are not enough colours and not enough icons to let me do everything as I would like              |
| 07:03      | to do.                                                                                                |
| 07:04      | What I would really like is right now, there's a relatively limited icon list.                        |
| 07:08      | What I would love right now is if they put a dot, dot, dot in the bottom right hand corner            |
| 07:11      | and then they would just let me search the whole [[SF Symbols]] database and I don't care                 |
| 07:15      | if they don't get them pretty names.                                                                  |
| 07:18      | That's fine with me.                                                                                  |
| 07:19      | If I have to have the developer beta installed for this feature to be enabled, I will live            |
| 07:23      | with it.                                                                                              |
| 07:24      | That is fine.                                                                                         |
| 07:25      | But if they could give me a dot, dot, dot so I could have any SF symbol of my choice,                 |
| 07:30      | that would be great because right now there's just not enough.                                        |
| 07:34      | There's quite a few that I don't use.                                                                 |
| 07:36      | There's one that looks like, I guess it would be like a courthouse or something.                      |
| 07:39      | It's like, when am I going to use that?                                                               |
| 07:41      | If you are still a lawyer, David, then you might use that if you're in court focus mode.              |
| 07:47      | But me, I don't have a use case for that at all.                                                      |
| 07:51      | And yet there's a couple of different things here that could be work.                                 |
| 07:55      | There's a credit card.                                                                                |
| 07:57      | Why do I need a credit card focus mode?                                                               |
| 08:00      | I'm not sure what that icon is for, especially considering everything else and there's medications    |
| 08:04      | one.                                                                                                  |
| 08:05      | Well, I guess if you have to go to the hospital regularly for tests, but there's also a stethoscope.  |
| 08:09      | It feels like there's a lot of duplication here and somebody just went through and thought            |
| 08:16      | up a list quickly of symbols and if I'm not wrong, it's actually the same icon list that's            |
| 08:21      | available in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] for you to create like smart lists where you've got those options.             |
| 08:30      | So it does look very, very similar actually.                                                          |
| 08:32      | I think that the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] list has expanded a bit more.                                              |
| 08:36      | So yeah, maybe there should just be parity because the symbols available and colours available         |
| 08:40      | in shortcuts, [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], and focus modes don't actually line up.                                      |
| 08:45      | So just give us more in all the places, please.                                                       |
| 08:47      | Yeah, I mean, that really is a great point, Rose, because I feel like one of the way you              |
| 08:53      | get users to adopt the feature is to allow them to make it more their own and colours                  |
| 08:58      | and icons are very much a part of that.                                                               |
| 09:01      | And [[Apple]] has this rich [[SF Symbols]] database.                                                          |
| 09:04      | There are multiple focus modes I have where my icon is a compromise, right?                           |
| 09:10      | Like the podcasting, when I'm looking at right now my menu bar, it's a set of headphones.             |
| 09:14      | It should be the microphone, but it's not in like if I could have a microphone with                   |
| 09:18      | the red automators colour, that would be even better.                                                  |
| 09:21      | And I feel like this is a simple problem.                                                             |
| 09:24      | Just like adding more of them is a simple problem to solve.                                           |
| 09:27      | I mean, note the stuff we've asked for so far are not complex requests, but they would                |
| 09:34      | drastically improve our ability to use the feature.                                                   |
| 09:37      | Now, let's move into that second piece of it, more complex stuff.                                     |
| 09:41      | I feel like focus modes must have some sort of advocate at [[Apple]] because they did it the              |
| 09:47      | first year they created the feature, which was a lot of work.                                         |
| 09:50      | And then the next year they made significant improvements to the feature.                             |
| 09:55      | Now we can do the inverse where you can say, only show me these people or show me everybody,          |
| 09:59      | but these people.                                                                                     |
| 10:00      | So they've really made it a much better, effective implementation of focus modes.                     |
| 10:06      | What would you like to see them do next, if anything, to improve the actual feature set?              |
| 10:11      | Well, I feel like at the moment, there's a number of system filters that you can add                  |
| 10:17      | in a focus mode.                                                                                      |
| 10:18      | So for example, one of those is the ability to set your always on display to on or off,               |
| 10:29      | set your appearance to light mode or dark mode and turn low power mode on and off.                    |
| 10:32      | And I feel like they can definitely go further with some nice simple ones in here.                    |
| 10:35      | Like turning on and off, announce notifications, for example, or the ability to listen for            |
| 10:42      | the Hey [[Apple]] lady phrase.                                                                            |
| 10:45      | And assuming, and I'm guessing if we get this one, we're not going to hear about until                |
| 10:49      | September, assuming that the hardware switch for the silent mode becomes a button rather              |
| 10:55      | than a switch, silent mode, turning silent mode on and off would be great.                            |
| 11:00      | Setting things like your ring volume.                                                                 |
| 11:01      | So if I'm not in silent mode, and I do want my phone to ring, but I don't want to be ringing          |
| 11:05      | very loudly, or I do want it to be ringing as loudly as possible.                                     |
| 11:10      | Things like that, because a lot of these are things that are available in the control centre,         |
| 11:14      | which is great.                                                                                       |
| 11:15      | I love that.                                                                                          |
| 11:16      | And so it's easy enough to turn them on and off.                                                      |
| 11:20      | But why not just add, you know, add more options there?                                               |
| 11:23      | Allow me to, you know, set my air drop to no one or contacts only.                                    |
| 11:31      | I'm presuming everybody would not be an option because it's everyone for 10 minutes now.              |
| 11:36      | And the other thing is, you know, related to this, you talked about triggers earlier.                 |
| 11:42      | And you know, we can only have at the moment, there are triggers based on time, like a time           |
| 11:48      | of day, which you can then lock into certain days of the week.                                        |
| 11:51      | There are triggers based on locations, and there are triggers based on apps, and then                 |
| 11:55      | there is smart activation, which I have to say due to the fact that I work from home,                 |
| 11:59      | very rarely has worked in the way that I would expect.                                                |
| 12:01      | So I have disabled this on every one of my focus modes.                                               |
| 12:03      | That's not useful to me either.                                                                       |
| 12:05      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:06      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:07      | I would love it if I could say, hey, watch this calendar.                                             |
| 12:11      | When there are events in this calendar, I want you to turn on or when there are events                |
| 12:16      | in this calendar with this word in them in the title, then turn on.                                   |
| 12:22      | And like that would be as complex as I would expect it to get realistically, like either              |
| 12:27      | just watch this calendar or watch events in this calendar with this word.                             |
| 12:31      | I wouldn't expect anything more complex than that.                                                    |
| 12:34      | But I think that that would go a very long way to automating focus modes for folks.                   |
| 12:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 12:40      | Like a link between the calendar, and it could be calendar, it could be calendar event                |
| 12:46      | name or, you know, just creating links between that and triggers for focus modes is great.            |
| 12:51      | I would add to that just in general, the idea of every time you've got something automatically        |
| 12:57      | happening on your devices that you could use focus modes as a filter on that to say, well,            |
| 13:02      | this happens if we're in this focus mode or not, if we're not in this focus mode.                     |
| 13:08      | And that kind of exists, but it doesn't really exist.                                                 |
| 13:10      | I would like to see it become a deeper integration.                                                   |
| 13:14      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:16      | The other thing that I would like to see, because, you know, at the moment we've got                  |
| 13:19      | a home screen, we've got lock screen, we've got watch screen.                                         |
| 13:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 13:24      | I feel like going slightly nerdier here, the ability to adjust your control centre would              |
| 13:32      | be really nice as well.                                                                               |
| 13:35      | Because there are things that I don't need access to in certain focus modes.                          |
| 13:40      | For example, in my work focus mode, I don't need access to the [[Apple TV]] remote.                       |
| 13:45      | That's just something I don't need.                                                                   |
| 13:46      | And in my fitness focus mode, I want access to music recognition.                                     |
| 13:50      | That is something I definitely want, because in my belly class, a number of times that                |
| 13:53      | I'm like, what song is this?                                                                          |
| 13:55      | As we're doing something, it's always like a piano version of the song.                               |
| 13:57      | So it's kind of hit and mess with Shazam, but, you know, being able to add that in there.             |
| 14:02      | And also, I'd love to see some more accessibility features come into certain focus modes.             |
| 14:09      | So for example, adjusting the text size or smart invert and things like that, which I                 |
| 14:15      | know we can do some of through shortcuts.                                                             |
| 14:18      | And I don't want shortcuts to go away, just to be clear.                                              |
| 14:22      | I do not want it to go away.                                                                          |
| 14:24      | But focus modes brought in some things that people were doing with shortcuts already.                 |
| 14:28      | And accessibility shortcuts or accessibility controls on iOS already are great.                       |
| 14:33      | You can even set accessibility controls for specific apps.                                            |
| 14:37      | And I'd love it, as a side note, if we could turn those on and off automatically in shortcuts,        |
| 14:41      | that'd be great.                                                                                      |
| 14:42      | But, you know, the ability to control some of those things that people may need access                |
| 14:48      | to, like, for example, putting the assistive touch thing on or controlling what the side              |
| 14:56      | button does, you know, with the triple click and so on, like, that sort of thing, like                |
| 15:04      | being able to enable and disable that, that would be really great just to have a system               |
| 15:09      | controls that you could filter in your focus modes, you know, I could very much imagine               |
| 15:15      | people having a help my relative focus mode, which is basically it bumps up the text size             |
| 15:21      | and so on, and, you know, maybe sets their phone into silent, gets rid of most notifications          |
| 15:26      | so that they can show their relative or friend how to do something on their phone without             |
| 15:31      | worrying about like notifications popping in and stuff like that.                                     |
| 15:35      | And you know, there are just sometimes where, for example, if I'm going to be using my iPad,          |
| 15:39      | it's going to be a bit further away from me than it usually is, and bumping up the text               |
| 15:42      | size would be really nice.                                                                            |
| 15:43      | And having a focus mode for that, which would then, you know, disable notifications and               |
| 15:48      | stuff as needed as well, would be really nice.                                                        |
| 15:51      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 15:52      | I have one more, because I think the way you and I are going, we could probably do a whole            |
| 15:57      | hour on what we want from focus mode, but yeah, but one other one I would like, just                  |
| 16:01      | like we have on the iPad and iPhone, the ability to set your wallpaper and have all these sorts       |
| 16:08      | of great external notifications of what focus mode you're in.                                         |
| 16:11      | We don't get any of that on the Mac.                                                                  |
| 16:12      | We don't get control over what the wallpaper is.                                                      |
| 16:15      | We don't get control over what's on the widgets on the right side of the screen.                      |
| 16:19      | I would love to see the Mac get more contextual indicators of your focus mode than a little           |
| 16:24      | icon in the menu bar.                                                                                 |
| 16:26      | And like having custom wallpaper, that'd be awesome if we could do that.                              |
| 16:30      | I mean, I'd like to do more than that, but that would be a great start.                               |
| 16:34      | Definitely.                                                                                           |
| 16:35      | And I feel like, as far as OS improvements go, some triggers from shortcuts on Mac OS                 |
| 16:41      | would not go amiss.                                                                                   |
| 16:42      | At the moment, we have triggers for shortcuts on iPhone, we've got triggers for shortcuts             |
| 16:47      | on iPad.                                                                                              |
| 16:48      | We don't have them on the [[Apple Watch]] and we don't have them on the Mac.                              |
| 16:51      | We also don't have them on [[Apple TV]], but that's a little different.                                   |
| 16:53      | I feel like [[Apple TV]] maybe could potentially trigger a focus mode if you're playing something,        |
| 16:58      | but that's a problem for another time, but right now, shortcuts on Mac, no automation                 |
| 17:05      | triggers.                                                                                             |
| 17:06      | And even though there are ways around this to an extent there, there are pretty apps                  |
| 17:12      | and so on, I feel like a lot of people would take a look at it and be like, okay, so when             |
| 17:18      | I look in the gallery overview thing, or when I hear people talk about shortcuts, they'll             |
| 17:24      | like, automatically do this at this time, or when this focus mode starts, and then you                |
| 17:29      | go and look on the Mac and they're like, I can't do any of that, what's going on, I'll                |
| 17:32      | give up, move on.                                                                                     |
| 17:33      | So yeah, it would be nice to see some more options there.                                             |
| 17:38      | Another category under the OS topic is some of the productivity apps that really should               |
| 17:43      | have more automation support.                                                                         |
| 17:45      | And this is the one I have a glimmer of hope for, it's [[Apple Mail]].                                    |
| 17:48      | Last year, we got some new features in [[Apple Mail]], but a lot of the automator stuff didn't            |
| 17:53      | make it into that round, and there is some, they're using [[artificial intelligence]] to try              |
| 17:58      | and figure out who you reply from, and they're trying to help you a little bit with auto              |
| 18:03      | sorting mail.                                                                                         |
| 18:04      | But I feel like this is a topic, or this is an app that could greatly improve with some               |
| 18:09      | more automation triggers.                                                                             |
| 18:11      | It really could, and not just automation triggers, but automation features, like smart mailboxes      |
| 18:16      | on iOS, and things like that, and add some rules on iOS as well.                                      |
| 18:21      | I know that they only run when your app, when your device receives mail, and purses is it.            |
| 18:27      | And I know that having the same thing running in multiple places can be a bit of a problem,           |
| 18:31      | but the fact that mail rules sink a toll makes that slightly problematic.                             |
| 18:35      | But it would be really nice to have, well, maybe actual shortcuts in mail.                            |
| 18:43      | And why say shortcuts?                                                                                |
| 18:44      | I mean, something you could potentially build in the shortcuts app, but it's like, hey,               |
| 18:48      | mark this message as read, flag it, and move it to this folder.                                       |
| 18:53      | Or something like that, just a series of short actions that you can run, which at the moment          |
| 18:59      | everything, this bothers me quite a bit, to be honest, like everything that you want to               |
| 19:03      | do on a message is hidden under the reply button.                                                     |
| 19:06      | And I understand why they've done that, but it really bugs me that like, I have to tap                |
| 19:11      | reply to mark, move to junk, or to mute something, or to say notify me at this time or block          |
| 19:17      | a sender.                                                                                             |
| 19:18      | Or to forward sometimes you have to hit reply forward.                                                |
| 19:21      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 19:22      | It's like, why is this, why is this like this?                                                        |
| 19:25      | And I know that they've got limited amount of space, but I really feel like adding a                  |
| 19:27      | fifth button into the bottom toolbar on a mail on the iPhone wouldn't have been a problem,            |
| 19:33      | especially now that they don't have a mini device.                                                    |
| 19:35      | I mean, it would be really nice to have some smart mailboxes and things like that so that             |
| 19:39      | we could do things more easily.                                                                       |
| 19:41      | And if they don't want to necessarily give us that in the UI, then considering the shortcuts          |
| 19:45      | action support that was added last year for the ability to get and filter data in shortcuts,          |
| 19:52      | let us get our data in shortcuts and filter it as a poor man's smart mailbox proxy.                   |
| 19:58      | So if we can't do a smart mailbox on iOS, then at least let me run a shortcut that will               |
| 20:04      | get all of the things that are flagged and in this folder and marked as unread, for example,          |
| 20:11      | so that I can look for those items so that I can action them.                                         |
| 20:16      | Agreed.                                                                                               |
| 20:17      | I agreed with all of that, but I would say that I feel like mail is ripe.                             |
| 20:24      | And this is a year where we're going to find out if last year was a fluke or if last year             |
| 20:27      | was the beginning of a trend because some of the [[Apple]] productivity apps and notes and                |
| 20:32      | [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] in particular got better and then kept getting better and some get like one                 |
| 20:38      | year of support and then they kind of go back into the wilderness.                                    |
| 20:41      | And I don't know what that will be this year, but if they were going to improve mail, they            |
| 20:45      | should definitely work on the automation elements of it and even some of the things like deferred     |
| 20:51      | mailboxes and some of the features that people are finding in almost every mail app these             |
| 20:56      | days.                                                                                                 |
| 20:57      | I have to ask you, Rose, I was thinking, are you using [[Apple Mail]] for anything these days?            |
| 21:04      | Are you using any of your devices?                                                                    |
| 21:06      | Yeah, I use it on all of my devices.                                                                  |
| 21:09      | And honestly, another thing that I've just thought of that I have to say, especially                  |
| 21:14      | because even if you've only got a week left, [[Apple]] developer, as you listen to this, I                |
| 21:19      | think you can do it.                                                                                  |
| 21:20      | I believe in you.                                                                                     |
| 21:22      | There is the action for a Mail rule to run [[AppleScript]].                                              |
| 21:27      | At the moment, if I want to run a shortcut, I have to say, "tell application shortcuts                 |
| 21:32      | to run blah, blah, blah shortcut".                                                                     |
| 21:34      | And it doesn't really work.                                                                           |
| 21:36      | It would be amazing if you would let me run a shortcut.                                               |
| 21:39      | Like where it says run [[AppleScript]] and the line that runs shortcut.                                  |
| 21:43      | Even if it only makes it vaguely into the keynote, it's like a thing and then it kind                 |
| 21:47      | of disappears for a couple of months and then maybe reappears and actually works later.               |
| 21:51      | I would love that because at the moment, if you want to automate something in mail and                |
| 21:57      | you create a mail rule, which will definitely help, once you get past setting the colour,              |
| 22:06      | playing sound, I never use play sound or bounce icon in doc or send notification.                     |
| 22:13      | I don't really use reply to forward or redirect either.                                               |
| 22:17      | I have previously used redirect, but I find those are better on server side rules anyway.             |
| 22:21      | I do use delete message, markers read, markers flagged, and move message.                             |
| 22:28      | I don't really use copy message, but as well as run [[AppleScript]], I'd love it if I could              |
| 22:33      | run a shortcut, that would be so great.                                                               |
| 22:38      | Fingers crossed, we'll get to see some of that because yeah, I think we're at the point               |
| 22:41      | where not only do we want the actions in shortcuts, but we want them everywhere else in the OS        |
| 22:45      | as well.                                                                                              |
| 22:48      | Give me a little new button in notes where when I tap and hold on it, it gives me like                |
| 22:53      | new blah, blah, blah from this template where it automatically pops up and asks me three              |
| 22:58      | questions and then it puts some data together through a shortcut.                                     |
| 23:02      | That's a special notes template kind of shortcut that I've been able to put together or something.    |
| 23:07      | Another great thing we'd like is parity of features because [[Apple Mail]] suffers right                  |
| 23:13      | now.                                                                                                  |
| 23:14      | There are things that work on one platform that don't work on the other.                              |
| 23:17      | It's also true for their shortcut support.                                                            |
| 23:18      | You've got shortcuts implementation on one platform, primarily mobile has more features               |
| 23:24      | than the Mac does.                                                                                    |
| 23:25      | I'd like to see those things get balanced out this year.                                              |
| 23:28      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 23:29      | We're seeing this in a couple of apps, you know, [[Apple Mail\|Mail]] and [[Safari]] and so on and it would              |
| 23:35      | just be really nice to just see things that when they appear, they appear everywhere because          |
| 23:41      | right now it really is kind of a haphazard guess when you see that there's a new shortcut             |
| 23:47      | action.                                                                                               |
| 23:48      | Like is this going to work on Mac?                                                                    |
| 23:52      | You kind of have to just open the Mac app and go look and see if it's there and sometimes             |
| 23:55      | it is there and sometimes it'll like appear later or and then sometimes the action doesn't            |
| 24:02      | work and it will just crash your device or crash your shortcut at least.                              |
| 24:07      | So for example, the vibrate action on Mac, yeah, yeah, that still crashes, that still                 |
| 24:11      | bugs me.                                                                                              |
| 24:12      | So, yeah, I'm really hoping for like an OS level thing of just like, hey, if this action              |
| 24:18      | is not supported on this device, please just continue and carry on as though I'd never                |
| 24:23      | actually tried to do this.                                                                            |
| 24:25      | And that would be really, really nice.                                                                |
| 24:26      | I mean, the sad thing is you and I get caught up in these tricks and we make a podcast about          |
| 24:30      | automation and you still forget once in a while because there's so many of these circumstances        |
| 24:35      | where this happens and for people who are trying to learn this stuff, you're going to                 |
| 24:39      | hit a couple of those things and you're just going to give up.                                        |
| 24:42      | Yeah, it can be really tricky to figure this out, you know, and I don't know how many times           |
| 24:48      | you've had this, David, where you reboot your iPhone or your iPad and you unlock your device          |
| 24:54      | as soon as it reboots.                                                                                |
| 24:56      | And then you get a notification that says, automations will not run until your device                 |
| 25:01      | has been unlocked.                                                                                    |
| 25:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 25:03      | I've already unlocked it, like I'm typing in [[Drafts]] right now, like how much more unlocked            |
| 25:09      | can we be?                                                                                            |
| 25:10      | So, yeah, there's some improvements to come there, but you know, we've got some shortcuts             |
| 25:14      | improvements to talk about as well.                                                                   |

| 26:08      | You just build and collect your most commonly used phrases, messages, URLs and more right             |
| 26:13      | within TextExpander and then create your chosen abbreviation and they'll be with you                 |
| 26:18      | wherever you type.                                                                                    |
| 26:19      | I can tell you as someone who has literally thousands of TextExpander abbreviations,                 |
| 26:24      | I love it and I use it every day.                                                                     |
| 26:26      | It's a great entry point for automation.                                                              |
| 26:29      | You can even customise the snippets by having them automatically add in dates, fill in the            |
| 26:33      | blank fields, timestamps and more and this will make sure that you still keep the personality         |
| 26:38      | and communications that you send.                                                                     |
| 26:41      | TextExpander is available on any device you use across any app you use on Mac, Windows,              |
| 26:46      | Chrome and iOS.                                                                                       |
| 26:48      | What I love most about TextExpander is its power.                                                    |
| 26:50      | Sure, it's a text expansion tool, but it can be so much more because you can put scripts              |
| 26:55      | in, you can have it automatically insert the date or the clipboard.                                   |
| 26:59      | As you dig in with TextExpander, you're going to find ways to use it more powerfully than            |
| 27:03      | you could use any other text replacement tool.                                                        |
| 27:06      | It sends me reports of the amount of time I save and literally every year I save days                 |
| 27:10      | of my life with TextExpander.                                                                        |

| 27:33      | All right, let's move into shortcuts now.                                                             |
| 27:36      | We've been talking about general OS improvements, but both of us are big users of shortcuts.          |
| 27:43      | We definitely have our lists of things we'd like to get improved.                                     |
| 27:46      | Let's dig in on that now.                                                                             |
| 27:48      | I'll kick it off.                                                                                     |
| 27:49      | I'll just say more triggers.                                                                          |
| 27:51      | I feel like the [[Apple]] has made a lot of progress towards making more triggers, but there aren't       |
| 27:57      | enough of them.                                                                                       |
| 27:58      | I think we're at a time now where a third-party app should be allowed to give us shortcut             |
| 28:05      | triggers.                                                                                             |
| 28:06      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 28:07      | And even if this just starts with a tap-to-run thing, I'd be okay with that.                          |
| 28:13      | But obviously, David, you and I both want automations in the true sense of the word                   |
| 28:19      | where we can turn off like asked before running.                                                      |
| 28:23      | And maybe if you go into settings or system settings on Mac OS and you go look for shortcuts,         |
| 28:31      | there are some advanced toggles that you can turn on there to allow you to do more dangerous          |
| 28:37      | things as far as [[Apple]] is concerned.                                                                  |
| 28:40      | And I'm just looking for this because I accidentally scrolled way too far and it turns out I've       |
| 28:45      | got a lot of apps installed on my phone, so I now can't find shortcuts.                               |
| 28:49      | But yes, it's things like being able to delete large amounts of data and stuff like that              |
| 28:55      | in the advanced settings and deleting that confirmation and sharing large amounts of                  |
| 28:59      | data and running scripts, those options.                                                              |
| 29:02      | If I had to have a toggle that said allow third-party triggers for me to do this, I'd                 |
| 29:08      | be okay with that, but it would be really nice if various different apps could hook                   |
| 29:13      | in and be like, oh, hey, this thing has happened.                                                     |
| 29:17      | Now, obviously, there are going to have to be limitations on this.                                    |
| 29:20      | I can't imagine [[Apple]] being like, yeah, OmniFocus can run an automation every time you create         |
| 29:25      | a new task.                                                                                           |
| 29:27      | I don't think that's necessarily something that I'd want, but for example, if I run                   |
| 29:32      | an Omni Automation script in OmniFocus and then I want that to trigger something, that                 |
| 29:40      | would be really nice because then Omni don't have to pull all of the OS features into their           |
| 29:45      | app the way [[Drafts]] has had to do to an extent with the scripting.                                     |
| 29:50      | And also, I as an end user don't have to have as difficult a time of it of trying to do               |
| 29:54      | it this way and this app and this way and this app, and then this app passes off from                 |
| 29:57      | this app to this app, which then eventually runs this shortcut, which does this thing                 |
| 30:00      | and it gets messy very quickly.                                                                       |
| 30:03      | Now, obviously, Omni Automations can run a shortcut already, but being able to trigger                 |
| 30:09      | something automatically on your devices, that's pretty powerful and that could be very useful.        |
| 30:16      | Somebody could share their location with you and find my and then find my because it were             |
| 30:23      | taking advantage of this could say, oh, hey, this person has shared their location with               |
| 30:28      | you for an hour.                                                                                      |
| 30:31      | I am going to do this thing of send a message, which says, hey, thanks for that.                      |
| 30:37      | See you soon or whatever it is.                                                                       |
| 30:40      | Depending on whatever you want to set up, that'd be really nice.                                      |
| 30:44      | And I don't know, maybe we'd see more stuff coming out from inside of [[Apple]] as well as                |
| 30:47      | outside of [[Apple]].                                                                                     |
| 30:49      | I understand the security argument.                                                                   |
| 30:51      | I know that causes some consternation, but a setting that says, hey, do you really want               |
| 30:56      | to do this would be enough for me.                                                                    |
| 31:00      | And I think for a lot of people that would be interested in the feature, I mean, the                  |
| 31:03      | thing you have to think about with automation is a lot of this stuff is not going to get              |
| 31:06      | used by the vast majority of people.                                                                  |
| 31:08      | So when you're building it out, maybe you can consider that people that want stuff like               |
| 31:13      | this are going to be a little bit more advanced, I don't know.                                        |
| 31:17      | But I do feel like if they want the automation platform to expand, then having third party            |
| 31:25      | triggers is going to help that.                                                                       |
| 31:27      | And when you look at some of the stuff you can do in [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] with automation versus                 |
| 31:32      | what you can do in OmniFocus, it's solely because one is made by the platform vendor                  |
| 31:37      | and one is not.                                                                                       |
| 31:38      | And I'd like to get to see it a little bit more of an even playing field.                             |
| 31:42      | I feel like some of the third party developers would do a very good job of coming up with             |
| 31:47      | ideas to further automation that way.                                                                 |
| 31:50      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 31:51      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                        |
| 31:52      | And I think it's one of those things where there may be a little bit of the chicken and               |
| 31:56      | the egg problem here.                                                                                 |
| 31:57      | So Microsoft Windows Phone failed because there were no apps, because there were no users             |
| 32:01      | and there were no users because there were no apps.                                                   |
| 32:04      | And I have a feeling that, you know, with shortcuts, we're going to reach that point                  |
| 32:07      | at some point, possibly in the not too distant future, of there will be people who don't              |
| 32:11      | use shortcuts because it doesn't support the things that they want and need.                          |
| 32:16      | And [[Apple]] will look at it from one perspective and go, well, people don't really want to              |
| 32:21      | use shortcuts all that much.                                                                          |
| 32:22      | So, you know, we're not going to give the team more space for growth.                                 |
| 32:26      | And I really hope that that's not the case because it seems to me, you know, based on                 |
| 32:30      | what I'm seeing online, that there are more and more users for shortcuts every time I                 |
| 32:34      | go looking and more and more use cases and more and more sites talking about this as                  |
| 32:38      | a mainstream thing, which is great.                                                                   |
| 32:41      | But I do think it's one of those things where they're going to need to give people the opportunity    |
| 32:46      | to go a little bit wild, go a bit mad, go crazy.                                                      |
| 32:50      | Let David and I and Matthew and all the other shortcuts nerds like [[Federico Viticci]] just go            |
| 32:56      | nuts and see what we can do with this with a couple of great app developers.                          |
| 33:01      | And you know, at the moment, if you want to send an emergency notification, like a critical           |
| 33:07      | alert from an iPhone app, you have to ask [[Apple]] for a special allowance for this.                     |
| 33:14      | I could quite easily see this being a special allowance request type thing of I would like            |
| 33:20      | to trigger shortcuts, automations and having to go through a separate review process when             |
| 33:24      | you apply for that at the moment, just to get started.                                                |
| 33:29      | And then later open it up to more people, but then they could start by opening up to                  |
| 33:33      | trusted developers who've got, you know, a long time history of working with [[Apple]] or                 |
| 33:37      | working in this sort of area and then expand it from there and see what the masses come               |
| 33:42      | up with after that.                                                                                   |
| 33:44      | But I do think they should just let people go mad for a bit and see what happens.                     |
| 33:49      | Because you know, they've taken features away from us before.                                         |
| 33:51      | I don't want a seizure taken away, but if that's going to make somebody at [[Apple]] say,                 |
| 33:56      | go on then, then, you know, I'll pretend to let you take it away later and be polite about            |
| 34:01      | it when you do.                                                                                       |
| 34:02      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 34:03      | I think that's a fair statement and I don't know that we're going to get it, but Wishes               |
| 34:08      | is in the title of the show, so why not?                                                              |
| 34:11      | But that third party triggers would be a massive improvement or it would just be a massive            |
| 34:18      | explosion of new ideas for automation.                                                                |
| 34:21      | Yes, definitely.                                                                                      |
| 34:24      | Something else that I'd like to see is at the moment you can use accessibility to trigger             |
| 34:30      | shortcuts and run them.                                                                               |
| 34:31      | So for example, the back tap and so on.                                                               |
| 34:34      | And this is great, but at the moment it feels like we're suffering a little bit from splintering      |
| 34:39      | of, I can use shortcuts from the triple click of the side button on my phone.                         |
| 34:45      | I can use it from the double back tap and the triple back tap and I can use it from                   |
| 34:49      | the assistive touch menu.                                                                             |
| 34:52      | And I can set it up to be run from particular button clicks on a mouse or a trackpad.                 |
| 34:58      | If I connect that via Bluetooth to an iPad.                                                           |
| 35:01      | And I can also set it up for hot corner usage on an iPad.                                             |
| 35:04      | And then on macOS, of course, we've got our global keyboard shortcut triggers.                        |
| 35:09      | And trying to find all the places where I've set up shortcuts so that they can be run automatically   |
| 35:14      | kind of difficult slash impossible because I don't remember everywhere I've gone in and               |
| 35:20      | played with something and set it up.                                                                  |
| 35:23      | And so one of my requests, which leads me to a second request, which I'll explain in                  |
| 35:28      | a moment, is to pull all of those accessibility features where I can run a shortcut automatically     |
| 35:35      | into the automation tab on my iPhone and my iPad.                                                     |
| 35:39      | Because if they are there as options, and I understand why they're not to be clear,                   |
| 35:45      | because the accessibility, sorry, the accessibility shortcut triggers are a this thing does that.     |
| 35:54      | Personal automations, if I want to create seven personal automations when my work focus               |
| 35:58      | mode starts, I can do that.                                                                           |
| 36:01      | Now I don't think they want seven different things happening when you like back tap on                |
| 36:06      | your phone.                                                                                           |
| 36:07      | And that's why it's an accessibility one.                                                             |
| 36:08      | But they could figure out a way to disable these.                                                     |
| 36:12      | And I think that this would be very useful, not only because it would allow me as a user              |
| 36:17      | to see where I've connected up things in the past and easily disable it, even when I don't            |
| 36:23      | remember where it was.                                                                                |
| 36:25      | But it would also, it'll look to people like we've got new triggers, yay.                             |
| 36:30      | And so, you know, that would be very good.                                                            |
| 36:32      | And then related to this, I would really love to see where I'm using a shortcut.                      |
| 36:38      | Because at the moment, one shortcut can run another shortcut, which is great.                         |
| 36:42      | I do not know which shortcut can run what shortcut, or runs what shortcut.                            |
| 36:47      | I know that technically every shortcut can run every other shortcut.                                  |
| 36:50      | But I have no idea.                                                                                   |
| 36:51      | I have no way of telling without going into some very, very nerdy stuff of what shortcut              |
| 36:57      | is using what other shortcut, and it would be really, really great to be able to find                 |
| 37:03      | that out.                                                                                             |
| 37:04      | You know, at the moment, when you open shortcut, there's that info sheet where you've got             |
| 37:08      | your details.                                                                                         |
| 37:09      | I feel like a lovely section in there would be used via run shortcut in list of shortcuts.            |
| 37:17      | And when I tap on it, it opens the shortcut for me.                                                   |
| 37:20      | And yeah, it would be really nice to see both of those so that then, you know, I know where           |
| 37:26      | my shortcuts are being called from, both from the triggers perspective, from the accessibility        |
| 37:31      | perspectives, and also from other shortcuts perspectives as well.                                     |
| 37:35      | And I know that this isn't going to cover everything because it won't cover this is being used        |
| 37:39      | by this automation on another device.                                                                 |
| 37:42      | And that's, that's okay.                                                                              |
| 37:43      | I'm okay with that.                                                                                   |
| 37:44      | But I would really like to at least go, okay, on this device, this shortcut is being used             |
| 37:48      | here, here, here and here.                                                                            |
| 37:50      | Because then if I'm going to make a change to it, then I know that it needs to be continue            |
| 37:54      | working in those places and at the moment, the way I'm trying to do it is by having a                 |
| 37:57      | comment at the top of a shortcut and writing in like, run by this automation, that automation,        |
| 38:03      | this shortcut, that shortcut, and it gets out of date very, very quickly and it's not great.          |
| 38:07      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:08      | I mean, I think that that's definitely a power user problem, but you know, power users                |
| 38:13      | are where we're going to figure this stuff out.                                                       |
| 38:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 38:16      | And honestly, like the fact that if I were to buy a new iPhone in September, which let's              |
| 38:21      | face it, I probably will, and then I set up that iPhone from new, I will not have any                 |
| 38:27      | of my automations for shortcuts.                                                                      |
| 38:31      | So the best way if I want to keep any of the data, any of the setups in automations is                |
| 38:35      | shortcuts is to create them as a shortcut and use run shortcut with the exception of                  |
| 38:41      | a few like the ones triggered by mail or messages because they don't get the content of mail          |
| 38:45      | and so on.                                                                                            |
| 38:46      | If they're like in a, in another shortcut, but that's okay.                                           |
| 38:50      | But the problem with that is then I need to know if I'm using that shortcut or not.                   |
| 38:54      | And yeah, it's, it's one of those things where at the very least the trigger side of it,              |
| 38:59      | like knowing this shortcut is run in this trigger because you have to create a shortcut               |
| 39:05      | to use as an automation trigger for accessibility purposes, you know, the accessibility ones          |
| 39:12      | can't just run shortcut and then it's an automation where it doesn't have a name or anything.         |
| 39:18      | It's just a series of actions.                                                                        |
| 39:20      | It has to be a specifically named shortcut, which is why I think that this would be very              |
| 39:25      | useful to have inside of the info button in shortcuts or the info sheet in shortcuts,                 |
| 39:31      | where it says run by XYZ accessibility trigger, like, you know, triple click home button,             |
| 39:37      | double back tap, triple back tap, et cetera, so that you know where this is called from.              |
| 39:42      | And then if they expand that to the run shortcut action for the people who are using that,            |
| 39:46      | then that would be very nice.                                                                         |
| 39:47      | Well, I would like to see, and we kind of mentioned this in the last segment, but just                |
| 39:52      | in general, a parody audit of Mac OS shortcuts versus mobile shortcuts, because, and I'm              |
| 40:00      | not going to go into a great length as we talked about, but there are, it's not just                  |
| 40:03      | [[Apple Mail]].                                                                                           |
| 40:04      | There are tons of situations in these two versions of shortcuts where actions just                    |
| 40:10      | don't work across the platforms and sometimes cause catastrophic failure of your automation.          |
| 40:16      | And I feel like that it's been two years, no longer should that be a thing.                           |
| 40:19      | And I'm not saying that everything has to work on the other device, but at least it                   |
| 40:23      | shouldn't break your shortcut.                                                                        |
| 40:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 40:25      | And that, that's why I'd really like it just, hey, this device doesn't support vibrate,               |
| 40:30      | just keep going, like carry on.                                                                       |
| 40:33      | It's fine.                                                                                            |
| 40:34      | We don't really care.                                                                                 |
| 40:35      | Like if I could vibrate, I would vibrate, but I can't vibrate.                                        |
| 40:38      | So instead of just stopping, like just continue with life as normal, please.                          |
| 40:45      | By all means, throw up an error message, but throw up an error message and keep on running.           |
| 40:50      | And speaking of error messages, and it's notification error, blah, blah, blah, blah.                  |
| 40:56      | How many times have I seen this or some weird, indecipherable text with the shortcuts icon            |
| 41:04      | next to it?                                                                                           |
| 41:06      | This is usually when an automation has gone wrong in a very unexpected fashion.                       |
| 41:11      | And I will allow that most people probably haven't seen exactly what I've seen, because               |
| 41:16      | I do run developer betas.                                                                             |
| 41:17      | And this is, you know, the penalty that you pay for in developer betas, you get to see                |
| 41:21      | the really weird stuff when it goes wrong.                                                            |
| 41:24      | But I'm sure at some point or another, most people have seen that, like, your shortcuts               |
| 41:30      | automation failed.                                                                                    |
| 41:33      | And they tap on it and it opens the automations tab in shortcuts.                                     |
| 41:37      | Nice.                                                                                                 |
| 41:39      | Which one of my automations failed?                                                                   |
| 41:42      | I don't know.                                                                                         |
| 41:43      | I tapped on that notification, so now it's gone away, so I don't even have the notification           |
| 41:47      | anymore.                                                                                              |
| 41:48      | Not that it told me any more information than that.                                                   |
| 41:50      | But I'd really love some better error messages.                                                       |
| 41:53      | And also, one in particular that I would really like is at the moment, if you add share sheet         |
| 42:01      | support to a shortcut, and then you say, if there's no input, stop and respond, then it               |
| 42:08      | will just respond with whatever you type in there.                                                    |
| 42:11      | So if I just type the word hello in there, and then I run this shortcut, which I do need              |
| 42:17      | to add a message to, an action to first, it just says hello.                                          |
| 42:22      | And if I'm running it inside of shortcuts, that's fine, because it will actually show                 |
| 42:27      | me the name of the shortcut.                                                                          |
| 42:28      | But if I run it from somewhere else, it doesn't show me the name, at least it didn't last             |
| 42:32      | time I checked this.                                                                                  |
| 42:34      | And so I actually don't necessarily know what's running this when it just says that.                  |
| 42:42      | Or if it's run through another shortcut again, I don't necessarily know.                              |
| 42:46      | And that can cause quite a bit of confusion.                                                          |
| 42:49      | So it would be nice to just have better messaging and specifically error messaging in general.        |
| 42:54      | Now, I know that some things are very hard to figure out exactly what something's going               |
| 43:00      | to be coming up as there, but it would be very nice if somebody could look into that                  |
| 43:05      | and go, aha, this is what we need to do here to make this come up like that, where you                |
| 43:12      | have got the name of the shortcut and the icon of your shortcut, or you've got the name               |
| 43:16      | of the automation that failed.                                                                        |
| 43:17      | Or when you tap on an automation failed notification, it opens that one.                              |
| 43:22      | And when you clear your notifications, you have to specifically clear those.                          |
| 43:26      | Like they get grouped separately to the regular shortcuts notifications, because that's the           |
| 43:30      | other thing.                                                                                          |
| 43:31      | You get a lot of notifications stacked up in your notification centre that XYZ Automation             |
| 43:35      | was run.                                                                                              |
| 43:36      | You just clear your shortcut notifications.                                                           |
| 43:37      | You can miss that an automation hasn't been running for a while unless you go looking                 |
| 43:41      | for it.                                                                                               |
| 43:42      | Yes.                                                                                                  |
| 43:43      | Bring it.                                                                                             |
| 43:44      | Bring it.                                                                                             |
| 43:45      | Let's get better and better, right?                                                                   |
| 43:46      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 43:47      | Well, I mean, if we throw enough ideas out there, hopefully somebody will find one of                 |
| 43:52      | them and be like, I reckon I can get that in and we'll have to just see what happens.                 |
| 43:55      | I feel like the whole thing with error reporting is like they don't want there to be error            |
| 43:59      | reporting because they don't want there to be error.                                                  |
| 44:01      | So it's like this struggle, this tension, right?                                                      |
| 44:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 44:05      | And I completely get that.                                                                            |
| 44:06      | And in an ideal world, that is exactly what would happen.                                             |
| 44:10      | So I've been taking some acrobatics classes recently and one of my instructors says,                  |
| 44:15      | so in Liz's Dreamland, this is how everything works.                                                  |
| 44:18      | And then she demonstrates how everything will work if you do it perfectly.                            |
| 44:22      | And then she says, and now back on planet Earth where you're all in a beginner's class,               |
| 44:26      | this is what we're going to do.                                                                       |
| 44:28      | So we know what we're aiming for, which is error free, brilliant, perfect, wonderful.                 |
| 44:33      | You dive through the hoop to do a forward roll without touching the hoop.                             |
| 44:37      | And it's like head high or whatever.                                                                  |
| 44:39      | In reality, when you start, the hoop's more lower shoulder height or the middle of the                |
| 44:45      | hoop's the shoulder height.                                                                           |
| 44:47      | And you kind of go through and you probably hit the hoop and send it flying across the                |
| 44:49      | room a couple of times because that's what happens.                                                   |
| 44:52      | The reality of it is, sometimes the actions in shortcuts don't work properly because they're          |
| 44:59      | not written by [[Apple]], they're written by a third party, and something somewhere has                   |
| 45:04      | gone very wrong or somebody left a show when run action on and it didn't work and that                |
| 45:11      | should probably default to off, actually, if we're asking for shortcuts improvements,                 |
| 45:15      | if you're using it in an automation, show when run, probably default to off, please.                  |
| 45:19      | But yeah, there's a number of reasons why stuff could go wrong.                                       |
| 45:24      | And I feel like adding better error reporting is one of those things and nobody wants to              |
| 45:28      | do this because that's kind of like emitting failure.                                                 |
| 45:31      | But a good chunk of the failure is not on the [[Apple]] or the shortcuts team.                            |
| 45:35      | It's on me, the end user sitting there, tapping stuff in on my phone and not realising that           |
| 45:39      | I haven't connected this stuff up or potentially on an app developer who's created an action          |
| 45:46      | that they never expected to be run without show when run on and then it turns out that                |
| 45:51      | it actually needs show when run because otherwise things don't work.                                  |
| 45:54      | So yeah, it would be really nice to see better error messaging and just messaging in general          |
| 46:00      | from shortcuts so that you know when stuff happened, it's grouped by automation perhaps               |
| 46:06      | instead of just shortcuts in general.                                                                 |
| 46:09      | All right, let's move on, CarPlay and Maps.                                                           |
| 46:14      | This was an interesting one because when you and I were talking about topics for wishes,              |
| 46:18      | we both seem to be gravitating towards CarPlay and Maps for automation-friendly improvements.         |
| 46:23      | Yeah, and I think it's one of those things where there's some support for automation                  |
| 46:28      | in CarPlay already.                                                                                   |
| 46:29      | So in Maps, you can add favourites as driving locations or just locations, navigation locations        |
| 46:36      | in general.                                                                                           |
| 46:37      | It's great.                                                                                           |
| 46:38      | If you tap on that in CarPlay, you can actually have, and you need to set this up on your             |
| 46:45      | iPhone to be clear, you can have your share ETA done automatically, which is great.                   |
| 46:49      | So you can have a share ETA with a particular person for a particular location.                       |
| 46:54      | So every time you navigate to that location, it sends either a text message on to an Android          |
| 47:00      | user or a Maps notification with tracking, like physical location tracking or GPS location            |
| 47:06      | tracking rather, to iOS users.                                                                        |
| 47:10      | This is great.                                                                                        |
| 47:11      | It is fabulous.                                                                                       |
| 47:12      | Thank you, Maps team.                                                                                 |
| 47:13      | I really appreciate this.                                                                             |
| 47:14      | Now please, can you make this better?                                                                 |
| 47:18      | Because I want so much more than this.                                                                |
| 47:20      | I want to be able to run a shortcut when I navigate to a favourite or better still, and                |
| 47:25      | this is something that I've been working on like noodling on and off for a while now.                 |
| 47:29      | I think I've been noodling on about this for about nine months.                                       |
| 47:33      | I want shortcuts on my CarPlay home screen.                                                           |
| 47:37      | Now this would have to be a very limited subset of actions, just like the ones that you put           |
| 47:42      | on the [[Apple Watch]].                                                                                   |
| 47:44      | But imagine if on the home screen of my CarPlay, I had a series of shortcuts, or maybe there          |
| 47:50      | was just a shortcut button which listed a limited number of shortcuts, it could just                  |
| 47:55      | do like another grid, just like the CarPlay home screen.                                              |
| 47:59      | But those ones would navigate me to a particular location and play playlists.                         |
| 48:06      | And then there's some other things that we've got on our wishlist here, which I'll let you            |
| 48:09      | have at least one of them, David.                                                                     |
| 48:11      | Yeah, no, I think it's a great idea.                                                                  |
| 48:14      | Again, it's like, can we convince them to put it on a car?                                            |
| 48:17      | Well, I don't know, right?                                                                            |
| 48:19      | Well, I think if you've got a very limited subset of actions, which are things that you               |
| 48:23      | can already do on a car, so you could only use system actions or actions from apps that               |
| 48:30      | have CarPlay integration themselves.                                                                  |
| 48:32      | So for example, if you tried to use, I'm now trying to think of an app that doesn't have              |
| 48:37      | CarPlay support, NetNewsWire, there we go, you tried to use a NetNewsWire action in CarPlay,          |
| 48:44      | that shortcut would just not be CarPlay supported at all, because NetNewsWire is not on CarPlay.      |
| 48:49      | And if I tried to use Ivory, Ivory doesn't have CarPlay support, you don't need to use                |
| 48:55      | Mastodon in your car.                                                                                 |
| 48:57      | That's fine.                                                                                          |
| 48:58      | But if I try to use overcast actions, for example, that's fine because overcast has CarPlay           |
| 49:04      | support.                                                                                              |
| 49:05      | Now, obviously, you'd have to have a further limitation of only the ones that can run entirely        |
| 49:09      | in the background without showing something and things like that, that might, that would              |
| 49:14      | be more difficult.                                                                                    |
| 49:15      | And I'll remove the word might that I technically threw in there, that would be more difficult.       |
| 49:21      | But I feel like this could be done.                                                                   |
| 49:24      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 49:25      | And honestly, it would allow us to solve problems that we have when we're driving that could          |
| 49:30      | use a shortcut.                                                                                       |
| 49:31      | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 49:32      | One of them we're talking about is turning off and on voice instructions.                             |
| 49:36      | There are times when I'm driving to someplace I don't know and I want to set the car up               |
| 49:44      | to really go full in on giving me that assistant and giving me instructions and keeping the           |
| 49:50      | biggest possible map view up.                                                                         |
| 49:52      | And that would be a great automation, like to change the view, turn on instructions,                  |
| 49:58      | turn off music, just let me focus in on driving.                                                      |
| 50:01      | Then there's other times where I'm going someplace where I know how to get there.                     |
| 50:04      | I don't really need the instructions, but I just want it running so it tells me if there's            |
| 50:08      | traffic ahead or things like that and I don't want the lady talking to me at every turn.              |
| 50:15      | And those would be two very different scenarios and a shortcut could be generated to switch           |
| 50:20      | between those modes and that would be awesome.                                                        |
| 50:23      | Yes, it really would.                                                                                 |
| 50:26      | And the other thing is as well as the maps automatic share ETA is fabulous, assuming that             |
| 50:33      | you always drive to that location to see that person.                                                 |
| 50:38      | If sometimes you drive to that location with that person, you get in the car with that                |
| 50:43      | person, you tap on the location you're driving to and they get an ETA shared with them and            |
| 50:48      | they look at you and go, why did you do that?                                                         |
| 50:51      | And you go, well, it's automatic.                                                                     |
| 50:54      | Well if I were using a shortcut and my shortcut had share ETA action, because there is no             |
| 50:59      | share ETA right now, then I could instead actually say, hey, like, and then there could               |
| 51:07      | be a menu option.                                                                                     |
| 51:09      | Would you like to share your ETA with blah, blah, blah?                                               |
| 51:12      | Yes, no.                                                                                              |
| 51:13      | And if it's yes, I put the action in there and if it's no, then I don't put the action                |
| 51:16      | in the no menu, simple.                                                                               |
| 51:21      | And similarly, there are times where I drive and there are other people in the car and                |
| 51:27      | there are times where I drive and there isn't just me in the car.                                     |
| 51:30      | When there are other people in the car, I'm probably not going to listen to a podcast,                |
| 51:33      | I'll listen to music and I don't want announce notifications on.                                      |
| 51:38      | When I'm on my own in the car, I will happily listen to a podcast and I would like announce           |
| 51:44      | notifications on so the messages from people and so on come through.                                  |
| 51:48      | But I would like to have the option of doing those two things and a shortcut that could               |
| 51:55      | run when CarPlay connects that is in CarPlay itself.                                                  |
| 52:00      | So it would pop up on the CarPlay home screen and say, hey, are you on your own?                      |
| 52:04      | Or like, do you want solo navigation is probably what I would have it ask.                            |
| 52:10      | And I can say yes, if I'm on my own or no, if I'm with other people.                                  |
| 52:13      | And that would just be very nice.                                                                     |
| 52:16      | Okay, we stretched a little bit with this next category because it's [[WWDC]].                            |
| 52:22      | But why not?                                                                                          |
| 52:23      | Right?                                                                                                |
| 52:24      | There are already automation wishes related to the [[Apple]] ecosystem.                                   |
| 52:27      | We've got a couple.                                                                                   |
| 52:28      | I mean, there's there's plenty of apps that don't have shortcut support, right?                       |
| 52:32      | And then there are the apps that have special shortcut support.                                       |
| 52:38      | And I mean special, unfortunately, in a not so great way here.                                        |
| 52:42      | When was the last time the post on Facebook action was updated?                                       |
| 52:46      | How about like Evernote, like there's Evernote stuff in here, I don't have the Evernote               |
| 52:53      | app installed.                                                                                        |
| 52:54      | But there's Evernote stuff in here that was has been there for a long time.                           |
| 53:00      | And the same with WhatsApp.                                                                           |
| 53:01      | And I understand now, you know, shortcuts is much more widely used.                                   |
| 53:05      | They can't necessarily get rid of this stuff.                                                         |
| 53:08      | But I feel like there are certain apps that have the ability to do some things already.               |
| 53:16      | That like, for example, messages from WhatsApp, you know, are linked to particular contact            |
| 53:23      | and so on.                                                                                            |
| 53:24      | And this all ties into the focus modes, like the fact that they can do that would be really           |
| 53:30      | nice to be like, OK, and so you have to have a shortcut support for this, because at the              |
| 53:35      | moment, send message to my WhatsApp, like I can select a recipient.                                   |
| 53:39      | And yeah, like it's still going to pop open WhatsApp to try and send this message.                    |
| 53:45      | And I do not understand why it needs to do this other than that's not actually a WhatsApp             |
| 53:51      | action.                                                                                               |
| 53:52      | I tell this is a shortcut section.                                                                    |
| 53:55      | So yeah, it's I would really like more integrations for things like that.                             |
| 54:01      | So all messaging apps, all of them would have the ability to send a message.                          |
| 54:06      | They do not have to be able to do it in the background, but they do have to be able to                |
| 54:09      | work in the same way that messages does on on on on the on iOS and in shortcuts.                      |
| 54:17      | And similarly, things like sharing your live location, like you can do this through, for              |
| 54:24      | example, Google Maps, you can do this through Find My, you can do this through WhatsApp,              |
| 54:30      | and I'm sure plenty of other platforms as well.                                                       |
| 54:32      | I would really love all of the apps that support that to have shortcut sections for sharing           |
| 54:38      | your location.                                                                                        |
| 54:39      | So then, you know, you can share your live location with various people automatically                 |
| 54:45      | in a relatively safe fashion, so that you can just run a shortcut.                                    |
| 54:50      | And this does tie a little bit into the car play stuff that we were talking about just                |
| 54:53      | now, because in particular, if I'm driving somebody and they're not an iOS user, and                  |
| 54:58      | I want to tell them my ETA, I'd also like to share my location with them the same way                 |
| 55:02      | that I would with Maps, not so much that I'm actually going to use Google Maps and all                |
| 55:06      | of that.                                                                                              |
| 55:07      | But at the moment, I have to get my phone out to do that, which if I'm already driving                |
| 55:12      | and I realise I've forgotten to do this, like I either have to pull over or just send them            |
| 55:17      | a text message and be like, sorry, forgot to turn on live location sharing.                           |
| 55:22      | And yeah, it'd be really nice if apps that supported things like sending messages and                 |
| 55:26      | sharing live location had shortcut action support.                                                    |
| 55:29      | And I kind of want [[Apple]] to be like, you know what?                                                   |
| 55:31      | You have to have an automation action for this now, because you can do this.                          |
| 55:36      | And then perhaps more people would know that this stuff existed as well.                              |
| 55:40      | It's definitely a way to solve the problem.                                                           |
| 55:42      | And I'm with you, you know, like, why not stretch it out a little bit.                                |
| 55:48      | I think the overarching theme here about shortcuts, it's been around a long time now, and it's        |
| 55:52      | okay to start going beyond the initial safety net, you know, you were talking about tumbling          |
| 55:59      | in gymnastics and all that, like at some point, you take the net away, right?                         |
| 56:04      | Or at least give us the ability to take the net away.                                                 |
| 56:07      | Not everybody needs to, but that would give us a lot more power.                                      |
| 56:11      | And then, you know, then the automation has become more efficient.                                    |
| 56:14      | And like you said, it brings, it's a virtuous cycle.                                                  |
| 56:17      | Yes, it really is.                                                                                    |
| 56:20      | And yeah, I think it's just one of those things where, you know, there's definitely some holdovers    |
| 56:26      | from, from, from how things used to be in shortcuts, which makes it a little trickier.                |
| 56:33      | And I have also just discovered, by the way, turns out WhatsApp has send message via WhatsApp         |
| 56:37      | send photo via WhatsApp.                                                                              |
| 56:39      | And then under messaging, there's send message, and that one actually works the way I expected        |
| 56:44      | it to.                                                                                                |
| 56:45      | Still can't share my ETA, but I'm pleased to note that that one at least is there because             |
| 56:48      | obviously WhatsApp is very popular over here in Europe.                                               |
| 56:51      | So yeah, but like the fact that there are two actions that don't work, which I'm pretty               |
| 56:55      | certain that shortcuts can't get rid of, or like, you know, WhatsApp can't get rid of                 |
| 57:00      | in shortcuts because they have to go to [[Apple]].                                                        |
| 57:02      | I feel like somebody needs to go through that old list and just have a, have an audit and             |
| 57:08      | potentially maybe just break those for, for folks, you know, I don't think there'll be                |
| 57:13      | an easy transition method for that, but fingers crossed, you know, they can, they can tidy            |
| 57:18      | this up and, and sort some of it out.                                                                 |
| 57:20      | So it's less confusing because if you and I are confused about this, David, help, I                   |
| 57:25      | hope somebody helps the new users.                                                                    |
| 57:27      | All right.                                                                                            |
| 57:29      | What about [[HomeKit]]?                                                                                   |
| 57:30      | I mean, that's the [[Apple]] automation platform that we hear a little bit about every year.              |
| 57:35      | I know that in the last year, you've become a big fan of [[Home Assistant]].                              |
| 57:40      | How much are you doing with [[HomeKit]] and what could they change to bring you back, Rose?               |
| 57:47      | Right now, [[HomeKit]], it serves for a way to manually control devices when they need manual             |
| 57:53      | control, which is rarely and it's pretty much it.                                                     |
| 57:58      | So I mean, personally, I don't think that [[Apple]] are going to bring me back just because               |
| 58:03      | the fact that I have all of the features in [[Home Assistant]] and everything set up there                |
| 58:08      | means that I'm going to have to do a lot of work to bring things back.                                |
| 58:13      | But specifically, like starting at the low end of the fruit hanging spectrum, I feel                  |
| 58:20      | like there are a number of features that [[Apple]] could add to make [[HomeKit]] more appealing               |
| 58:28      | to folks.                                                                                             |
| 58:29      | So for example, at the moment, if you create a scene, you can turn that scene off, assuming           |
| 58:36      | that the scene turns things on, so say that scene turns on a plug.                                    |
| 58:40      | You can turn a scene off after a period of time.                                                      |
| 58:43      | It's not particularly customisable, but you can turn a scene off after a period of time.              |
| 58:47      | However, you cannot turn off devices in general and you can't turn on devices full stop after         |
| 58:54      | a period of time.                                                                                     |
| 58:55      | If you want something to turn off for an hour and then turn on again, no, you just can't              |
| 58:59      | do that.                                                                                              |
| 59:00      | That's straight up just not even an option.                                                           |
| 59:02      | And I feel like that would be a very nice starting point for a lot of folks because                   |
| 59:07      | a number of people that I have asked me, hey, like there's an ice maker in my office, which           |
| 59:12      | is quite loud.                                                                                        |
| 59:13      | And I would like to turn it off when I'm on Zoom calls and have it automatically turned               |
| 59:17      | back on again after like an hour or so.                                                               |
| 59:20      | And it's like, cool, you can't do that.                                                               |
| 59:23      | You have to proxy doing that through focus modes on your iPhone.                                      |
| 59:28      | That's the way to solve that problem, which is not great.                                             |
| 59:32      | It's doable for an advanced user, very much not clear and at all in [[HomeKit]] what's happening.         |
| 59:38      | So the ability to have turning things on or off after a specific period of time would                 |
| 59:44      | be great.                                                                                             |
| 59:46      | And also extending then the wait time if you convert things to a shortcut.                            |
| 59:50      | But also just the ability to go back and look at your automations and see like, why did               |
| 59:56      | this not work?                                                                                        |
| 59:58      | Because at the moment, if a [[HomeKit]] automation doesn't work, you kind of just have to wait            |
| 01:00:03   | for the next time that something would trigger and sit and watch everything like a hawk.              |
| 01:00:07   | And why say everything?                                                                               |
| 01:00:08   | I mean, physically watch the devices manually because you're not going to get a traces really         |
| 01:00:13   | in [[HomeKit]].                                                                                           |
| 01:00:14   | You can, there's, you know, logs.                                                                     |
| 01:00:17   | There's a great app called HomeLog, which we've talked about on the show before.                      |
| 01:00:21   | And that, you know, that will definitely help if it's open and running, but it can only               |
| 01:00:26   | do so much.                                                                                           |
| 01:00:27   | And the fact that I have full traces in [[Home Assistant]] where I can see like, you know,                |
| 01:00:30   | this went down this path because of this is great.                                                    |
| 01:00:35   | So yeah, I feel like there needs to be some more options there, which would be very greatly           |
| 01:00:42   | appreciated on my behalf.                                                                             |
| 01:00:44   | What about you, David?                                                                                |
| 01:00:45   | I'm sure you've got wishes.                                                                           |
| 01:00:46   | I feel like it needs to step up a much like shortcuts does.                                           |
| 01:00:49   | And there are definite third party [[HomeKit]] related apps that have more power in them.                 |
| 01:00:55   | I would like to see that find its way into the [[HomeKit]] app itself, because in my experience           |
| 01:01:01   | almost nobody uses those third party apps except our, except our devoted fans, right?                 |
| 01:01:05   | I feel like normal people are just going to use [[Apple|Apple's]] app.                                          |
| 01:01:09   | And the only way to move the ball forward is to add multiple triggers and a few conditions            |
| 01:01:15   | and just give it another degree of complexity.                                                        |
| 01:01:19   | I know that word complexity makes people [[Apple]] nervous, but if we want a [[HomeKit]] to                   |
| 01:01:24   | really take off, I think it needs a little bit more.                                                  |
| 01:01:28   | And then the other thing, this is not automation really, but I just need it to be more consistent.    |
| 01:01:32   | I mean, just like in the last week, we've been having a thing with our front door forever.            |
| 01:01:37   | It worked.                                                                                            |
| 01:01:38   | He sat in the car, he pushed the button, he said, unlock the front door.                              |
| 01:01:40   | The door was unlocked.                                                                                |
| 01:01:41   | And for whatever reason last week, it's just not doing that.                                          |
| 01:01:45   | And I have no idea why, because there's no error reporting and no explanation of it.                  |
| 01:01:51   | And I feel like that kind of stuff needs to go away.                                                  |
| 01:01:55   | It needs to be something we can rely on.                                                              |
| 01:01:57   | But on the automation side, I just feel like they've got to start with automation, but                |
| 01:02:04   | I feel like they need to go a little bit further.                                                     |
| 01:02:07   | And the other thing is the whole idea of personal automations versus home automations.                |
| 01:02:12   | I think that's a very confusing paradigm for a lot of people.                                         |
| 01:02:16   | I mean, I get it.                                                                                     |
| 01:02:17   | I use them all the time.                                                                              |
| 01:02:19   | But when I talk to people who are not tech savvy and you have to distinguish between                  |
| 01:02:24   | a personal automation, I think you lose them.                                                         |
| 01:02:27   | And I think that's holding it back a little bit.                                                      |
| 01:02:29   | I think they should rethink the whole paradigm for creating new automations.                          |
| 01:02:34   | I think the fact that you have home automations in the Shortcuts app and the Shortcuts automations    |
| 01:02:40   | can be converted to Shortcuts, I think, honestly, just another app called [[HomeKit]] Shortcuts           |
| 01:02:50   | or something, or just advanced automations in the [[HomeKit]] app and remove the home section             |
| 01:02:58   | from the Personal Automations tab in the Shortcuts app.                                               |
| 01:03:02   | I understand why it's there.                                                                          |
| 01:03:04   | I suspect a lot of folks who came up with this idea are either the only person who does               |
| 01:03:11   | the things with their home or they are the only person in their home.                                 |
| 01:03:19   | That's fine, but it can be very, very difficult to go through and manage this stuff for somebody      |
| 01:03:27   | else.                                                                                                 |
| 01:03:28   | And on top of that, you then have, you know, like, where did this break and why?                      |
| 01:03:35   | And I understand and I like the fact that you can control [[HomeKit]] devices through a                   |
| 01:03:42   | Shortcuts section.                                                                                    |
| 01:03:45   | But I feel like there needs to be some kind of log for just general shortcuts, like this              |
| 01:03:51   | was done by this user, Shortcuts in brackets or something, just because when all of the               |
| 01:03:58   | lights in the house turn on at three o'clock in the morning, that's not the time that you             |
| 01:04:03   | want to go, huh, I guess that there's a slight problem with [[HomeKit]] at the moment.                    |
| 01:04:06   | I'll sit down and figure this out.                                                                    |
| 01:04:08   | It's three o'clock in the morning.                                                                    |
| 01:04:09   | You get woken up and you want to go back to sleep and you're cranky.                                  |
| 01:04:12   | Like worst case scenario, well, best case scenario is the [[Apple TV]] guess right now out the window     |
| 01:04:17   | or something and fingers crossed it bounces.                                                          |
| 01:04:19   | But, you know, if that happens, you're going to be cranky and it's going to be understandable         |
| 01:04:24   | and you're not going to want to debug it, you're just going to be like, no, turn off                  |
| 01:04:27   | the thing that did this, you need to know what did this.                                              |
| 01:04:30   | And that's where it gets very complicated and confusing, especially because you've got                |
| 01:04:35   | other controls happening, you know, it's not just [[HomeKit]] that's controlling your Hue                 |
| 01:04:39   | lights.                                                                                               |
| 01:04:40   | The Hue Hub has automations that can be controlling the Hue lights as well.                           |
| 01:04:44   | And where is this happening?                                                                          |
| 01:04:45   | Or did somebody do this via Siri?                                                                     |
| 01:04:48   | Or what happened in, you know, I think people, they need to know when something doesn't               |
| 01:04:53   | work as expected, what made this thing do this thing?                                                 |
| 01:04:56   | That's the thing where in a perfect world where everything was great, we don't need                   |
| 01:05:01   | error reports or error messages and shortcuts.                                                        |
| 01:05:05   | We don't need logging in [[HomeKit]].                                                                     |
| 01:05:08   | We don't live in a perfect world.                                                                     |
| 01:05:09   | Most people have got terrible home networks and also if we have problems causing weird                |
| 01:05:12   | issues, it'd be great to just have a little bit of logging so that we would know, hey,                |
| 01:05:16   | the last five things that triggered this were that simple.                                            |
| 01:05:21   | And now that I've played with [[Home Assistant]] and I've seen that, it makes me want it even             |
| 01:05:25   | more.                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:26   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:27   | But yeah, I do think that I would like to see that get better, but I also would like                  |
| 01:05:31   | to see a little bit more complexity to get added to the mix in a way that makes sense.                |
| 01:05:35   | And the way the app was made, I get it, but I feel like it's time to rethink some of that             |
| 01:05:41   | stuff.                                                                                                |
| 01:05:42   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:05:43   | And it is very tricky at times.                                                                       |
| 01:05:45   | And I don't blame anybody for going, okay, this is what we're going to do here.                       |
| 01:05:53   | We're going to limit it like this.                                                                    |
| 01:05:54   | That's fine.                                                                                          |
| 01:05:55   | We'll definitely get it.                                                                              |
| 01:05:56   | But at the same time, it is at the point where there are enough users who are running into            |
| 01:06:03   | walls with things where they need the ability to turn off this device's ability to run as             |
| 01:06:09   | a [[HomeKit]] Hub.                                                                                        |
| 01:06:10   | Because for whatever reason, that HomePod Mini in that bedroom, even though theoretically             |
| 01:06:15   | it should be fine, when that one becomes the Hub, the [[HomeKit]] Hub, everything kind of                 |
| 01:06:21   | goes wonky and sideways.                                                                              |
| 01:06:23   | I was reading about that on Reddit earlier today.                                                     |
| 01:06:25   | Everybody has one [[HomeKit]] Hub where usually about 10% to 20% of devices go unresponsive               |
| 01:06:31   | when that HomePod Mini becomes the [[HomeKit]] Hub.                                                       |
| 01:06:34   | Unlike the last time, I think it was 100 out of 120 devices became unresponsive.                      |
| 01:06:40   | That's a lot of devices to just have disappear and not work.                                          |
| 01:06:46   | So yeah, I can understand why people need more of this.                                               |
| 01:06:52   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:06:53   | I was just thinking too, also, though, in terms of stability, the focus on stability                  |
| 01:06:57   | really should be towards smaller shortcuts.                                                           |
| 01:07:00   | I mean, really shortcuts exist for the two to five or 10, but we're running into some                 |
| 01:07:08   | stability issues with those small ones.                                                               |
| 01:07:11   | That's not a good sign.                                                                               |
| 01:07:12   | That's not a good look for shortcuts.                                                                 |
| 01:07:14   | Exactly.                                                                                              |
| 01:07:15   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:07:16   | I mean, I love the fact that we can do more advanced things with shortcuts through [[HomeKit]].           |
| 01:07:22   | That's great.                                                                                         |
| 01:07:23   | I don't want that to go away, but I think it is confusing for users, especially considering           |
| 01:07:27   | the limited subset of actions available within the shortcuts actions itself inside of [[HomeKit]]         |
| 01:07:33   | that it would be worth splitting them so that they're only available in the [[HomeKit]] app.              |
| 01:07:36   | Because at the moment, a number of times I get a question for Ask iOS Today or we get                 |
| 01:07:44   | it here on Automated.                                                                                 |
| 01:07:45   | Why can't I send a message from a [[HomeKit]] action?                                                     |
| 01:07:49   | I don't see that action.                                                                              |
| 01:07:50   | It's not there.                                                                                       |
| 01:07:51   | I have to create a personal automation instead.                                                       |
| 01:07:52   | Well, it's the difference between a personal automation that runs at 3pm and a [[HomeKit]]                |
| 01:07:55   | action that runs at 3pm.                                                                              |
| 01:07:58   | The fact that those kind of come under the same umbrella, but it's more the light in                  |
| 01:08:02   | the dark side of the moon, it's confusing for users.                                                  |
| 01:08:07   | Okay.                                                                                                 |
| 01:08:08   | So now we're going to expand our wishing into hardware and just [[WWDC]] in general.                      |
| 01:08:14   | This is our last chance to talk before it happens.                                                    |
| 01:08:17   | What are you looking forward to, Rose?                                                                |
| 01:08:19   | Well, I mean, so we got a Purple iPhone Pro this year.                                                |
| 01:08:23   | I love it.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:24   | It's amazing.                                                                                         |
| 01:08:25   | [[Apple]], please, please, please, please, please make Purple part of the standard lineup for             |
| 01:08:29   | Pro devices everywhere.                                                                               |
| 01:08:31   | I'll buy a new Mac Studio.                                                                            |
| 01:08:32   | I'll buy a new iPad Pro.                                                                              |
| 01:08:34   | I'll buy a new iPhone.                                                                                |
| 01:08:35   | I'll buy a new [[Apple Watch#Apple Watch Ultra\|Apple Watch Ultra]].                                                                     |
| 01:08:36   | If you give me a Purple button on it, please.                                                         |
| 01:08:38   | Like the Purple is gorgeous.                                                                          |
| 01:08:40   | I love it.                                                                                            |
| 01:08:41   | I hope it stays.                                                                                      |
| 01:08:42   | But I would love to see, you know, coloured Pro iPads.                                                 |
| 01:08:46   | I kind of understand why there isn't, there's silver in the eternally changing space gray.            |
| 01:08:51   | But, you know, they do pretty colours of Pro iPhones, at least could they do pretty colours             |
| 01:08:57   | of Pro iPads?                                                                                         |
| 01:08:58   | That would be pretty nice as well.                                                                    |
| 01:09:01   | Yeah, I don't know.                                                                                   |
| 01:09:02   | I mean, I feel like on the hardware side of it, I feel like the big story is going to                 |
| 01:09:07   | be the 15-inch MacBook Air, which seems more and more likely that we're going to get it               |
| 01:09:13   | and then the goggle announcement, the headsets.                                                       |
| 01:09:16   | I don't know what they're going to call them.                                                         |
| 01:09:17   | But I feel like that's going to be the big announcements on hardware.                                 |
| 01:09:21   | But we'll see, you know, what do you think of the headset?                                            |
| 01:09:25   | I mean, assuming that the rumors are more or less true, that it's going to be a strap                 |
| 01:09:30   | on virtual reality headset that could have AR capabilities with cameras on the front.                 |
| 01:09:36   | Do you have any interest in that?                                                                     |
| 01:09:39   | And I'll just start there.                                                                            |
| 01:09:40   | What's your interest level?                                                                           |
| 01:09:42   | I mean, definitely interested as like a concept, sure.                                                |
| 01:09:47   | I have an Oculus Quest and I love playing Beat Saber on it.                                           |
| 01:09:51   | It's basically a Beat Saber machine, to be honest.                                                    |
| 01:09:54   | I don't really play many other games on it, but it is quite nice for a quick workout.                 |
| 01:10:00   | But yeah, like I'm curious, but I feel like VR struggles really in a number of places                 |
| 01:10:12   | A, it's expensive.                                                                                    |
| 01:10:14   | Obviously, people buying [[Apple]] devices do tend to be on the higher side of disposable                 |
| 01:10:19   | income, but that doesn't mean that everybody's got that.                                              |
| 01:10:21   | I know plenty of people who are using multiple year old iPhones.                                      |
| 01:10:26   | And the other thing, which I think is going to be more of a problem for folks, is physical            |
| 01:10:31   | space requirements.                                                                                   |
| 01:10:33   | I know in the US, you know, outside of major cities, you know, like San Francisco and New             |
| 01:10:39   | York and so on.                                                                                       |
| 01:10:41   | Folks tend to have more space in their homes.                                                         |
| 01:10:44   | They tend to have larger homes.                                                                       |
| 01:10:47   | Outside the US, not so much a thing, especially here in the UK, you know, I live in a fairly          |
| 01:10:53   | average flat, a small apartment.                                                                      |
| 01:10:57   | And my rooms are not that big, especially because I have the single furniture in them                 |
| 01:11:01   | and I can't just get rid of my bed to make space to use a VR headset.                                 |
| 01:11:07   | So I have to be fairly careful about things like that already.                                        |
| 01:11:11   | And I think that there will be more people who would love to use this sort of thing,                  |
| 01:11:15   | but just don't want to rearrange their living space or can't rearrange their living space             |
| 01:11:20   | to accommodate something like that, which will make it tricky.                                        |
| 01:11:24   | But at the same time, I'm still very intrigued to see what they do on the AR side of things,          |
| 01:11:28   | because I think that could be incredibly useful.                                                      |
| 01:11:31   | Yeah, like you, I'm really interested to see what the story is about it because it needs              |
| 01:11:35   | to be more than just a gaming machine.                                                                |
| 01:11:38   | And the rumors are that it's going to be expensive, but have high end hardware.                       |
| 01:11:42   | And does the high end hardware give it more capability in terms of productivity?                      |
| 01:11:48   | And that's the story I'm really interested in to see.                                                 |
| 01:11:52   | Will I buy one?                                                                                       |
| 01:11:53   | I think it's probably likely.                                                                         |
| 01:11:54   | I can't afford it right now.                                                                          |
| 01:11:55   | I got a kid in college and all that, but I can't help myself.                                         |
| 01:11:59   | I'm not going to lie.                                                                                 |
| 01:12:00   | I'll have to be really turned off to not get one.                                                     |
| 01:12:04   | But yeah.                                                                                             |
| 01:12:05   | But we'll see what they do and what it looks like.                                                    |
| 01:12:08   | And if they do make them and I like it, I'll be reporting in for you gang on automation               |
| 01:12:12   | in a headset, which will probably be how do I not bang into a wall while I'm walking around           |
| 01:12:17   | with it on.                                                                                           |
| 01:12:18   | But we'll see.                                                                                        |
| 01:12:19   | But I'm very curious about that.                                                                      |
| 01:12:23   | The bigger MacBook Air, I think is a nice addition.                                                   |
| 01:12:27   | I think it's not going to be the most popular, but it's going to be one that a lot of people          |
| 01:12:31   | want.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:32   | I think that's going to be great.                                                                     |
| 01:12:35   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:12:36   | I mean, just thinking actually on the headset front, the product that I'd actually really             |
| 01:12:40   | like as far as AR goes is more like a Google Glass than a regular headset that blocks everything      |
| 01:12:47   | out.                                                                                                  |
| 01:12:48   | Because it would be great if, as I was wandering around through the day, I could have my task         |
| 01:12:53   | list appear on the edge of the field of my vision and then just kind of look over at                  |
| 01:13:00   | it, pick a task and be like, okay, this is the thing that I need like scrolling across                |
| 01:13:04   | the bottom of my life right now so that I don't forget what I'm doing.                                |
| 01:13:08   | Maybe this is just my ADHD talking.                                                                   |
| 01:13:09   | I do get distracted from things every once in a while.                                                |
| 01:13:12   | But that's the sort of thing where I could see that being incredibly useful.                          |
| 01:13:16   | Do not lose track of the thing that you are currently doing.                                          |
| 01:13:19   | This is the thing that you're currently doing.                                                        |
| 01:13:20   | Of course, you give me a post-it note and you've given me a pretty sticky decoration                  |
| 01:13:25   | after about 10 minutes.                                                                               |
| 01:13:27   | I'm sure I've become immune to it in no time, but I don't know, maybe that could work, but            |
| 01:13:34   | we'll have to see.                                                                                    |
| 01:13:35   | Are we going to get automation in that perspective?                                                   |
| 01:13:37   | From an automation perspective, I'm hoping that when the iPhone comes out, we're going                |
| 01:13:42   | to get a silent mode button rather than a switch because then we could have shortcut                  |
| 01:13:47   | support for silent mode.                                                                              |
| 01:13:49   | And that would be really cool.                                                                        |
| 01:13:50   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:13:51   | I mean, just a programmable button on the iPhone would be awesome.                                    |
| 01:13:54   | I don't think we're going to hear about that until September.                                         |
| 01:13:56   | No, I don't think so either, but at the same time, this is our wishes for the next couple             |
| 01:14:02   | of months and we'll see what happens.                                                                 |
| 01:14:04   | On the headset, I guess I have one more additional point to make is that I remember when [[Apple]]        |
| 01:14:09   | was working on a phone and when they were kind of a tablet.                                           |
| 01:14:13   | And particularly with respect to the phone, we all had a preconceived notion of what a                |
| 01:14:18   | smartphone was and what they announced was something completely different.                            |
| 01:14:23   | And I would hope that that's what we get with this headset, that we're thinking about something       |
| 01:14:29   | to play Beat Saber on, but what they give us instead does way more than that and has                  |
| 01:14:34   | got a lot of tech in it that makes it so much more valuable to us than a Beat Saber machine.          |
| 01:14:41   | And that's the part I'm looking forward to.                                                           |
| 01:14:43   | You never know if they can do it or not.                                                              |
| 01:14:45   | This is not an easy ask, but if they really want to nail this, that's the kind of keynote             |
| 01:14:52   | I'd like to see is like, oh my goodness, I can't believe that I never thought of that.                |
| 01:14:56   | This will be great.                                                                                   |
| 01:14:57   | That kind of thing.                                                                                   |
| 01:14:58   | And sometimes they say that and that's not so much and sometimes they say it and it's                 |
| 01:15:05   | true.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:06   | And I would like this to be that version of it.                                                       |
| 01:15:09   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:10   | I think it would be good to see [[Apple Arcade]] support for this as well just because or just            |
| 01:15:16   | game support as well rather than just purely VR AR and so on, just because I think that               |
| 01:15:22   | there will be a lot of people who'd be like, but I want to play Beat Saber.                           |
| 01:15:25   | Oh, no, I agree.                                                                                      |
| 01:15:26   | There has to be a gaming element of it, but there has to be more too.                                 |
| 01:15:30   | Yeah.                                                                                                 |
| 01:15:31   | You can't ignore gaming with an AR headset or VR headset.                                             |
| 01:15:34   | It's just, it's got to be there.                                                                      |
| 01:15:36   | I agree.                                                                                              |
| 01:15:38   | In terms of software, we had a lot of fun talking about today through the show, but you know,         |
| 01:15:43   | [[Apple]] doesn't leak very much, you know, when it comes to software, all that stuff is done             |
| 01:15:46   | in Cupertino, those people know how to keep secrets.                                                  |
| 01:15:50   | It's the manufacturing stuff that you don't, you know, the leaks on.                                  |
| 01:15:54   | So I don't think there's a whole lot of rumors out about what's going to change with the software     |
| 01:15:59   | that's credible at this point.                                                                        |
| 01:16:02   | We did hear at one point that this was supposed to be more of a snow leopard year in the sense        |
| 01:16:07   | of a lot of bug fixes, but, but then there's also a list of things like that.                         |
| 01:16:12   | There are rumors that focus mode is going to get improved features, but we don't know                 |
| 01:16:16   | what that means.                                                                                      |
| 01:16:17   | Any of the rumors that have surfaced particularly stand out for you on the software side?             |
| 01:16:23   | I don't think so, no.                                                                                 |
| 01:16:25   | I mean, it's one of those things where, yeah, like the [[Apple]] or I think getting a little              |
| 01:16:30   | better about keeping, keeping the leaks in and I'm also getting a little bit better about             |
| 01:16:34   | not reading them.                                                                                     |
| 01:16:36   | And you know, we're, we're very close to release as, as this episode comes out.                       |
| 01:16:42   | So I'm sure more things will have appeared between recording and release, but yeah, there's           |
| 01:16:49   | nothing that really stands out yet, which is one of the things where I'm both nervous                 |
| 01:16:54   | and I'm excited because, you know, who knows, like they, there, there is something that               |
| 01:17:00   | looks like it'll be sort of like mood tracking and so on.                                             |
| 01:17:03   | And also the accessibility features that were pre announced with, you know, shortcuts                 |
| 01:17:09   | support for doing like journalling and notes and things like that.                                     |
| 01:17:15   | That is really exciting.                                                                              |
| 01:17:16   | And I'm looking forward to seeing more things like that come out as well.                             |
| 01:17:19   | All right.                                                                                            |
| 01:17:20   | Well, we are the automators.                                                                          |
| 01:17:22   | You can find us at relay.fm/automators.                                                         |
| 01:17:25   | It's fun talking about this stuff where I can't wait to have the event go down and we can             |
| 01:17:30   | report back as to what we did and did not get.                                                        |
| 01:17:34   | We will of course be checking in on it.                                                               |
| 01:17:36   | Rose and I can't help ourselves will be installing betas and trying out these new automation features |
| 01:17:40   | for you once we have something to report.                                                             |
| 01:17:43   | Thanks to our sponsors this week, TextExpander from Smile.                                           |

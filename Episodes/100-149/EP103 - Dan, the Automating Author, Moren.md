| 00:00      | Hello, and welcome to Automatorss, the automation podcast about making computers do all of the         |
| 00:07      | things for you, at least, you know, most of the time when they behave.                                 |
| 00:11      | I'm Rosemary Orchard, and I'm joined as always by David Sparks.                                        |
| 00:14      | Hey, David, how are you?                                                                               |
| 00:15      | I am great, Rose.                                                                                      |
| 00:17      | I am, you know, automating today.                                                                      |
| 00:19      | We've got a guest on.                                                                                  |
| 00:20      | This is going to be a fun show.                                                                        |
| 00:23      | Yeah, yeah, it is.                                                                                     |
| 00:25      | Welcome to the show, Dan Moran.                                                                        |
| 00:27      | Hello, it's so nice to be here with both of you.                                                       |
| 00:30      | Before we get started, I just wanted to share a couple announcements.                                  |
| 00:34      | I just released the shortcuts for Mac Field Guide.                                                     |
| 00:37      | Automators may be interested in that.                                                                  |
| 00:39      | It's got a, it's eight hours, 134 videos or so, and just a lot of training on how to                   |
| 00:46      | do shortcuts on your Mac.                                                                              |
| 00:47      | This one was quite a journey, frankly, you know, shortcuts didn't start out so great                   |
| 00:54      | on the Mac, but they really kind of picked up steam towards the end, and we got a great                |
| 00:58      | field guide out of it.                                                                                 |
| 00:59      | If you guys are interested, head over to [learn.macsparky.com](https://learn.macsparky.com), you can get it there.                    |
| 01:04      | There is a 10% discount, which you can get for now for a short time.                                   |
| 01:09      | There's two versions.                                                                                  |
| 01:10      | The main version is just, you know, the field guide with the eight hours and 134 videos,               |
| 01:15      | but there's a plus version.                                                                            |
| 01:16      | The first time I've ever done that, where you can also get it with a webinar series.                   |
| 01:21      | We're going to do a webinar series on shortcuts.                                                       |
| 01:23      | So that's just a little thing I did.                                                                   |
| 01:26      | Please go check it out.                                                                                |
| 01:27      | Well, speaking of taking things up to the next level, Dan, welcome to the show, of course,             |
| 01:32      | first of all, and, you know, I'm curious, you know, I've known about you for what feels                |
| 01:38      | like quite a long time, you know, just through really, and so on, we've podcasted together             |
| 01:41      | on clockwise and so on.                                                                                |
| 01:44      | And I get the impression that you probably have quite a bit of, you know, history with                 |
| 01:49      | tech, obviously, and a lot more going on with automation in your life than one might                   |
| 01:53      | think at a casual glance.                                                                              |
| 01:57      | That's probably true.                                                                                  |
| 01:58      | I mean, my tech history certainly goes back quite a ways.                                              |
| 02:03      | I guess my earliest automation history is probably like trying to figure out how to program            |
| 02:07      | my VCR back in the late 1980s, probably the tape Star Trek off our local TV channel.                   |
| 02:16      | And I mean, you know, I've had a Mac since 1990, and I have messed around with a lot                   |
| 02:22      | of different automation and programming aspects on the Mac over that period.                           |
| 02:27      | In the earliest days, that was like playing around with the innards of apps via ResEdit                |
| 02:33      | or doing a little bit of learning tinkering with tools like [[HyperCard]].                                 |
| 02:40      | And so I, you know, automation has always been a tricky area for me because it's something             |
| 02:47      | that I am very interested in because I love the idea of doing less work.                               |
| 02:52      | Everybody likes that.                                                                                  |
| 02:53      | Everybody likes doing less work.                                                                       |
| 02:55      | And I enjoy getting down as the weeds on sort of programming and tinkering with these kind             |
| 02:59      | of things.                                                                                             |
| 03:00      | But at the same time, I have often found myself frustrated by the resources available.                 |
| 03:06      | Because I mean, I remember in the very earliest days, you know, if you wanted to script anything       |
| 03:10      | on the Mac, you're doing [[AppleScript]].                                                                 |
| 03:12      | And AppleScript was something that I always struggled with.                                           |
| 03:14      | I never quite understood how to make it do the things that I wanted it to do and always                |
| 03:20      | seemed a bit arcane.                                                                                   |
| 03:21      | And I sort of knew there was all this stuff that you could do.                                         |
| 03:24      | But I just, I had so much trouble wrapping my head around it that I think it wasn't                    |
| 03:28      | until I started learning like programming languages later.                                             |
| 03:31      | For some reason, even those, you know, ended up being more accessible to me than Apple                 |
| 03:35      | script.                                                                                                |
| 03:36      | In my earliest days, you know, learning basic and even hyper talk, like, I could get my,               |
| 03:41      | I can understand what I was doing there, whereas with AppleScript, it felt like it should             |
| 03:45      | be something I could easily, oh yeah, just do this thing and it does this, but it never                |
| 03:50      | seemed to quite work for me.                                                                           |
| 03:51      | So I struggle with that.                                                                               |
| 03:52      | I think the challenge with AppleScript is that, you know, they, they really wanted it                 |
| 03:56      | to be more accessible to non programmers.                                                              |
| 03:59      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:00      | So it's got a certain fuzziness to it that you really have to get used to.                             |
| 04:05      | And like if you are a more traditional programmer and you know how to declare a variable and           |
| 04:11      | do certain things and it always works the same way, but you always do it exactly the                   |
| 04:15      | same way, a language that is, you know, more that is fuzzier like AppleScript, it can                 |
| 04:22      | be vexing.                                                                                             |
| 04:23      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:24      | And I think part of the challenge for me, especially as someone who also does a lot of writing         |
| 04:28      | is the AppleScript always purports to be this like written in English style programming               |
| 04:33      | language, right?                                                                                       |
| 04:34      | And, but it doesn't look like English and it doesn't look like programming and I always                |
| 04:38      | just was like super confused.                                                                          |
| 04:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 04:41      | I get it, man.                                                                                         |
| 04:42      | I think a lot of people struggle with that, which is a, I think one of the reasons Apple               |
| 04:45      | has gone so hard on shortcuts is they want something that, you know, people can do without             |
| 04:50      | having to decipher AppleScript.                                                                       |
| 04:53      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 04:54      | And then in the meantime, in like the interim there, we had Automator, right on the, on                |
| 04:57      | the Mac.                                                                                               |
| 04:58      | And that was another great example of every single time I was like, I should be able to                |
| 05:02      | automate this.                                                                                         |
| 05:03      | And I would open Automator and I would spend half an hour trying to do something and just              |
| 05:07      | get frustrated and then quit Automator because it was like, it takes me more time in this              |
| 05:13      | moment to automate the thing that I was going to do than to do the thing.                              |
| 05:17      | And I know that I might save time in the long run if I can automate it, but it's just too,             |
| 05:21      | it's too hard.                                                                                         |
| 05:22      | It's too hard.                                                                                         |
| 05:23      | It's like inserting a date in, into a file name in, in Automator, like it's a hard coded               |
| 05:28      | date.                                                                                                  |
| 05:29      | Like you select a date from a date picker and then it stays like that.                                 |
| 05:31      | It's not like a dynamic thing and, and, and stuff like that.                                           |
| 05:34      | I, I found it very frustrating and similarly, you know, with AppleScript, like you can                |
| 05:40      | say like with records from shortcuts or for each, but you don't use for each to go through             |
| 05:48      | it.                                                                                                    |
| 05:49      | It's like repeat with shortcut in folder from shortcuts or something like that.                        |
| 05:54      | And yeah.                                                                                              |
| 05:55      | And they've got so many aliases as well for things, which, you know, like get this within              |
| 06:00      | that or, you know, with, you know, while and quit.                                                     |
| 06:04      | It's quite seemed like when I was like trying to chain those blocks together, like you can             |
| 06:07      | see the, the DNA of shortcuts in Automator, but shortcuts does it just so much better.                 |
| 06:14      | And so, you know, trying to struggle through Automator and figure out like, okay, where                |
| 06:18      | does this, what, what, what information is this passing to the next action in the chain                |
| 06:21      | and how do I get to do this, but how do I get these file that want to manipulate these                 |
| 06:24      | things.                                                                                                |
| 06:25      | And it was just, you know, it frustrated me so much that I just never really, I did some               |
| 06:30      | super basic stuff and then I would kind of give up and not try to do anything really complex.          |
| 06:36      | I honestly think a large portion of the automation stuff I've done, especially in recent years         |
| 06:41      | has been via the web, like web-based tools.                                                            |
| 06:45      | And that is, I think something that makes a lot of sense for me because it's one of                    |
| 06:49      | those cases where it's like, well, I have this data over here and I have, want to perform              |
| 06:53      | these actions on it and I want to like, you know, do a really complex thing and I know                 |
| 06:58      | I have all these services available to me that can do these things.                                    |
| 07:01      | So, you know, for example, I wrote a post, oh, I want to say maybe, I think it was last                |
| 07:07      | year, the end of last December, 2021 there.                                                            |
| 07:11      | I do a yearly puzzle competition at MIT called the mystery, MIT Mystery Hunt.                          |
| 07:17      | And I've been part of a team doing that for over a decade now.                                         |
| 07:22      | And one of the things that I sort of set myself to do a few years back was redo some of our            |
| 07:26      | behind-the-scenes like tools because we had these giant Google spreadsheets where we'd                 |
| 07:31      | store information and we wanted to be able to like have, you know, [[Slack]] channels to                   |
| 07:36      | work on things and Google documents spawned every time there was a new puzzle we wanted                |
| 07:40      | to work on.                                                                                            |
| 07:41      | And we had a system to do it, but it was a little clunky and I discovered a service                    |
| 07:45      | called Integromat and I just sort of dove into that and it was like so perfect for what                |
| 07:51      | I need to do.                                                                                          |
| 07:52      | And it was this exceedingly complex workflow where it like spins off and now spins off                 |
| 07:56      | like [[Discord]] channels and Google Docs and files the Google Docs in the correct areas                   |
| 08:00      | and like can manage channels and take and you can sort of solve puzzles with a separate                |
| 08:03      | workflow that then archives channels and marks things as solved and all this.                          |
| 08:08      | And it was just, oh, yeah, like this is this is what I need.                                           |
| 08:11      | This is the thing that is like totally scratching my automation edge.                                  |
| 08:14      | Oh, yeah.                                                                                              |
| 08:15      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:16      | I really love Integromat.                                                                              |
| 08:17      | They recently renamed to make.                                                                         |
| 08:18      | Make?                                                                                                  |
| 08:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:20      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:21      | I really like Integromat as well.                                                                      |
| 08:22      | And I have to say, I really like the visual aspect of it as well.                                      |
| 08:24      | It works so nicely.                                                                                    |
| 08:25      | And the fact that you've got the the branches and everything in there, it makes it feels               |
| 08:29      | like it's quite easy to understand what's going on as well.                                            |
| 08:32      | If you watch a flow, I quite like when I'm testing something, watching it and then watching            |
| 08:36      | it like iterate over like 10 different things where it just like loop service or something             |
| 08:40      | is like one, two, three.                                                                               |
| 08:41      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 08:42      | It's very satisfying.                                                                                  |
| 08:43      | Having come at that from things like, you know, IFTTT and Zapier, both of which are kind               |
| 08:48      | of operate on a similar principle, but IFTTT was always very limited.                                  |
| 08:52      | It's really just like, this thing happens, do this, like that's it.                                    |
| 08:55      | And Zapier was more complex, but I think to your point about the UI is not as easy to                  |
| 09:01      | rock.                                                                                                  |
| 09:02      | It is a far weirder UI and it's just harder to figure out.                                             |
| 09:06      | It's top down, right?                                                                                  |
| 09:07      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 09:08      | It goes from the top to the bottom of your screen and you don't have the option to move                |
| 09:12      | things around and so on.                                                                               |
| 09:14      | So if you put something, you can add something, I think, between two actions inside of a Zap,          |
| 09:19      | but you can't, I don't think you can rearrange things so you can't say, oh right, this thing           |
| 09:23      | that was down here, actually I need to move that six actions up, which is one of those                 |
| 09:30      | things that I struggled with and I found with Make, you can sort of just like break the                |
| 09:35      | connections between things and then move it around.                                                    |
| 09:38      | It's a little bit like [[Audio Hijack]], basically, right?                                                 |
| 09:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 09:41      | Like it's got that same sort of like modular flow to it.                                               |
| 09:43      | Now, as we're talking about this, I'm like, oh, that'd be great for shortcuts.                         |
| 09:46      | They should do that.                                                                                   |
| 09:47      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 09:48      | I mean, I have to say that is one of the things where I do wish that, like, I have a 12.9              |
| 09:53      | inch iPad Pro and I'll appreciate not everyone has one of those, but anybody that's got a              |
| 09:57      | Mac running Mac OS Monterey has got at least a 13 inch screen available.                               |
| 10:02      | And shortcuts has the same kind of thing, right?                                                       |
| 10:04      | It's top down.                                                                                         |
| 10:05      | You start at the top and you work your way down, which is a very logical thing to do,                  |
| 10:10      | but I kind of feel like maybe a left to right and then branching things out and being able             |
| 10:15      | to see this goes to here and that goes to there and can it do both of those in parallel?               |
| 10:21      | Yes, it can or no, I've added a filter in here to stop it doing that.                                  |
| 10:25      | That could be very useful.                                                                             |
| 10:27      | And I wonder if, you know, because I find I think a lot of people have discovered shortcuts            |
| 10:31      | over the last, you know, couple of years, obviously with Apple buying them and shipping                |
| 10:34      | it, you know, built into every iPhone.                                                                 |
| 10:37      | But I think more people would be inclined to play with it if it looked a bit more like                 |
| 10:41      | a game.                                                                                                |
| 10:42      | And I find like Mac looks a bit more like a game than, than Zapier does, for example.                 |
| 10:47      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 10:48      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 10:49      | No, I think that would be super cool because it is one of the things that you struggle with            |
| 10:51      | a lot in shortcuts.                                                                                    |
| 10:52      | It's like, oh, no, I need to move this section.                                                        |
| 10:53      | And it's like, all right, so you can sort of drag stuff.                                               |
| 10:56      | But if you got a small screen, you got to like drag it with one hand and scroll up and                 |
| 11:00      | not overshoot.                                                                                         |
| 11:01      | And then if you got dragging multiple blocks at the same time, because it's all like nested,           |
| 11:05      | it sometimes gets a little slow or cumbersome and yeah, it's, it's, it's great for what                |
| 11:09      | it is.                                                                                                 |
| 11:10      | It has done an amazing job of introducing more and more people to automation and making                |
| 11:14      | automation possible on iOS.                                                                            |
| 11:17      | But it doesn't mean that we should stop there.                                                         |
| 11:19      | And I would love, I think that would be super cool if they decided to go to a more modular             |
| 11:22      | design at some point.                                                                                  |
| 11:23      | It's funny how all this kind of ties together.                                                         |
| 11:25      | I mean, we started talking about automator, which is really the, the, the, the predecessor             |
| 11:31      | of shortcuts.                                                                                          |
| 11:32      | I mean, if you look historically, the people that made workflow, which became shortcuts,               |
| 11:38      | they were attracted to automator.                                                                      |
| 11:41      | And the problem with automator wasn't that the people that made it were, were enthusiastic             |
| 11:45      | about it.                                                                                              |
| 11:46      | It was just, I think upper management at Apple never gave it, you know, sufficient resources           |
| 11:51      | to become as good as it could have been.                                                               |
| 11:53      | I mean, they, they announced automator with so much fanfare, but they never did much with              |
| 11:58      | it afterwards.                                                                                         |
| 11:59      | And, you know, from everything we've heard Sal was running behind the scenes, you know,                |
| 12:03      | with his, you know, you know, trying to get people to adopt it even inside the company                 |
| 12:09      | with their apps.                                                                                       |
| 12:10      | And it just never got that traction.                                                                   |
| 12:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:13      | It's very, very Apple-like move to announce something with a big announcement and then                 |
| 12:17      | kind of quietly just let it die.                                                                       |
| 12:19      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:20      | I think upper management, there were some people that were management that just weren't interested     |
| 12:23      | in automation.                                                                                         |
| 12:24      | And that's my outside take, you know, I mean, I think Steve Jobs got it.                               |
| 12:29      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 12:30      | Because automation is what kept Apple afloat, you know, it was all the automation stuff they           |
| 12:34      | had in the nineties that kept publishers buying Macs and probably kept the company from going          |
| 12:39      | under.                                                                                                 |
| 12:40      | But, you know, times change, right?                                                                    |
| 12:42      | And I think that, you know, it had to come from outside, but at the same time, when you                |
| 12:48      | see the, the people making workflow being drawn in with the idea of automator, of course,              |
| 12:52      | they're going to make the same vertical layout.                                                        |
| 12:54      | Sure.                                                                                                  |
| 12:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 12:57      | You know, the, the friendliness of shortcuts in the way, not only how it's laid out and                |
| 13:01      | everything, but like, you know, we talked about the visual appeal and like those big                   |
| 13:04      | colourful blocks.                                                                                       |
| 13:05      | I think, honestly, it's a little thing, but it makes a big difference because it feels                 |
| 13:08      | approachable in a way that automator did not.                                                          |
| 13:12      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 13:14      | And the way that the widgets kind of blend into your home screen as well, you know, if                 |
| 13:17      | you've got like a one action widget, it's just a big colourful blob.                                    |
| 13:20      | But similarly, most other widgets are quite similar, especially the little two by two                  |
| 13:25      | one.                                                                                                   |
| 13:26      | There's just one action with a little icon and some text on it, but it, it does exactly                |
| 13:30      | what you need.                                                                                         |
| 13:31      | Though I am slightly concerned because if you have a look at it, like, you know, Microsoft             |
| 13:36      | Word and off the office suite for ages had the best automator actions for doing stuff.                 |
| 13:40      | You could convert like a Word document to a PDF and so on, but that wasn't something                   |
| 13:43      | you could do with pages.                                                                               |
| 13:45      | No, not really.                                                                                        |
| 13:47      | And we've kind of seen to a lesser extent, because fortunately, the iWork team are on                  |
| 13:52      | it and they've, they've shipped a whole bunch of actions for shortcuts and including a recent          |
| 13:56      | update where they've added a whole bunch extra stuff on the Mac, which was really nice.                |
| 14:02      | But like, there isn't a lot of buy in from, say, the meal app inside of shortcuts.                     |
| 14:07      | And it would be really nice to see, you know, those other teams at Apple, you know, step               |
| 14:11      | up to the plate or give the shortcuts team access to whatever it is they need to do                    |
| 14:14      | to be able to do more.                                                                                 |
| 14:16      | I don't just want to send an email.                                                                    |
| 14:17      | I want to be able to get my emails and find the ones that were sent by me within the last              |
| 14:23      | week from the specific email account so that I can just have an overview of like how much              |
| 14:26      | time did I spend actually sending email last week.                                                     |
| 14:29      | Or even open a targeted mailbox, like open up my feedback folder.                                      |
| 14:33      | I mean, yeah, and not rely on you having opened it 20,000 times to try and get that shortcut           |
| 14:39      | action to show up.                                                                                     |
| 14:40      | Yeah, which, by the way, isn't consistent even when you use it.                                        |
| 14:44      | It should be like a UUID kind of situation where you're like, yeah, this folder becomes                |
| 14:48      | a target and you open it.                                                                              |
| 14:50      | It's that simple.                                                                                      |
| 14:51      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:52      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 14:53      | I think it's fascinating too.                                                                          |
| 14:54      | I mean, you talked to David about upper management and stuff like that, like, you know, who owns       |
| 15:00      | the shortcuts for the apps?                                                                            |
| 15:01      | I mean, [[Federico Viticci]] obviously mentioned this kind of stuff before, but like, you know,           |
| 15:05      | they roll out new features at [[WWDC]] and shortcuts rolls out new features.                                |
| 15:10      | And it's like, well, is it the people on the apps who work on those apps that are responsible          |
| 15:14      | for like making it work with shortcuts?                                                                |
| 15:16      | Or is it the shortcuts team has to go to all those app people and be like, please, let's               |
| 15:20      | do this thing because, you know, new features come out.                                                |
| 15:23      | I think of, I was trying to automate something and I wanted to do an automation related to             |
| 15:28      | tab groups in [[Safari]].                                                                                  |
| 15:29      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 15:30      | There's nothing there.                                                                                 |
| 15:31      | You can't do anything with tab groups.                                                                 |
| 15:33      | It doesn't even know a tab group exists.                                                               |
| 15:35      | Right?                                                                                                 |
| 15:36      | I mean, and similarly, I think [[Federico Viticci\|Federico]] mentioned notes, quick notes, the, you know, new feature       |
| 15:40      | that they rolled out last year.                                                                        |
| 15:41      | No, that's not a thing there either.                                                                   |
| 15:42      | So, yeah, you want to see that buy-in where it's like, hey, if you announce these new                  |
| 15:46      | features every year, have shortcut support all right.                                                  |
| 15:49      | Like that should be part of announcing these new features is it's, A, we've got this feature           |
| 15:53      | and B, you can also access it in shortcuts.                                                            |
| 15:54      | You have to talk about it every time, but like that's table stakes at this point.                      |
| 15:58      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 15:59      | Like two that really stand out are Apple notes and [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]].                                          |
| 16:01      | Like [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] got new features last year.                                                             |
| 16:04      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 16:05      | And even though there is good support in shortcuts or [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]], none of the new features got          |
| 16:09      | actions.                                                                                               |
| 16:10      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 16:11      | And it's like, so is that the way it works?                                                            |
| 16:13      | We have to wait for you to add a new feature and then we have to wait another year for                 |
| 16:17      | you to add it, assuming we're going to get it, you know, I mean,                                       |
| 16:20      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 16:21      | Right.                                                                                                 |
| 16:22      | It smacks of like the r[[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] and [[Apple Notes\|Notes]] team, you know, building new features and the [[Shortcuts]]        |
| 16:26      | team not knowing that those features exist until it comes out and you're like, uh, left                |
| 16:30      | hand, right hand, come on guys, you know, talk to each other.                                          |
| 16:33      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 16:34      | And I get that they have privacy and secrecy concerns.                                                 |
| 16:37      | You know, Apple have had a lot of things leaked before and, you know, especially the week              |
| 16:41      | or a couple of weeks before [[WWDC]], which we're in as we record this episode and as it releases,         |
| 16:46      | you know, I can imagine it must be really disheartening if you're a developer, you've                  |
| 16:50      | been working on something for the last year, you know, you've been working really hard.                |
| 16:54      | And there's going to be like a big keynote, everyone's going to get to watch it and find               |
| 16:57      | out about it.                                                                                          |
| 16:58      | And there's, you know, this cool video demo.                                                           |
| 17:01      | And it's just an article, Mac rumors, like, and, and, and, and it kind of just, I can                  |
| 17:06      | imagine that being a massive let down for all of the work that you've done.                            |
| 17:10      | So I understand why they wouldn't necessarily talk about it internally and tell the short              |
| 17:14      | cuts team, but equally, why don't they get a shortcuts expert on their team or somebody                |
| 17:20      | who partners with the shortcuts team part of the time to add support for things like                   |
| 17:25      | that so that, you know, it doesn't necessarily, you know, like, hopefully fingers crossed              |
| 17:31      | there wouldn't be emerged conflicts if they keep it on like a side branch and just keep                |
| 17:34      | things up to date as they go.                                                                          |
| 17:36      | But if they could do that as they did things, because we only recently on the Mac got a                |
| 17:41      | shortcuts action to get the current web page from [[Safari]] and it's only on the Mac.                      |
| 17:46      | But iOS did get the ability to get the contents of what's on your screen a while ago, but              |
| 17:51      | that doesn't necessarily translate to a [[Safari]] page.                                                   |
| 17:54      | And, you know, how, depending on how you trigger this, it, you know, if you trigger something          |
| 17:58      | via the share sheet, then you actually don't want that action.                                         |
| 18:01      | You want whatever's coming through the share sheet.                                                    |
| 18:03      | And so you have to kind of do some smart stuff and it would be really nice if there were               |
| 18:06      | just deeper integration with the Apple native apps and, you know, show Microsoft how it's              |
| 18:12      | done.                                                                                                  |
| 18:13      | My hope on that is the adoption, especially by third parties of shortcuts in a way that                |
| 18:17      | I feel like an automator never really got.                                                             |
| 18:21      | I'm hoping that spurs Apple a bit when they realise, hey, there, all these other apps                  |
| 18:25      | are building this stuff in and users are responding to that and being positive about that.             |
| 18:29      | I hope that sort of feedback loops into Apple and they're like, way, we should be spending             |
| 18:33      | more time on our own stuff so that we don't look like we're second-class citizens on our               |
| 18:38      | own platform.                                                                                          |
| 18:39      | Um, but yeah, I mean, and, and full props to, uh, apps like [[Rogue Amoeba]], uh, or they                  |
| 18:44      | put out [[Audio Hijack]], obviously with some limited shortcuts of work, but then Sound                    |
| 18:47      | Source came out last week, an update that has like, I don't know, like more than a dozen               |
| 18:52      | different like shortcuts options, which is great.                                                      |
| 18:55      | I, I'm a huge fan of this.                                                                             |
| 18:57      | So yeah.                                                                                               |
| 18:58      | Okay.                                                                                                  |
| 18:59      | I did not realise that that update had come out and it's now going on my to-do list                    |
| 19:01      | to like, go check that out immediately after the show because I was on holiday last week.              |
| 19:04      | So I, I, I didn't read that there was a [[SoundSource]] update with [[Shortcuts]] support.                     |
| 19:08      | Oh yeah.                                                                                               |
| 19:09      | Yep.                                                                                                   |
| 19:10      | My weekends just disappeared.                                                                          |
| 19:11      | And to get back to your point, Rose, about, you know, secrecy inside Apple, you know,                  |
| 19:15      | the leaks that happen usually are in the manufacturing chain.                                          |
| 19:19      | That's usually where the leaks come rarely does Apple have software leaks and, you know,               |
| 19:24      | they make those employees sign documents when you join Apple that literally, you know, makes           |
| 19:30      | you feel like they're going to take your second child.                                                 |
| 19:33      | If you speak, right?                                                                                   |
| 19:34      | I mean, it's so bad that people leave Apple and they're still afraid to talk about it.                 |
| 19:38      | You know, so I don't think the issue is leaks coming out of teams working together and making          |
| 19:44      | a better product for the customer.                                                                     |
| 19:45      | It just seems to me so counter-intuitive that, you know, there should be a shortcuts team               |
| 19:51      | person talking to the [[Apple Reminders\|Reminders]] team and fully aware of what they're doing and saying, Hey,            |
| 19:57      | do you guys need help adding actions or do you want us to do it for you?                               |
| 20:01      | So when we get to [[WWDC]], they can say, not only do we have this cool feature, you can                   |
| 20:05      | automate it right out of the box.                                                                      |
| 20:07      | Instead of making all of us feel dumb, trying to figure out how to add that new feature and            |
| 20:11      | ultimately realising they just didn't bother to add it, you know, I mean, I have faith in              |
| 20:18      | the shortcuts team.                                                                                    |
| 20:19      | I feel like they're not going to go out and leak this stuff.                                           |
| 20:22      | So let them do their job.                                                                              |
| 20:23      | I mean, nobody wants shortcuts to be better than the people working on the shortcuts team.             |
| 20:28      | And I'm sure the stuff we're talking about is stuff that's driving them probably more                  |
| 20:32      | crazy than it's driving us, but you know, it's a big company and yeah, it seems like                   |
| 20:37      | that's something that they could solve.                                                                |
| 20:40      | I do wonder if perhaps some of why they are not so involved in the development of features             |
| 20:46      | is because how many features do we never know about because they never actually ship?                  |
| 20:51      | You know, how many things do they start and they try internally and they actually know                 |
| 20:55      | we're not going to do that, even though they've invested development work in it.                       |
| 20:59      | And you know, there is something to be said for it.                                                    |
| 21:03      | Don't start on things too early, but it kind of feels to an extent that some things maybe              |
| 21:07      | don't get started at all or are granting started much too late because there doesn't appear            |
| 21:12      | to be a automation framework for [[Safari]] tab groups, for example, there's nothing in Apple              |
| 21:17      | Script, there doesn't appear to be a single way to get this information.                               |
| 21:21      | And I've gone digging.                                                                                 |
| 21:22      | I have gone digging for this because I love tab groups, but you know, there's stuff in                 |
| 21:27      | there that's years old, I was surprised at one point trying to do an automation to set                 |
| 21:33      | up various like when I'm going in for recording a podcast, for example, I know I want all              |
| 21:38      | my windows set up such a way and and create everything.                                                |
| 21:41      | And I do stuff with spaces, there's no shortcuts or [[AppleScript]] support for spaces.                   |
| 21:46      | I wrote an article about spaces on these colours a few weeks back, and space has been there             |
| 21:50      | for like a decade.                                                                                     |
| 21:51      | And it's like, as far as you know, the system is concerned, it's the only way to the only              |
| 21:56      | way to automate it.                                                                                    |
| 21:57      | And I found was to use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to like trigger the like interface where you                   |
| 22:03      | have, you know, like a swipe and it brings up the ribbon across the top and then literally             |
| 22:07      | have it click on the button for a new space.                                                           |
| 22:10      | And you're like, why is there not just an action that's like create a new space?                       |
| 22:14      | Can you want me to make your day?                                                                      |
| 22:16      | Oh, yes.                                                                                               |
| 22:17      | [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                                                     |
| 22:19      | You can manage them on [[BetterTouchTool]].                                                              |
| 22:21      | You can pick a specific space and attach it to a keyboard shortcut and you're off to                   |
| 22:25      | the races.                                                                                             |
| 22:26      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 22:27      | All right.                                                                                             |
| 22:28      | So that's definitely better, but I definitely feel like it's Apple's just that's there.                |
| 22:31      | Literally your OS.                                                                                     |
| 22:32      | Yes.                                                                                                   |
| 22:33      | You built that feature in.                                                                             |
| 22:34      | You should have access to it.                                                                          |
| 22:35      | I agree.                                                                                               |
| 22:36      | I think it's crazy that I got to go to a third party app, but at least there is one.                   |
| 22:39      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:40      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:41      | It's like hooking together, [[BetterTouchTool]] and [[Keyboard Maestro]] and move to a basic                 |
| 22:48      | window layout.                                                                                         |
| 22:49      | I think they could have done like one action on like a shortcut and you'd be like, I'd                 |
| 22:53      | be done.                                                                                               |
| 22:54      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:55      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:56      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 22:57      | I mean, I'll tell you what, here's a challenge for shortcuts team for next year.                       |
| 22:59      | Spaces and then remembered spaces like you have tab groups in [[Safari]].                                  |
| 23:02      | Give me spaces that I can like have preconfigured.                                                     |
| 23:05      | Oh, that'd be awesome.                                                                                 |
| 23:08      | This episode of automators is brought to you by electric.                                              |
| 23:11      | When you think of the phrase boss move, you might think of making a bull business decision             |
| 23:15      | or maybe giving a great presentation of a big crowd.                                                   |
| 23:18      | The reality is sometimes being a boss in a small business means sorting out the orange                 |
| 23:21      | juice you spilled on your own keyboard or helping a staff member set up their new laptop.              |
| 23:25      | The team over electric knows more businesses, maybe like yours face these challenges.                  |
| 23:30      | That's why they've solved this problem for you by operating as your IT department instead              |
| 23:34      | of spending your time searching through unused application licenses, setting up employee               |
| 23:38      | laptops and answering never ending IT questions from your team.                                        |
| 23:41      | You can build that empire with electric acting as your IT department, you can get back to              |
| 23:46      | what you're good at.                                                                                   |
| 23:47      | Plus you get really cool IT platform to see and manage everything.                                     |
| 23:52      | Sometimes it's knowing what not to be doing.                                                           |
| 23:55      | That's really the important move and delegating it or making somebody else do that job is              |
| 23:59      | sometimes exactly what you need to do to be a great boss and to be good at what you do.                |
| 24:04      | Honestly, there's so many times when I would have loved something like electric from                   |
| 24:08      | setting up random employee tablets for people, which were a hodgepodge of devices that we'd            |
| 24:12      | collected from various places over time to just not having to deal with, hey, it's not                 |
| 24:18      | turning on again, dealing with all of that is something you can and you should hand off                |
| 24:23      | to electric.                                                                                           |
| 24:24      | If you've got business and you need to manage the IT as well as try and be good at your                |
| 24:29      | job, let electric do the work.                                                                         |

| 24:48      | Our thanks to Electric for their support of this show.                                                 |
| 24:52      | One thing that you said that stood out to me was that you had a problem you were managing              |
| 24:56      | through Google services and that's what led you into a web-based automation.                           |
| 25:02      | I think that really is a trigger for this for a lot of people.                                         |
| 25:05      | If you want to automate things and you're heavily using Google stuff, web-based automation             |
| 25:12      | is something you should definitely look at.                                                            |
| 25:13      | Yeah.                                                                                                  |
| 25:14      | I mean, I think the virtue of it is that most web services have an API.                                |
| 25:20      | Now, whether that API is accessible and how many hoops you have to jump through to do                  |
| 25:24      | it is a different matter, but the fact that the way the web is built and the software                  |
| 25:30      | upon which a lot of web apps are built, especially the kind of services a lot of us are using          |
| 25:35      | is that having an API seems like part and parcel of that.                                              |
| 25:39      | Maybe it comes out of the fact that these are all network-based services and a lot of                  |
| 25:43      | them grew out of traditions where you had maybe a client app on your machine, something                |
| 25:49      | like Mail, where you had a client-server relationship.                                                 |
| 25:56      | It blew me away because looking at these different services, you go into something like IFTTT          |
| 26:01      | or Zapi or whatever.                                                                                  |
| 26:02      | It's like a pretty good menu of services available.                                                    |
| 26:05      | I think Integromat blew me away because when you go in there, the number of services, it               |
| 26:12      | had access to things that I did not see anywhere else and could do things with those APIs.             |
| 26:17      | It's clear they spent the time building their modules for all these services to really take            |
| 26:22      | advantage of them to the utmost.                                                                       |
| 26:24      | It's not everything.                                                                                   |
| 26:26      | There is stuff that is definitely possible in the APIs that you can't do through necessarily           |
| 26:30      | web automation, but it makes sense that since everything is online and on the web that they            |
| 26:37      | would be able to talk to each other via the web.                                                       |
| 26:41      | I think that is something that's incredibly powerful because many of us spend a lot of                 |
| 26:46      | our time on the web.                                                                                   |
| 26:47      | I'm sure [[Safari]] or your web browser is your app that you probably have opened more than                |
| 26:52      | a lot of other ones.                                                                                   |
| 26:54      | I've spent a lot of time working on gluing web services together and also doing automation              |
| 26:59      | for stuff like blogs or WordPress platforms and stuff like that, where it's like, oh,                  |
| 27:04      | I want to be able to pull in content and show this content somewhere else.                             |
| 27:09      | There's a lot of tools available for that.                                                             |
| 27:12      | They vary in how technical they are, but certainly starting with tools like Make and                   |
| 27:17      | Zapier is a great way to think about what's possible with that, and the answer is quite                |
| 27:22      | a bit.                                                                                                 |
| 27:23      | Yeah, I would agree, especially because not everybody wants to necessarily do something                |
| 27:28      | like run a Mac mini or similar that's always on.                                                       |
| 27:32      | There's definitely a massive win in the fact that the internet is just always there, and               |
| 27:37      | it just sits there and whatever happens happens, and there is no need for you personally or            |
| 27:44      | your devices to be involved, which I think is something that could be a win, having everything         |
| 27:50      | offline on your machine and doing everything for you, depending on what you're doing.                  |
| 27:54      | If you're trying to hook up, say, for example, I don't know, [[Airtable]] and Google Doc, then             |
| 28:00      | why would you want your Mac to get in the middle of that?                                              |
| 28:03      | [[Airtable]] is online, Google Docs is online.                                                             |
| 28:06      | It makes sense to bridge that with an online tool, and I think that's what strikes me is               |
| 28:11      | really interesting about that article that you wrote for the Mystery Puzzle Hunt, where                |
| 28:18      | it's all online services, and so it makes perfect sense, but I had never really thought                |
| 28:22      | of the idea of just spinning up [[Discord]] channels for things as stuff goes through an automation        |
| 28:28      | that's not necessarily something that most people would need to do, but I can see the                  |
| 28:32      | same sort of thing being applicable to other stuff.                                                    |
| 28:36      | For example, if a project starts at work, then you might want to kick off a [[Slack]] channel              |
| 28:40      | for a really big thing so that people can then have all the chat in one place, and you've              |
| 28:46      | got a kind of archive of that, which is really interesting.                                            |
| 28:49      | Yeah, I've been doing a lot with also automating stuff, so over at Six Colours, Jason, Stella           |
| 28:57      | and I do a lot of our writing.                                                                         |
| 28:59      | We have some other stuff that we had been working on automating for that, and also for                 |
| 29:04      | some of the podcast stuff that we do over at the incomparable, and in some of those cases,             |
| 29:08      | it was relatively simple ideas like, hey, we've got a calendar of events, and we want                  |
| 29:13      | to be able to automate having that, if there are upcoming events, post them in our [[Slack]]               |
| 29:21      | channel or something.                                                                                  |
| 29:22      | It's like, yeah, there's built-in stuff for [[Slack]] that will let you do some of these things,           |
| 29:25      | but oftentimes your customisation is limited, like what your parameters can be, and how                |
| 29:31      | it works can be very limited in terms of how [[Slack]] is implemented at a certain API.                    |
| 29:36      | But you have the ability with these tools to sort of say, you know what, let's build                   |
| 29:40      | our own tool that sort of has the full range of the API options available to us.                       |
| 29:46      | So we can do stuff, and we can do stuff that's not allowed by that.                                    |
| 29:50      | For example, one of the big things that we wanted was setting up a way so that when we                 |
| 29:54      | posted a story, it got posted in both [[Slack]] channel for our member [[Slack]] as well as on                 |
| 30:01      | Twitter.                                                                                               |
| 30:02      | And now you're going across services in a way that's like, well, okay, but how is your                 |
| 30:07      | Twitter account going to know when a post goes up, and then how is your [[Slack]] account                  |
| 30:11      | going to know when a post goes up?                                                                     |
| 30:12      | And some of these things could be done separately, like using, say, RSS or something like that,        |
| 30:17      | but we noticed that it was very slow because of the way that the RSS stuff would grow up.              |
| 30:21      | And so we basically set up a system whereby we've got just a very simple workflow that                 |
| 30:27      | says essentially when something is posted on the WordPress blog, it hits a web hook,                   |
| 30:33      | and that basically sends messages to [[Slack]] and Twitter, and it's instantaneous, which                  |
| 30:37      | is wild.                                                                                               |
| 30:39      | So yeah, the discovery of web hooks for me was something, and I don't know how many                    |
| 30:43      | people are familiar with them, but basically they're URLs you can hit to say, hey, this                |
| 30:49      | just happened.                                                                                         |
| 30:51      | And that is enormous because it's fast, it's easy, and it's incredibly powerful with what              |
| 30:58      | it could do because you can just do it as simple as just being like a ping almost that                 |
| 31:02      | something's happened, but you can see data via them too.                                               |
| 31:05      | Yeah, it's an API call.                                                                                |
| 31:08      | You can have really simple unauthenticated ones where it's like, hey, if somebody hits                 |
| 31:12      | this really obscure URL that's got 200 odd random characters and plus a domain, then                   |
| 31:19      | it's going to go do the thing or you can have ones with authentication and stuff.                      |
| 31:23      | And I think it's something else you said, Dan, you could have had separate automations.                |
| 31:27      | You could have had one automation for the [[Slack]] channel, one automation for Twitter.                   |
| 31:30      | But the problem with that is then if something goes wrong, there's only one of them break              |
| 31:35      | or do you need to go and fix both of them if there's a change to something in the back                 |
| 31:39      | end?                                                                                                   |
| 31:40      | And this is why I like the idea of having online platforms personally for doing things                 |
| 31:44      | like this because this way I have unity between things.                                                |
| 31:47      | I don't have to have a WordPress plugin for posting to Twitter and a WordPress plugin                  |
| 31:51      | for posting to [[Slack]].                                                                                  |
| 31:52      | And then something else comes along, a great new social media platform, and I don't have               |
| 31:56      | to wait for somebody to create a WordPress plugin for that or try and create one myself                |
| 32:02      | or create somebody to create it.                                                                       |
| 32:04      | They're probably going to go and approach the Integromat Zapier if this, then that folks               |
| 32:08      | and say, hey, we've got an API.                                                                        |
| 32:11      | Can you hook us up?                                                                                    |
| 32:12      | Because that's promotion for us.                                                                       |
| 32:13      | It's promotion for you.                                                                                |
| 32:14      | We scratch your back, you scratch ours.                                                                |
| 32:16      | And then, bam, you've got that integration already because webhooks.                                   |
| 32:22      | It's the virtue of those systems is like, that's their bread and butter, right?                        |
| 32:25      | That's their business.                                                                                 |
| 32:26      | They want to have as many different APIs available because, like you said, it brings more customers    |
| 32:31      | in because people are like, oh, I can automate this and this and this other thing.                     |
| 32:36      | That's huge.                                                                                           |
| 32:37      | And so it's offshoring that.                                                                           |
| 32:39      | I mean, I have written stuff that accesses APIs directly.                                              |
| 32:42      | We have a setup on the incomparable so that when we go live on YouTube or on our audio                 |
| 32:50      | stream, it includes an embed on our live page, the incompparable.com/live.                            |
| 32:57      | And I had to, that was a weird thing that ended up being much harder than I thought.                   |
| 33:02      | But I had to write in PHP, I'm accessing the Google API and I'm like, this is a huge pain.             |
| 33:11      | It's so much better when I can rely on another service who's done all the heavy lifting and            |
| 33:16      | I just have to plug in some variables because my programming skills are limited.                       |
| 33:22      | I can usually figure stuff out, but I'd rather not spend the time doing that if there's an             |
| 33:26      | easier way to do it.                                                                                   |
| 33:27      | Yeah, yeah, absolutely.                                                                                |
| 33:29      | And I think that's one of the beauties of these things.                                                |
| 33:31      | It's great that things like [[Airtable]] have got APIs and if you've got an [[Airtable]] account               |
| 33:36      | and you've got a database for people who aren't familiar with the [[Airtable]] terminology in              |
| 33:43      | [[Airtable]].                                                                                              |
| 33:44      | They have a custom API page which is automatically generated for your base and then for every          |
| 33:51      | table in your base and you add some example records and it just populates the whole thing.             |
| 33:56      | It's amazing and magical.                                                                              |
| 33:57      | You just have to go and figure out how to do it and set it up and everything, whereas                  |
| 34:02      | if you spend a bit of time learning one of the web automation services, I mean, quite                  |
| 34:06      | frankly, you learn one, you learn them all.                                                            |
| 34:09      | It's basically just form fields with buttons to insert data from a previous step or similar            |
| 34:17      | or a special keystroke to initiate it or start typing it.                                              |
| 34:23      | But then somebody else has already done the work and you just have to know, okay, well,                |
| 34:27      | I want to get this data from here to here.                                                             |
| 34:30      | So the thing here is Google Docs.                                                                      |
| 34:32      | So I'm going to start with the Google Docs action and work my way backwards to everything              |
| 34:35      | else or start from the beginning and work your way forwards, whatever works.                           |
| 34:38      | And I think it's really nice when somebody else has done all the work for you as well.                 |
| 34:43      | It's uploading things to [[Dropbox]] as well as creating Google Drive folders and stuff.                   |
| 34:48      | It ends up being an awful lot of work and sure you can do it all yourself.                             |
| 34:51      | But do you have the time to and do you have the time to maintain it if it goes wrong?                  |
| 34:54      | I also really want the glue here now that lets me connect these web-based automations                  |
| 35:00      | with stuff on my local devices because even though we talked earlier about not wanting                 |
| 35:05      | to intermediate stuff, having your Mac like manage all of it, which is true, I have cases              |
| 35:10      | where I want to get stuff out of like a web service and into something on my Mac.                      |
| 35:15      | And that's a system that's not as smooth.                                                              |
| 35:17      | So for example, I think about on my website, I have a place where people who have bought               |
| 35:22      | my books can request a free book plate, which is just a little adhesive thing that goes                |
| 35:26      | to your book.                                                                                          |
| 35:27      | It's got a little sign on it and I'll sign them and I'll send them anywhere in the world.              |
| 35:30      | And so I have like a WordPress form that just emails me.                                               |
| 35:33      | And it's like on my Mac, I manage all that information in a number of spreadsheets.                    |
| 35:38      | And so it's like, well, there are ways to get information out of an email and into a                   |
| 35:43      | spreadsheet, but then you start getting in this very sort of kludgy situation of munging                |
| 35:50      | data from one side to the other and it gets a bit of a mess and it's like, oh man, it                  |
| 35:53      | would be nice if there was like a bridge somewhere that connects sort of all these automation          |
| 35:57      | powers that I have on my local devices with the ones I want to do on web services.                     |
| 36:01      | I mean, you know what, my solution to that problem would be, I wouldn't have the WordPress             |
| 36:05      | form go into email.                                                                                    |
| 36:06      | I'd have the WordPress form send it into a Google sheet or an air table base or something              |
| 36:10      | for me.                                                                                                |
| 36:11      | Yeah, that would be, that would be the smart way to do it, but I'm not that smart.                     |
| 36:15      | I think you are that smart.                                                                            |
| 36:17      | It's just you already had a system and I'm stuck in my ways.                                           |
| 36:19      | Yeah, exactly.                                                                                         |
| 36:20      | I've got my numbers spreadsheet.                                                                       |
| 36:21      | I live in numbers on my Mac, which is I know a little weird, but I love, I do love it.                 |
| 36:25      | I use Google docs a lot as well, but generally if I want to share stuff, but for some reason,          |
| 36:28      | I just really, I really like numbers.                                                                  |
| 36:30      | So it's so pretty, it is pretty, it is pretty, but also friendly to yeah, it's friendly,               |
| 36:37      | but I find numbers is actually a really great automation tool that people don't realise is             |
| 36:41      | an automation tool.                                                                                    |
| 36:43      | I had to, I was ripping diagnosis motor on DVD, I'm putting it on my Plex server because               |
| 36:49      | trying to stream that it's just not possible over here in the UK can't stream anywhere.                |
| 36:53      | So I bought the DVDs and I ripped them and I converted them and everything, but I had                  |
| 36:58      | to name all the files, right, and so you're doing like diagnosis murder S01, E01 and so                |
| 37:04      | on.                                                                                                    |
| 37:05      | And it's just like, hang on a second, I spent literally two minutes in numbers and I got               |
| 37:11      | myself two tables on a page where I was able to type in the season and the number of episodes          |
| 37:16      | in the season and then it would just populate a vertical list with the season number and               |
| 37:20      | the episode numbers for me so I could copy paste.                                                      |
| 37:23      | And it's like, okay, done.                                                                             |
| 37:25      | Now what am I going to go do with the rest of my evening?                                              |
| 37:28      | Thanks.                                                                                                |
| 37:29      | But because it can do math, it can do maths, it can concatenate strings, it can do fancier             |
| 37:35      | things like converting currencies and stuff, it's kind of a really good sneaky automation              |
| 37:40      | tool.                                                                                                  |
| 37:41      | It does have shortcut support at the very least for adding a new line down.                            |
| 37:44      | So maybe what you need is a push cut automation server.                                                |
| 37:47      | So when somebody posts to your WordPress forum, then push cut is the one that takes that hook,         |
| 37:53      | drives it and saves the data into your number sheet for you.                                           |
| 37:57      | That's going to be my next step.                                                                       |
| 37:59      | I'll definitely be working on that as a new project idea for me.                                       |
| 38:02      | Homework for you.                                                                                      |
| 38:03      | I do think there are some ways to also automate between web services and your Mac using keyboard       |
| 38:09      | maestro.                                                                                               |
| 38:10      | It's like it has webhook support and I found the easiest way to work between the two is                |
| 38:16      | [[Keyboard Maestro]].                                                                                      |
| 38:17      | It's just a little more advanced in shortcuts and does some stuff like that.                           |
| 38:21      | It's funny.                                                                                            |
| 38:22      | When I have [[Keyboard Maestro]] and I've used it, I have to say it is an app that often                   |
| 38:27      | remains impenetrable to me.                                                                            |
| 38:29      | It's clearly extremely powerful, but it has such a unique user interface that I have struggled         |
| 38:38      | to really adopt it for a lot of my automation needs, just because it is not a tool that                |
| 38:44      | I've used enough to really grasp all the intricacies of it.                                            |
| 38:48      | I'm going to send you an eight-hour field guide, Dan.                                                  |
| 38:53      | This is how it gets you, folks.                                                                        |
| 38:55      | You come on the show as a guest and you go home with so much homework that you'll be                   |
| 39:00      | screwed.                                                                                               |
| 39:01      | Yeah, I'm going to spend all my time reading about more automation things.                             |
| 39:04      | Well, watching in this particular case, but yeah, I have to say, I don't personally end                |
| 39:09      | up using the webhooks in [[Keyboard Maestro]] all that much, not because they're not great.                |
| 39:14      | They are, but just because it goes back to that requirement of having a Mac that's always              |
| 39:18      | on, right?                                                                                             |
| 39:22      | If my Mac's offline, I have an iMac, which is running as my Mac home server, because                   |
| 39:26      | I was previously using an Intel Mac Mini.                                                              |
| 39:28      | Turns out M1 iMac is considerably more energy-efficient, folks.                                        |
| 39:33      | That's my personal home server right now.                                                              |
| 39:36      | If I've taken it offline for whatever reason or I'm monkeying around with stuff and something          |
| 39:41      | doesn't work, then I've lost whatever it is, because the only downside of webhook or any               |
| 39:49      | kind of web automation that's coming down to your device is they're usually fire and                   |
| 39:53      | forget.                                                                                                |
| 39:54      | They're not going to go, hey, did you get that?                                                        |
| 39:56      | Is everything okay on your end?                                                                        |
| 39:58      | They're going to just go, here it is, bye-bye.                                                         |
| 40:01      | They're not going to wait around to see if you caught it, whatever it is.                              |
| 40:05      | I find usually personally, whenever I'm bridging stuff to my Mac or an iOS device or similar,          |
| 40:11      | I nearly always end up going by a [[Dropbox]], just save it, whatever it is, and to [[Dropbox]]                |
| 40:16      | or save a JSON file into [[Dropbox]] that I can read out to people when it appears.                        |
| 40:23      | Then I don't have the, I missed the thing.                                                             |
| 40:26      | It's something through it.                                                                             |
| 40:27      | I wasn't there to catch it.                                                                            |
| 40:29      | I arrived late, and now the eggs on the floor and it's broken.                                         |
| 40:32      | It's like, no, no, no.                                                                                 |
| 40:33      | It got put into the basket, and then I pick the stuff out of the basket and process it                 |
| 40:37      | later whenever is appropriate.                                                                         |
| 40:39      | Yeah, yeah, no, it's another way to do it, another way to interact, and I think you're                 |
| 40:44      | right that like being able to do sort of stuff on demand as opposed to having it automatic,            |
| 40:48      | like that's something that comes up a lot with Macs because you can't determine what                   |
| 40:52      | the state will be, will it be on, will it be running, will the services be firing correctly?           |
| 40:56      | But yeah, I think there is a lot of power there, and again, it's always one of those                   |
| 41:00      | things that you make the choice when you're doing automation work is, all right, how much              |
| 41:04      | time are we going to invest now into like saving time down the road?                                   |
| 41:08      | The answer is often like you can do a lot and you can save a lot of time, but like you                 |
| 41:11      | got to get over, it's like a roller coaster, you got to get over that initial big hill                 |
| 41:15      | of like, all right, I'm going to invest the time in figuring this all out, and then everything         |
| 41:19      | after there is much smoother.                                                                          |
| 41:21      | It's all downhill is what I'm saying, except for the little uphills in the way, but that               |
| 41:24      | is downhill.                                                                                           |
| 41:28      | This episode of The Automators is brought to you by TextExpander.                                      |
| 41:31      | Go to textexpander.com/automators for your shortcut to efficient, consistent communication       |
| 41:38      | and get 20% off.                                                                                       |
| 41:40      | TextExpander comes up all the time on The Automators.                                                  |
| 41:42      | In fact, they were the first sponsor of The Automators podcast.                                        |
| 41:47      | When they heard we were doing it, they said, we love automation.                                       |
| 41:50      | We want to help support this.                                                                          |
| 41:51      | And the fact is, TextExpander is the best on-ramp for automation on your Mac.                          |
| 41:57      | TextExpander is the text expansion tool that does so much more.                                        |
| 42:02      | As automators, text expansion is a great tool for us.                                                  |
| 42:05      | You just type CCELL, and it puts your cell phone number on.                                            |
| 42:09      | But with TextExpander, it goes so much further.                                                        |
| 42:12      | For instance, with TextExpander, you can hard code in key presses like the tab key or return.          |
| 42:18      | I use this when I create emails with TextExpander.                                                     |
| 42:21      | I trigger the TextExpander snippet in the subject line, so it types the subject.                       |
| 42:26      | Then it hits the tab key and goes to the body and types the body message.                              |
| 42:29      | So I can do all of this in one step.                                                                   |
| 42:31      | There's just no other text expansion tool that can do that.                                            |
| 42:35      | It can also run AppleScript.                                                                           |
| 42:36      | So I have it pull the first name from the recipient of the email and put it into the email.            |
| 42:41      | So it'll say, hi, Rose, because it got it out of the recipient name in the email.                      |
| 42:46      | It can also use the contents of the clipboard.                                                         |
| 42:49      | It can do so many great things.                                                                        |
| 42:51      | And if you want to get into automation, this is one of the best ways to do it because we               |
| 42:55      | are all spending too much time typing text repeatedly.                                                 |
| 42:59      | And TextExpander honestly just brings you to the next level.                                           |
| 43:03      | I've got over a thousand snippets and I save days of every year using TextExpander snippets.           |
| 43:09      | I know that because they send me the reports, I have the receipts.                                     |
| 43:13      | And that's just the beginning.                                                                         |
| 43:15      | With TextExpander, you can also get it for your team, so you can share it with them.                   |
| 43:19      | So you can write snippets and everybody sends out a consistent message to your customers.              |
| 43:24      | My daughter is a teacher.                                                                              |
| 43:26      | She's using TextExpander to help automate some of the process she does with student reporting.         |
| 43:31      | It's saving her so much time.                                                                          |
| 43:33      | No matter who you are, if you spend time behind a keyboard and you just have a little bit              |
| 43:37      | of automation skill, TextExpander can make your life easier.                                           |
| 43:41      | It's really that easy.                                                                                 |
| 43:42      | And TextExpander is available on the Mac, Windows, Chrome, iPhone, and iPad.                           |
| 43:47      | And best of all, as a listener of the automators, you can get 20% off your first year.                 |

| 44:01      | And our thanks to TextExpander for their support of the automators and all of Relay FM.                |
| 44:07      | So Dan, one of the things that you mentioned, and we may be stealing a little bit from [[Jason Snell]]          |
| 44:12      | here, but I think you'll be okay with that because you worked on this together,                  |
| 44:15      | is you've got, one of your automations is for podcast show notes because for people                    |
| 44:20      | who don't know, Six Colours has got a podcast for members.                                              |
| 44:24      | And podcast show notes are one of those things where all of us podcasters are trying to solve          |
| 44:30      | the same problem about 80 bajillion ways, which, you know, it works, we've had some fun with it.       |
| 44:36      | But taking notes during meetings and keeping links together and making sure that everything's          |
| 44:41      | in the right place really quickly is, I think, a problem a lot of people have.                         |
| 44:44      | And so I'm curious as to how you've ended up solving this problem.                                     |
| 44:48      | Well, you know, one of the things, so [[Jason Snell]] and I have sort of collaborated on this,             |
| 44:53      | it actually started out as a way of notes for editing.                                                 |
| 44:56      | So both Jason and I edit a lot of podcasts, and what happens is, you know,                             |
| 45:00      | you'll have a moment in a podcast where you're like, okay, something happened here,                    |
| 45:05      | and I know I need to go back to it later and fix that thing.                                           |
| 45:09      | But, you know, you may not have the presence of mind in the moment to write something down,            |
| 45:13      | or you have to like look at the time code, and you may kind of lose it, and then you                   |
| 45:16      | end up scrubbing around, it's like, would it be great?                                                 |
| 45:18      | I mean, we have this information, we know how long is elapsed in our recording files.                  |
| 45:22      | Couldn't we create some way of automating when you need to go back and like have your list of          |
| 45:27      | things to look at. And so Jason started this out by basically doing, I think,                          |
| 45:32      | a combination of stuff using, I try to remember exactly which tools he started using.                  |
| 45:38      | I think he was using [[Keyboard Maestro]] and some, an [[AppleScript]], basically.                            |
| 45:43      | And I read this, I was like, oh, this is clever.                                                       |
| 45:45      | Like, I do a lot of podcasts, too. This would be super handy.                                          |
| 45:47      | I wonder if I could do this in a shortcut. And it turned out I could.                                  |
| 45:51      | So I made a shortcut version of it, which Jason was like, oh, you know what,                           |
| 45:54      | never even occurred to me to make a shortcut because I just immediately go to these other              |
| 45:57      | tools because I assume shortcuts will not have the tools available.                                    |
| 46:00      | I was like, well, what we're doing essentially is creating a text file, getting a timestamp,           |
| 46:04      | and then putting it in with some note. All those things seem like things that shortcuts                |
| 46:10      | should be very capable of doing. I think the, and then it turned out to be a shortcut.                 |
| 46:16      | And then it turned out that the hardest thing to do was to actually get a correctly formatted          |
| 46:24      | timestamp, which was hilarious because like everything else was very easy.                             |
| 46:29      | Like, oh, yeah, make a file on the desktop with like the right name and a shirt.                       |
| 46:33      | Great. Enter some text. Great. But saying I want something that is formatted as,                       |
| 46:39      | you know, assuming zero, zero, zero, zero hours, zero minutes, zero seconds is sort of                 |
| 46:43      | the beginning, right? I want something that's formatted in that way so that I can go and look          |
| 46:47      | it up when I'm in logic or Ferrite or whatever. And it doesn't want to do that because it wants you    |
| 46:53      | to view things as a like time as in the clock time, right? Like what time is it? Not what time         |
| 46:58      | things are happening. So we bounced back a lot of things and we came up, actually had some great       |
| 47:02      | suggestions from a lot of our readers that basically were able to add clever ways to use               |
| 47:09      | sort of like [[Unix]] timestamps and stuff like that to sort of fake your way into it and then             |
| 47:14      | combined also with stuff on the [[Stream Deck]] so that we could essentially have a one button,            |
| 47:20      | press a button and then choose either from like a preset menu of things that have gone wrong,          |
| 47:25      | right? Like some of these connection drops or somebody swears and needs to get removed or              |
| 47:29      | you want to put it in a chapter or an ad or something like that and then just have like                |
| 47:33      | sort of a one or two buttons that you could hit very quickly. And I think one of the best              |
| 47:37      | things about this was and actually one of the things that my shortcut I think did a little             |
| 47:42      | better than his initial version is the first thing my shortcut does is immediately grab the time       |
| 47:49      | when you press the button. So it, you know, literally at the second when you're hitting it,            |
| 47:54      | it's not like I tried to write these things down in notes documents before and you're always,          |
| 47:58      | the time it takes you to write down, unless you're smart enough to like look at the clock              |
| 48:01      | immediately and then go write stuff down, you're always going to lose some time. Yeah, exactly.        |
| 48:06      | So this does it like instantaneously and that was, that was huge. So it is still something             |
| 48:10      | that I use pretty frequently when I'm recording a podcast to like sort of hit a button on my           |
| 48:15      | [[Stream Deck]] and be like, oh, yep, got it. Cross talk there or something. Got to take that out.         |
| 48:19      | And it's a great workflow. I was going to say, I have something similar, which I stole                 |
| 48:25      | from a previous guest on the show, which I'm using the [[Stream Deck#Stream Deck Pedal\|Stream Deck Pedal]] and I'm curious,              |
| 48:29      | [[Stream Deck]] or streamed at pedal or both? I've only used the stream. I just, I have,                   |
| 48:34      | I'm still in the introductory [[Stream Deck]]. I have the six button. I know I haven't done the trade,     |
| 48:38      | trade, you know, give it to a friend and then buy the bigger version yet, but I see how you people     |
| 48:43      | work. So what you're saying is you're early in your [[Stream Deck]] indoctrination. Indeed.                |
| 48:47      | You're only level one, you know, roses level six. So you got it. Yeah, I got it. I got a level up      |
| 48:53      | here. I need some more. I only have two [[Stream Deck\|Stream Decks]] in this room. You're fine then. You're all        |
| 48:59      | good. Exactly. Yeah. So, uh, but that's, that's been something that's really, I think has, I think     |
| 49:04      | the thing I struggle oftentimes the most with automation is not doing the automation itself,           |
| 49:09      | but realising that there is a task to be automated. I think that's the thing that I often              |
| 49:15      | have trouble with is like, you know, I'll sit around and be like, Oh, I want to play with              |
| 49:18      | shortcuts. And like, but unless I have a thing I actually want to do or a thing that I think about,    |
| 49:23      | Hey, you know, I do this thing all the time and it'd be great if that were not such a pain. Then       |
| 49:30      | I kind of find myself at loss like, Oh, sure, it gets this fun, but I'm just sort of like looking      |
| 49:34      | around browsing. Yeah. Automation in the abstract is, is a, is a fool's errand, right? You got to      |
| 49:39      | have a problem to solve. And that's when all of a sudden you start figuring stuff out. And             |
| 49:45      | then, you know, then in the future, you've got that tool set out bill or you can use it for some       |
| 49:49      | other problem. With the, with the timestamp, would you mind just kind of walking through the           |
| 49:55      | shortcut steps for people listening along? You know, it sometimes helps to hear how somebody,          |
| 50:01      | why somebody did certain actions and, and how, you know, what the challenges were.                     |
| 50:06      | Yeah. All right. So this is the most recent version, which is sort of a, as I said, it's               |
| 50:10      | sort of a joint collaboration between me and Jason. So, and I'm looking at the one, I should           |
| 50:15      | probably look at the one on the Mac just in case I think it's pretty similar, but I'll open up here.   |
| 50:21      | So the first thing it does is it receives, I think there's a received text input from quick            |
| 50:27      | actions. And if there is no input, it continues onward. And that's, I don't know why Jason did         |
| 50:34      | that. That's Jason changed, but I think it's a more of a procedural thing. It's probably for           |
| 50:38      | the trigger. Yeah. I think for the triggering that he's doing. So you first thing you do is you        |
| 50:44      | grab a date. You set a variable to the current date. So you have that. If you have not entered any     |
| 50:51      | input value, that's right. It's for the triggering. So he's got his presets where it basically can     |
| 50:54      | send a payload and say, this is a tech problem. This is a crosstalk. This is somebody swearing,        |
| 51:01      | et cetera, something like that. So it's already embedded in the triggers from his [[Stream Deck]].         |
| 51:06      | And if there is not text describing the issue, it throws up a prompt. So it doesn't ask for text       |
| 51:12      | and lets you enter some sort of information about what happened. Otherwise, it uses a text action      |
| 51:18      | which grabs the shortcut input. It then gets the contents. In my case, this is an alteration I've      |
| 51:24      | made. It gets the contents of a folder. I have a podcast, a folder on my drive called in progress,     |
| 51:30      | which is basically where [[Audio Hijack]] stores anything that's recording right now. And then             |
| 51:35      | it filters the contents of that folder using two criteria. First, that the file extension is wave      |
| 51:42      | because that's what I record in. And second, that the creation date is within the last six hours.      |
| 51:47      | The number there is somewhat arbitrary. I don't think I have many podcasts that go,                    |
| 51:53      | I've had podcasts that go like four hours. If we're doing like a long total party kill section,        |
| 51:56      | they will go pretty long. But I figured six hours was pretty safe, sorted by creation date,            |
| 52:02      | ordered by the latest first, and then limited to a single file because you only really need            |
| 52:08      | one file, right? I might be recording my file, the zoom side, a joint one, but as long as you          |
| 52:13      | got one, you're good. I then do a thing where I get the time between the creation date of that         |
| 52:19      | file and the current date in seconds. So now I have a big number of however many seconds has           |
| 52:25      | elapsed since the recording started. And then this is where the trick comes in. You add that           |
| 52:31      | number of seconds using the add time option to the, basically the beginning of the [[Unix]] epoch,         |
| 52:38      | which is January 1st, 1970 at 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, etc. You can in theory use the same time of any day,      |
| 52:44      | I think that works. And then we have a text field where we have, and it basically creates the          |
| 52:53      | stamp that's going to go in a file. And when I use the adjusted date, which is formatted with a        |
| 52:59      | custom format, which is the capital HH colon lowercase MM colon lowercase SS, which gives you,         |
| 53:05      | you know, it's all padded, right? So you want to make sure that you've got like that 0, 1. So it       |
| 53:11      | looks right, like consistent, and you can easily read it. And then it has that with a dash and         |
| 53:18      | then the text that we inputted or the text that was handed to the shortcut. And then it simply         |
| 53:23      | appends that line to a file that it creates in the in progress folder. So right next to where          |
| 53:30      | all my audio files are stored. And that file is just called notes dash, and then the date that         |
| 53:35      | the recording started, and it makes a new line every time. And so what you end up with is just         |
| 53:41      | a file saved there, that's a text file. And it has just a one line, you know, sort of quick thing      |
| 53:47      | about like, Oh, here's this thing happened here, this thing happened, here's this thing happened.      |
| 53:50      | And then when I have, I could talk about another automation for that for a second, but I have all      |
| 53:55      | those files get scooped up, basically, after the recording is done, packaged in a folder,              |
| 54:01      | and then sorted into the correct folder for depending what podcast it is. And they include             |
| 54:08      | the notes file with it. So when I go a day, two days, a week later to edit something,                  |
| 54:13      | the file with all the notes and it has been kept along with all the audio files. So I always know      |
| 54:17      | where to find it. And when I start editing that project, I have it to refer to.                        |

| 56:08      | Let's talk about that whole date and elapsed time bit in the middle. Because I think that's            |
| 56:14      | something that a lot of people could benefit from. Shortcuts, in my opinion, actually really           |
| 56:19      | simplifies dealing with dates and actually getting time between dates too. Because if you've ever done |
| 56:25      | date automation in AppleScript or any of the traditional programming languages,                        |
| 56:31      | it does require you to use, I guess, what they call absolute time, which is where you                  |
| 56:35      | got to use the [[Unix]] command and go and figure out what second you are basically in the universe        |
| 56:40      | to establish a baseline for time. It's a huge pain. At some point, Rose and I probably should          |
| 56:47      | cover that in more depth on the show. But I do feel like that for people that want to deal with        |
| 56:53      | time and dates, shortcuts, that's one of the things shortcuts is really good at in terms of            |
| 56:58      | finding where you are and the difference between that time and some other time.                        |
| 57:04      | I thought that was kind of ingenious the way you did it, really.                                       |
| 57:07      | I mean, I was not, I fully give credit to one of our readers who I think came up with that             |
| 57:11      | suggestion. Because in my earliest version, again, my background, I have some background in            |
| 57:17      | programming. I basically struggled to figure out how to get shortcuts to do this because it wants      |
| 57:23      | to view everything as a calendar date and time, a time of the day. And it doesn't want to deal         |
| 57:29      | with duration, despite the fact that there is like a convert measurement feel action as part of,       |
| 57:36      | I want to say, calculator that includes something called duration, but it could not understand what    |
| 57:41      | I was trying to give it. That was very frustrating. And so early in my first version, I basically      |
| 57:49      | kicked it out to like a Python script. That's like three lines of Python because they're like,         |
| 57:53      | I know how to do this in PHP or Python really easily. But I could not figure out how to do             |
| 57:59      | in shortcuts. And so I was kind of banging my head against the wall. And then I think,                 |
| 58:04      | this is where Jason, I bad at stuff back and forth a long time, because what I eventually had          |
| 58:08      | at one point was a series of calculate, like, expressions, where I essentially did the math            |
| 58:16      | by like, give me a number of seconds and let me like, divide by 3600 and like, you know,               |
| 58:21      | essentially turn those things into hours and minutes and seconds, which again, was not a thing         |
| 58:28      | that it was really equipped to do in so far as like, you can't just hand it a number of seconds        |
| 58:32      | and be like, tell me the hours, minutes and seconds, lesson to this, I had to like generate            |
| 58:36      | each of them, the hours, the minutes and the seconds and then glue them all together,                  |
| 58:39      | which was shortcuts native was the advantage, right? Didn't depend on having Python or any             |
| 58:44      | other programming language involved. But it was also more complex because it took several actions      |
| 58:47      | to do that. And that was the point at which somebody suggested like, Hey, you could probably           |
| 58:52      | sort of trick it into thinking this by viewing like the date as sort of zeros, you know, like the      |
| 58:57      | beginning of the epoch and adding to that, which was very clever solution. But it was something        |
| 59:01      | that frustrated me and felt like there should be a better shortcuts action for dealing with            |
| 59:07      | this kind of date and time information, as opposed to, you know, the normal sort of date and time      |
| 59:12      | stamp. Yeah, because there is an action for getting the time between dates, which is which is useful   |
| 59:17      | if you've got the time between dates. And I'm personally kind of interested in the fact that           |
| 59:22      | you are getting the file every single time, because I have a [[Keyboard Maestro]] macro that does          |
| 59:27      | something similar. But what happens is when I start my recording, the macro that I run saves           |
| 59:33      | the time stamp into a variable, which in [[Keyboard Maestro]] is a global variable, which we don't         |
| 59:37      | have any shortcuts. So you would have to save it somewhere, like using either a through party app      |
| 59:42      | or to a file. And then, you know, and then every time I hit the middle foot pedal of my stream         |
| 59:47      | data pedal, it just activates the [[Safari]] window with the Google doc in it, and hits command down       |
| 59:56      | and then and types in types in the timestamp, which it saved at the beginning of the macro,            |
| 01:00:00   | just just like you did down because that was something I realised. Because usually,                    |
| 01:00:04   | by the time you realise, actually, you need to take the note, you need to go back a couple of          |
| 01:00:07   | seconds already. So I didn't want to lose even more time. Yeah, if you put it further down in          |
| 01:00:11   | the shortcut or in your automation, it doesn't get the time until that point, which may be             |
| 01:00:16   | exactly my case. I think the original version that Jason had written, it was waiting to                |
| 01:00:20   | timestamp until after you enter the text. And I was like, well, it takes 10 seconds to enter           |
| 01:00:24   | the text, your timestamp is totally wrong now. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, getting the creation data           |
| 01:00:29   | files, fortunately, I think is pretty cheap as far as like, you know, like computing wise. So I        |
| 01:00:33   | don't worry too much about it. But it is a great point that like, if you had a way to persist          |
| 01:00:38   | information across shortcuts, like a global variable, which something exists in a lot of               |
| 01:00:41   | programming or other scripting tools, that would be a very good use for it. But it was, I think,       |
| 01:00:46   | a big priority for Jason and I when we were trying to design this to make it as portable as possible   |
| 01:00:50   | and not depend on any, you know, external third parties or tools as good as they are. If you           |
| 01:00:56   | want to make it portable, they're kind of stuck that way. Yeah. Just thinking out loud rows,           |
| 01:01:00   | wouldn't [[Data Jar]] work for that? [[Data Jar]] would absolutely work for that. [[Data Jar]] would be a             |
| 01:01:04   | great way of storing that information. Other options, of course, include things like Toolbox         |
| 01:01:09   | Pro and numerous other things, just saving a text file somewhere. But one thing that occurs to me      |
| 01:01:15   | is if people are using Timery, it has a format duration option, which might be something that's        |
| 01:01:23   | useful for people instead of getting something else. And in theory, if I were tweaking this a          |
| 01:01:29   | little bit more to my specific setup, what I would do now is use something like [[Audio Hijack]]s own      |
| 01:01:35   | automation process to get like, hey, just tell me what the current time on this recording is,          |
| 01:01:40   | right? But again, if you're making it portable as possible, you can't depend on having third           |
| 01:01:44   | parties in there. Yeah, I have to say, I did not think about getting the current time out of the       |
| 01:01:48   | [[Audio Hijack]] one. Oh my gosh, how did I not think about that? That's because it didn't exist when      |
| 01:01:52   | you built it. Yeah, that too. So my day job is writing PHP and JavaScript. The project that I          |
| 01:02:00   | work on at work is a Laravel application with a React front end. So JavaScript to me is not a          |
| 01:02:07   | problem facing with [[AppleScript\|AppleScripts]]. I hate JavaScript. Well, you come to me with Apple                  |
| 01:02:14   | Script and I'm like, oh, maybe not. But at the very least, there's plenty of options out there.        |
| 01:02:22   | This is what I love about things like this is there's so many different ways to solve this             |
| 01:02:26   | problem. And also just to highlight that, you were talking about Epoch and [[Unix]] Time.                  |
| 01:02:33   | Apple also has their own special one called Coco Time, which is time since midnight UTC January        |
| 01:02:39   | 1st, 2001, which is sometimes used in some of those things, which is just a little bit of              |
| 01:02:45   | extra fun. I thought you were going to say from like January 24th, 1984. And I'd be like,              |
| 01:02:50   | that would be such an Apple decision. That would be very Apple. But I have to say,                     |
| 01:02:54   | I somewhat appreciate the fact that it's January 1st, 2001, because it saves you 30 years.             |
| 01:02:59   | Right. Oh, yeah, that's great. Plus, you get to skip that whole Y2K-ish.                               |
| 01:03:04   | Yep. Yep. There's no worries about the ATM eating all our money over here anymore at any rate.         |

| 01:04:56   | Dan, I'm sure you've got some little automations that you use to get through your day. Not necessarily |
| 01:05:01   | as complex as the one we covered in the last segment. Drop some knowledge on this.                     |
| 01:05:07   | Well, one thing I realised at one point was there are certainly a lot of third party apps              |
| 01:05:12   | out there for letting you track different parts of your life and different metrics,                    |
| 01:05:16   | and especially in this case, health stuff. I had that moment of not wanting to really                  |
| 01:05:23   | have to spin up a whole separate app, and especially in some of these things, it's like,               |
| 01:05:26   | I don't know if I want the app to add this information or have to think about where this               |
| 01:05:30   | app might be sold or whatever. Surely, I can do something like this with automation. In particular,    |
| 01:05:34   | I was like, well, I want to track my weight. My doctor is always recommended that I weigh              |
| 01:05:39   | yourself once a week and keep track. You can see the trends over time. I was like, well,               |
| 01:05:44   | an automation, that seems like a perfect place for an automation. I basically just created a           |
| 01:05:49   | super basic automation that I think I have it remind me, like a setup to remind me once a week         |
| 01:05:57   | on Monday morning, first thing or something. It's like, would you like to run this record              |
| 01:06:03   | weight shortcut, but I can always trigger manually if I want to. Basically, I run that shortcut.       |
| 01:06:08   | It just prompts you, asks for a number with today's weight, and then it uses the log health sample     |
| 01:06:14   | option that's built into shortcuts, where you can tell it what kind of date or what kind of date       |
| 01:06:19   | are you storing, in this case, weight, and then the input that you provided along with the current     |
| 01:06:22   | date. Then I decided I wanted to get a little more complex just because I wanted to also have it       |
| 01:06:28   | tell me then, while you've recorded this weight, I want to know my rolling average as it were.         |
| 01:06:36   | I did a simple thing where it goes through and finds all the weight health samples from the last       |
| 01:06:41   | six weeks, orders them, and then basically gets the four health samples out of that because            |
| 01:06:50   | here's my fudge for myself, which is I'm not always great at remembering to do this despite            |
| 01:06:54   | having the shortcut to remind me. I figure if I go over the last six weeks and then I take             |
| 01:06:59   | four health samples from there, I will at least have enough for a monthly average.                     |
| 01:07:04   | Then it sets the variable of the earliest date to when the last date was and splits them out by        |
| 01:07:13   | new lines, turns them into text. I don't remember why I was doing all this, but I had reasons at       |
| 01:07:17   | the time. I think it's because I'm creating a time between dates here and having to calculate          |
| 01:07:23   | essentially the average because even though I knew it would be, again, I'm not taking like,            |
| 01:07:30   | hey, if I were great at this and did it literally every single week, I could just grab the last        |
| 01:07:34   | four and average it. But because I'm doing the last six weeks, I kind of have to do a little bit       |
| 01:07:38   | of data finagling to say, hey, over the last several periods since date X, it might be six             |
| 01:07:46   | weeks, it might be five weeks, et cetera. I kind of had it do all that finagling to tell me how        |
| 01:07:52   | many weeks had elapsed and then calculate the average over that and show a notification that           |
| 01:07:58   | says your average weight over the last X weeks is average. And then it just pops up. So I can          |
| 01:08:05   | kind of usually like do it and say, oh, okay, I've gotten my, you know, over the last six weeks,       |
| 01:08:09   | I've only weighed myself three times, but it can tell me the average of those three times over         |
| 01:08:13   | the last six weeks. So I like having that instant feedback too, right? Because you can go into the     |
| 01:08:19   | health app and you can be like, all right, let me look at the chart there. But I find the chart        |
| 01:08:23   | sometimes annoying because you got to toggle the right scale. And yeah, I don't like that as much.     |
| 01:08:27   | So getting just a one number like, hey, this is where your average is at based on the samples          |
| 01:08:31   | that we can have, very simple and straightforward. Yeah. Did you consider just saying, because I       |
| 01:08:37   | was just looking at this right now, because you reminded me, my doctor asked me to track my            |
| 01:08:43   | peak flow rates for exhalation to check how my asthma is doing. And it turns out very well.            |
| 01:08:50   | But I had to log this data and I was just logging it into [[Drafts]], which is not a terrible place        |
| 01:08:54   | because I've got the data with the dates and everything. But I've just realised that I can             |
| 01:08:57   | store that in the health app. So what's for? Yeah, exactly. There's actually an option for that,       |
| 01:09:03   | which is great. But I was just looking at the find health sample. And there's the option to,           |
| 01:09:11   | instead of just getting like, or going over multiple ones, I was able to say like type is              |
| 01:09:19   | weight, for example, start date is in the last six weeks. And then I've done a sort by end state,      |
| 01:09:25   | order by latest, and then limited it to like four. Would that change? That's basically what I did.     |
| 01:09:32   | I have sort by start date order latest first, and then I don't know why I flipped the dates.           |
| 01:09:36   | Again, this is why I haven't looked at the ins and outs of it in a while. And it's like, I don't       |
| 01:09:40   | remember why I did. It's like, it's like, I don't comment my code, right? I should be commenting       |
| 01:09:44   | this like, I did this for a reason. Remember that. I was just checking that I had understood what      |
| 01:09:48   | you were doing correctly, because I briefly in my head understood that you were doing this manually    |
| 01:09:53   | and went, hmm, I wonder why that is. The answer is, there's always a better way to do it. It's         |
| 01:09:57   | just the moment, what I've come up with in the most. No, no, no. The answer is, there's always a       |
| 01:10:01   | different way to do it. But the best way to do it is the way that you've done it, because it's         |
| 01:10:05   | actually done. That's right. That's a great call. Yeah. So it makes a lot of sense. No, I really       |
| 01:10:11   | like that, because especially if you don't already have a smart scale, and then, you know, like,       |
| 01:10:15   | is it only operating on your home network? I have a eufy scale, and it's not that I don't            |
| 01:10:19   | trust eufy, but I've used the Arrow app to block its internet access, so that it's just,             |
| 01:10:24   | you know, it logs via the app on my phone to the health kit, and that's it. Thank you very much.       |
| 01:10:28   | But I appreciate the fact that it does do that, you know, when my phone turns on,                      |
| 01:10:33   | and I open the app. But I can imagine that a lot of people wouldn't necessarily want a Wi-Fi           |
| 01:10:38   | connected scale. And if you've already got scales and they work, then why not just, you know,          |
| 01:10:43   | save yourself some cash and do it via shortcuts to log it? You know, that makes perfect sense.         |
| 01:10:49   | Yeah, I agree. Yeah, it's nice to have the option, and you can also control where it is,               |
| 01:10:53   | right? Like, that's the thing I feel great about is like, I know it's on my phone, I trust Apple       |
| 01:10:57   | with, you know, other health data. So I'm totally fine having this information in there.               |
| 01:11:02   | Yes, yes. And then you could always get really nerdy and convert it into a really pretty chart         |
| 01:11:07   | with Charty, if you wanted to, or something. I do have that, but I haven't yet mastered that           |
| 01:11:11   | aspect of it. But it's something that's always in the back of my head.                                 |
| 01:11:14   | Yes. And I think you can extend this to a lot of other things as well. I did something similar         |
| 01:11:18   | for my parents in blood pressure, because they had a non-smart blood pressure monitor.                 |
| 01:11:22   | And now they have a somewhat smart blood pressure monitor, because I stuck an NFC tag on it            |
| 01:11:26   | and programmed it. So when they tap the NFC tag, it opens the shortcut or runs a shortcut for them     |
| 01:11:30   | to log the data, which works perfectly. And now they have what they think is a really smart            |
| 01:11:37   | blood pressure monitor. It's not that smart, it's just a shortcut, but it works.                       |
| 01:11:41   | You know, that's a really good idea to use an NFC tag to do something where you need to monitor        |
| 01:11:45   | or reporting, you know, stick one near your scale, being another good idea, like if you get your       |
| 01:11:50   | scale against a wall. Yes. Yeah. Now, it turns out my parents have a whole host of like non-smart      |
| 01:11:56   | health devices. And so I just went a bit nuts with NFC stickers. So my dad's blood glucose             |
| 01:12:02   | monitor has an NFC sticker on it. So when he logs it, he can just tap his phone to it.                 |
| 01:12:06   | And, you know, and I put all of them in a folder on their home screen as well.                         |
| 01:12:12   | My parents haven't learned the app library yet. It's kind of sweet. I tried explaining it to them      |
| 01:12:17   | when we were on holiday together in New York a little while ago. They didn't understand.               |
| 01:12:20   | They were like, but where are the apps if they're not on my home screen?                               |
| 01:12:24   | They're there. You just don't manually organise. It doesn't matter. I put together a folder for        |
| 01:12:31   | them. And I actually wonder now, maybe I should do a widget stack, but that's possibly going a         |
| 01:12:35   | bit far for them if they've not introduced themselves to the app library yet.                          |
| 01:12:39   | Yeah. Yeah. One thing at a time. Yeah. Exactly.                                                        |
| 01:12:43   | Any other helpful little, little automations you've got to do?                                         |
| 01:12:47   | I will, I'll throw out there this other one that I made, which is it's, it's a little complex,         |
| 01:12:53   | but has a very basic premise, which is every day I read a set of comics via a browser.                 |
| 01:13:01   | And I wanted to create a shortcut to open all of these at the same time, because I have a bookmark     |
| 01:13:07   | group, which is fine. But the trick was some of them only update on certain days. And so I             |
| 01:13:14   | didn't want it to open the ones that were not new on those days. So I have some that update on         |
| 01:13:18   | Monday, Wednesday, Friday. I have some that only show up on Sunday. And I wanted to be able to make    |
| 01:13:22   | this like, oh, can I make a customised shortcut for doing this? And I did write this up also at        |
| 01:13:27   | six dollars at one point. But essentially what it takes is it starts out with a dictionary that's      |
| 01:13:32   | basically a multi, a multi dimensional dictionary that includes both a schedule within it and a        |
| 01:13:39   | URL. Okay. And then it runs a big loop basically over that take, you know, gets the current date       |
| 01:13:45   | figures out like what date it is, what day of the week. Yeah. And then it creates a list of all        |
| 01:13:54   | these, the, you know, applicable one, like a basic creates a list and then repeats over that list,     |
| 01:14:00   | checks the date sees if that date is within the schedule in order to do this, I basically created      |
| 01:14:05   | like a ad hoc scheduling format, where it is basically I just use a two letter abbreviation            |
| 01:14:13   | and string them all together as a string. So like the schedule might say like, you know,               |
| 01:14:18   | m o a capital M lowercase o capital W lowercase e capital F lowercase r for Monday, Wednesday,         |
| 01:14:24   | Friday, etc. It checks for that. And then the trick for this was one of the sites where I read a       |
| 01:14:30   | bunch of comics has, it's kind of annoying the URL for the actual strip is basically, you know,        |
| 01:14:40   | the name of the site slash the name of the street, the strip slash year slash month slash day, right,  |
| 01:14:48   | like your standard sort of thing, but like all there's like different, it's a rewrite, etc,            |
| 01:14:52   | blah, blah, blah. And so you can't bookmark it right because the date hasn't happened yet.             |
| 01:14:57   | And so I could make bookmark folders that just open the generic tape, but it means every time I        |
| 01:15:01   | have to click through like, okay, because it only shows you like a like part of the strip and you      |
| 01:15:04   | have to like click through because it gets me really annoyed. So I was like, well, I just wanted       |
| 01:15:07   | to build the URLs for me. So that's essentially what I have it do is I have it go like, Hey,           |
| 01:15:11   | if today is on the schedule, and if the comics at the specific site, then take a date string that      |
| 01:15:16   | we already have, add it to the URL I've stored in the dictionary, and then add that to like my         |
| 01:15:22   | final list of things to open. And then after I get out of that loop, I basically take my list,         |
| 01:15:27   | split it by new lines, and then told tell [[Safari]], like open all these URLs. So that's a total thing    |
| 01:15:34   | you could do in shortcuts that makes a lot of sense. Exactly. It works really well. Actually,          |
| 01:15:39   | I have to say it's one of the remote most robust shortcuts I have made in that I've never had a        |
| 01:15:44   | once I figured out how to make it work. I've never had a problem and never had to touch it again.      |
| 01:15:49   | It does literally what I want it to do every single time. And this is one of the places where          |
| 01:15:54   | Apple sort of predictive AI stuff works well, because you know, my frequently my phone will            |
| 01:16:01   | tell me like as I wake up in the morning, and I'm checking my phone and everything, it'll pop up a     |
| 01:16:04   | little, you know, like the little widget where it's like, Hey, you normally read your comics           |
| 01:16:08   | right now. It's cool. I do want to read my comics at the button and it'll launch the shortcut and      |
| 01:16:12   | everything works great. So that's a little handy tool I built for myself just because I was like,      |
| 01:16:18   | there must be an easier way to do this, the, I think, which is the credo of all automators everywhere. |
| 01:16:25   | Absolutely. And I love that. I found the post on Six Colors, by the way, and put a link to             |
| 01:16:29   | that in the show notes for anybody who's looking. It's there with automate this reading comics.        |
| 01:16:34   | And I love that idea. And I have different links to open on different days. So I'm going to be         |
| 01:16:39   | stealing this from you, though, sadly, not for comics. I might steal the comics too.                   |
| 01:16:43   | It works for anything. Yeah.                                                                           |
| 01:16:46   | Well, we're going to talk about how all of us consume digital media, like comics and books             |

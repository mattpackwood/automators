# Overview
Spotlight provides a convenient and efficient way to search for and access content on [[Apple]] devices. It allows users to quickly and easily search for files, applications, emails, and other content stored on their device. It is accessible via a simple keyboard shortcut or by clicking on the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar.

With Spotlight, users can search for specific keywords or phrases to locate files and content across their device. Search results are matched as the user types and are organised by category, making it easy to find the desired information quickly.

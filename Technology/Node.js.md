# Overview
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run [[JavaScript]] on the server using a [[JavaScript]] engine from Google to execute code. Node.js is commonly used for building scalable network applications and is well-suited for real-time web applications. It also has a large ecosystem of libraries and packages that make it easy to extend its functionality.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, allowing it to handle a large number of connections simultaneously. This makes it a popular choice for building micro services, APIs, and web servers.

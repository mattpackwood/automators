# Overview
Split View for iPadOS is a feature that allows users to view and interact with two apps simultaneously on their iPad. This feature enables multitasking capabilities by dividing the screen into two separate windows. This may be two different apps or even two instances of the same app where supported. The partitioning may also be set so as to be non-equal, allowing one app to take up more space on the screen than another.

Split View is typically useful for tasks where multiple areas are required - e.g. writing an email while referencing a web page, taking notes during a video call, editing photos alongside a social media feed.

# How to Use Split View for iPadOS
To use Split View on an iPad, start by opening the first app you want to use. Next, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the Dock, then drag the second app you want to use to the edge of the screen. The second app will then open in Split View alongside the first app. You can adjust the divider between the two apps by dragging it left or right. To exit Split View, simply swipe down on the app divider or press the Home button.

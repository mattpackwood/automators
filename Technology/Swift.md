# Overview
Swift is a programming language developed by [[Apple]] for building apps and software primarily for its own platforms like iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It was introduced in 2014 as a more modern and improved alternative to [[Objective-C]], which was previously the main language used by [[Apple]] developers.

Swift is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a good choice for beginners as well as experienced programmers. Its syntax is considered concise yet expressive, borrowing ideas from other languages like [[Python]] and [[Ruby]] to make it user-friendly. Swift emphasises safety and performance, minimising common errors and running code more efficiently.

# Features
## Safety and Reliability
One key feature of Swift is its focus on safety. The language helps prevent common programming errors by performing checks, such as ensuring variables are initialised before use, and managing memory automatically. This reduces the likelihood of crashes and bugs, thus hopefully making Swift applications more stable than their predecessors.

## Performance
Swift is designed to be fast. The language is compiled to native machine code, meaning it runs directly on the hardware without the need for an interpreter, which makes it very efficient. Swift also uses modern, high-performance compiler technologies to optimise the code for faster execution.

## Interoperability with Objective-C
Swift is designed to work seamlessly with [[Objective-C]], making it easier to integrate into existing projects. Developers can use Swift in combination with [[Objective-C]] within the same project, allowing them to gradually adopt the new language without a complete rewrite.

# Resources
- [[Apple]] provides extensive [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and resources, including tutorials and guides, to help developers of all levels.
- Many online platforms offer courses in Swift, including free options and options like [[Swift Playgrounds]].

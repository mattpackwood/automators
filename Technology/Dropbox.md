# Overview
Dropbox is a cloud storage service that allows users to store, share, and access their files online. Unlike traditional storage methods, which rely on physical hardware like drives, Dropbox stores files on servers located around the world. This means you can access your files from any device that has an Internet connection, be it a computer, smartphone, or tablet. When you save a file to Dropbox, it is automatically synced across all your devices linked to your Dropbox account. For instance, if you upload a photo from your phone, it will be viewable on your computer just moments later. This seamless syncing is one of the main selling points of Dropbox, making it incredibly convenient for both personal and professional use.

Users can also easily share files and folders with others through Dropbox. This makes collaboration on projects or sharing photos and documents with friends and family very straightforward. You can control the level of access others have to your files, restricting some to view-only or giving them permission to edit.

Another key feature of Dropbox is its ability to keep multiple versions of a file. If you accidentally delete something or need to revert to a previous version of a document, Dropbox maintains a history of changes, making it possible to recover older versions of your files.

# How It Works
- **Cloud Storage** - When you save a file or folder to Dropbox, it uploads the file to their cloud servers. These servers are powerful computers that run 24/7. They store and manage your data, ensuring that your files are available whenever you need them. The files are encrypted during transfer and while they are stored, providing a level of security.
- **Syncing** - Syncing means updating your files across different devices. Dropbox uses a sync client—a small piece of software installed on your device—that constantly monitors for changes. If you edit a file on your computer, the sync client updates the changes on Dropbox’s servers and then pushes these updates to your other connected devices, ensuring consistency.
- **Sharing** - To share a file or folder, you generate a shareable link through the Dropbox interface. You can send this link to others, who can then access your files through a web browser. You can set permissions for these links, allowing recipients to either view or edit the content.
- **Version History** - Every time you make changes to a file in Dropbox, the previous version is saved. This version history allows you to retrieve older versions if needed. This feature is particularly useful when collaborating on documents, as it lets you track and review changes made by others.

# Advanced Features
- Smart Sync is a feature available in Dropbox's paid plans. It allows you to see all the files in your Dropbox account on your desktop without actually downloading them. This saves hard drive space. You can choose which files to keep locally and which to keep in the cloud.
- [[Dropbox Paper]] is a collaborative workspace designed to help teams create, review, and organise documents. It’s integrated with Dropbox, allowing easy insertion of files from your storage into documents and real-time collaboration.
- Dropbox can integrate with various other productivity tools such as [[Microsoft 365]], [[Slack]], and [[Zoom]]. This means you can open, edit, and share Dropbox files directly within these applications, enhancing your workflow efficiency.

# History
- Dropbox was founded by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi. Drew Houston conceived the idea for Dropbox after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Together with Ferdowsi, also a student at MIT, they launched Dropbox in 2007 to address the need for a reliable, user-friendly cloud storage solution that would allow people to access their files from any device.
- The company officially launched to the public in 2008.

# Notes
- Dropbox offers a free tier with a limited amount of storage and several paid plans that provide more storage and additional features, such as advanced sharing controls and priority support.

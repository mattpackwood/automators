# Overview
A shell is a program that provides a text-based user interface for users to interact with the operating system. They function as a command interpreter, taking input from the user in the form of text commands and executing them in the operating system. They play a critical role in the interaction between users and the operating system, allowing users to manage files, run programs, and perform numerous other types of tasks efficiently.

Shells can vary in functionality and features, with some offering more advanced capabilities such as [[Shell Scripting|scripting]] and automation. They provide a way for users to navigate the file system, launch programs, modify system settings, and perform other system-related tasks efficiently.

# How Does a Shell relate to a Terminal?
The window through which users interact with a shell is known as the [[terminal]]. Together, the terminal and shell form a powerful tool for users to control and manage their operating system.

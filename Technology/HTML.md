# Overview
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language is the language used to define pages to be viewed in applications known as web browsers[^1]. These pages may be opened directly, or served via a web server application to the browser via an appropriate protocol (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS). The definitions use text annotated by tags to determine what text and other assets to display on a page when it is rendered.

For example, this content:

```html
<hr>
<blockquote>Light and microwaves are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum</blockquote>
<hr>
```

Would be displayed something like this in a web browser.

<hr>
<blockquote>Light and microwaves are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum</blockquote>
<hr>

In addition, the exact style can be further enhanced using [[CSS]], and interactivity can be provided via the use of [[JavaScript]].

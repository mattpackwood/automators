# Overview
Skype is an application that allows people to communicate with one another over the Internet. Launched in 2003, it allowed users to send text messages, make voice calls, and even participate in video chats. It has been widely used for personal conversations, business meetings, and even online classes. Skype was first released in 2003 and quickly became popular due to its ability to connect people from around the world easily and affordably. Skype works by using Voice over Internet Protocol ([[VoIP]]). VoIP converts voice signals into digital data that can be transmitted over the Internet. This allows users to have conversations in real-time, just like a traditional phone call, but without the need for a standard telephone line.

# History
Skype was created by a team of developers from Estonia and Denmark. The key founders were Niklas Zennström from Sweden and Janus Friis from Denmark. They worked together with Estonian developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who handled much of the technical development. Their combined efforts resulted in the launch of Skype in 2003.

Microsoft acquired Skype in May 2011 for $8.5 billion. This move was part of Microsoft's broader strategy to enhance its portfolio of communication tools and services. The acquisition marked a significant step as it combined Skype's popular consumer communication platform with Microsoft's enterprise capabilities.

Microsoft [[Lync]], later rebranded to Skype for Business in 2015 and eventually evolved into Microsoft Teams, was Microsoft's existing unified communication platform aimed primarily at enterprise users. Lync provided features such as instant messaging, video conferencing, and voice-over IP (VoIP) services, but it was more enterprise-focused compared to Skype's consumer appeal. move was designed to leverage the strong brand recognition of Skype while enhancing it with enterprise-grade features. Skype for Business provided a familiar interface for Skype users but with the additional security, management, and compliance capabilities required by businesses. In the years following the acquisition, Microsoft further evolved its communication strategy by developing [[Microsoft Teams]], which integrates chat, video conferencing, file sharing, and many other collaborative tools into a single platform. [[Microsoft Teams]] sought to take the best elements of Skype for Business and added more collaborative features, becoming the central hub for teamwork in [[Microsoft 365]]. [[Microsoft Teams]] replaced Skype for Business in August 2021.

While Skype remains popular for personal use in the 2020s, it faces competition from other communication platforms like [[Zoom]], [[Microsoft Teams]], and [[WhatsApp]]. These alternatives often offer similar features and, in some cases, better performance or additional functionalities.

# Noteworthy
- Created in 2006 by Peter Maurer.
- Acquired by [[TextExpander (Sponsor)|SmileOnMyMac]], who release version 2.0 in October 2007.
- Pivoted from Mac only to being a cross-platform software as a service (SaaS) product in 2016.
- Originally a Mac only product, it was launched on iOS on 26 August 2009.
- TextExpander provided a software development kit (SDK), that enabled other software developers on iOS to enhance their own apps with TextExpander.
	- This enabled TextExpander use in enhanced apps using physical keyboards as well as soft keyboards.
	- In 2021, TextExpander began work on deprecating the SDK in favour of a more capable third party keyboard option.
- The first software custom keyboard for iOS for TextExpander was release for iOS8 (September 2014).
- Version 3 of TextExpander for the Mac shipped in March 2010, version 4 in June 2012, and version 5 in May 2015.
- In April 2016 the sixth iteration was released with a new, and highly controversial, subscription pricing model.
	- This was the canary in the coal mine, and after a lot of vitriol and years of subscription hating, many organisations have followed suit.
	- They did reduce the subscription cost, but even so, lost a lot of users in the process, and kept the product and the business going.
	- While they were pioneering, the feedback across the user base and the wider-media was that the switch could have been done differently, and many other organisations learnt from those mistakes prior to their own transitions to subscription models.
- January 2017 saw TextExpander released for Windows.
- April 2019 saw TextExpander release a public beta for [[Google Chrome\|Chrome]], and a full release in February 2020.
- Since the move to a subscription model, the app has received some visual and user interface updates, but the majority of the development time appears to have gone into supporting the development of the organisational and team support.

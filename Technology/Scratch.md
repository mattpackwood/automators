# Overview
Scratch is an educational programming tool designed to allow young people (but it is not restricted to young people) to learn coding principles using a simple visual interface. It is free and allows the creation of digital stories, games and animations. Scratch is free and also has a global supportive community of educators and students.

Scratch has been localised to more than 70 languages and is managed by the non-profit Scratch Foundation; though it was originally developed by MIT.

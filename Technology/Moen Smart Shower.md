# Overview
The [[Moen]] Smart Shower is a digitally controlled shower system. It allows users to customise their showers with precision, providing a range of features for convenience and comfort. The core idea behind the Moen Smart Shower is to offer a more personalised and efficient way to shower. Instead of traditional controls, the system uses a digital interface that can be operated via a wall controller or via a smartphone app. Users can set the exact water temperature, choose different spray patterns, and even save multiple shower presets for different family members or moods.

With the Moen Smart Shower, you can also control your shower remotely. This means you can start your shower while you are still getting out of bed, ensuring that the water is at the perfect temperature by the time you step in. The system's integration with smart home ecosystems like [[Amazon Alexa]] or [[Google Assistant]] allows for voice commands, adding another layer of convenience.

The Moen Smart Shower is also intended to promote water conservation. It can pause flow automatically when you are shampooing or soaping up, and resume it when you are ready to rinse, helping to reduce water wastage.

# How It Works
The Moen Smart Shower system replaces traditional shower valves and controls with a digital valve. The valve is typically installed within the wall and connected to your water supply. The digital controller, which can be wall-mounted or handheld, communicates with the valve to manage water flow and temperature. When the shower is active, the digital controller sends signals to the valve to mix hot and cold water to the desired temperature.

# Installation and Compatibility
Installing a Moen Smart Shower typically requires professional plumbing expertise, especially if upgrading from a traditional shower system. It is important to ensure compatibility with existing plumbing and electrical systems prior to purchase.

Before purchasing, check the specifications and requirements to ensure that your home can support a smart shower system.

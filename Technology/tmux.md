# Overview
`tmux` is a powerful terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple virtual terminal sessions to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal window. Many advanced terminal applications offer this type of functionality with actual sessions, but by virtualising them you can automate and utilise them independent of your terminal application - even across client platforms.

With `tmux`, users can split their terminal window into multiple panes, each running its own command or application. This helps in multitasking and managing multiple tasks simultaneously. 

Additionally, `tmux` allows users to detach and reattach to terminal sessions. This means that users can start a session, disconnect from it, and later reconnect to it without losing any work or progress.  This makes it useful for maintaining ongoing sessions if you are  connecting from multiple devices and wish to maintain a common session.

Overall, `tmux` is a valuable tool for increasing productivity and efficiency when working in a terminal environment.

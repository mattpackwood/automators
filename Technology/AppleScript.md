# Overview
AppleScript is a scripting language created by [[Apple]] and included in macOS. It is extensible through scripting additions and through applications offering functionality via interfaces known as *Dictionaries* - not to be confused with the data structure of dictionaries used in many other programming and scripting languages. In fact, the terminology and style of AppleScript is something very different from other languages in that it is intended to be more human readable, but the looser syntax and diversity in the way third parties have implemented AppleScript support means that even armed with documentation and examples, it can be difficult to develop new scripts compared to other languages.

[[Sal Soghoian]], is notable for his involvement in AppleScript during his time as a a product manager for automation technologies at [[Apple]], and for the numerous resources he has produced to support people in the use of the language.

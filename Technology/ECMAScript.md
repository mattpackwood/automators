# Overview
ECMAScript is a scripting language specification that was created in the mid-1990s. It was the defining documentation for [[JavaScript]], but also covered Microsoft's flavour, known as *JScript*, and Macromedia's (/Adobe's) *ActionScript*.

# Notes
- ECMA cam from "*European Computer Manufacturers Association*", but no longer carries that link.

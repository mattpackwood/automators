# Overview
SGML, or Standard Generalized Markup Language is a way to define a way (i.e. a language) in which you can annotate text to meet a particular need. A common example might be for printing where you might use a markup language to specify what text should be shown as a heading, or underlined. Another might be to markup the text with actor and stage directions for a radio play.

All language definitions conform to the following

> - **Declarative:** Markup should describe a document's structure and other attributes rather than specify the processing that needs to be performed, because it is less likely to conflict with future developments.
> - **Rigorous:** In order to allow markup to take advantage of the techniques available for processing, markup should rigorously define objects like programs andÂ databases.

# Notes
- [[HTML]] is an example of markup defined using SGML.
- [[XML]] fulfils a similar purpose to SGML, effectively providing a subset of the functionality, but as such, with reduced complexity.\

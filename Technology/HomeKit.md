# Overview
Introduced in 2014, HomeKit is a framework developed by Apple that allows users to control smart home devices using their Apple devices. It provides the underpinning technology for the unified [[Apple Home|Home]] platform; for communicating with and managing HomeKit compatible accessories, making it easier for users to set up, control, and automate various aspects of their smart home environment.

With the HomeKit platform, users can create scenes, which are customised combinations of actions that can be triggered with a single command. For example, a "*Good Morning*" scene could turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, and start the coffee maker. HomeKit also supports automation, allowing users to set up rules for their smart home devices to act automatically based on time of day, location, sensor readings, or other triggers.

HomeKit utilises end-to-end encryption to ensure the security and privacy of user data, and also integrates with [[Siri]], allowing users to control their smart home devices with voice commands to their Apple devices.

# Key Features

- Supports the creation of customisable scenes for multiple HomeKit enabled devices
- Home automation - based on triggers and conditions

# Notes
- HomeKit utilises [[Bluetooth]], Wi-Fi, and [[Thread]] to communicate across the platform with devices. The exact channels depending upon what the devices communicating support.
- HomeKit has supported [[Matter]] since iOS 16.1.
- [[HomePod\|HomePods]], [[Apple TV\|Apple TVs]], and iPads have all been able to function as Home Hubs, central control hubs for remote access, guest access and automations. However with iOS 16 , the use of iPads as a Home Hub was deprecated.

# Overview
Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used to exchange digital data between electronic devices over short distances. It operates at 2.4 GHz and allows devices such as smartphones, laptops, and wearable gadgets to communicate with each other without the need for cables.

# How Bluetooth Works
Bluetooth technology uses radio waves for communication. When two Bluetooth-enabled devices are in close proximity, they can establish a connection (pairing) and transfer data. 

Pairing involves a one-time process in which the devices exchange encryption keys to ensure secure communication. Once paired, the devices can establish a connection automatically whenever they are in range.

Each device also has a unique identifier, known as a Bluetooth address, which helps in identifying it during the initial pairing process.

# Bluetooth Profiles
Bluetooth profiles define specific use cases and functionalities for different types of devices. Common Bluetooth profiles include:

- **HFP:** Hands-Free Profile - for hands-free calling.
- **A2DP:** Advanced Audio Distribution Profile - for streaming audio.
- **HID:** Human Interface Device Profile - for connecting input devices like keyboards and mice.

# Bluetooth Versions
The Bluetooth standard has gone through several iterations since its inception. Each version has offered improved features and capabilities. 

Some of the major Bluetooth versions include Bluetooth 4.0 (Low Energy), Bluetooth 5.0 (with increased range and speed), and Bluetooth 5.2 (with enhanced audio capabilities).

# History
Bluetooth technology was invented by Dr. Jaap Haartsen and his team at Ericsson in 1994.

The name "*Bluetooth*" comes from a medieval Scandinavian king, King Harald Bluetooth, who is known for uniting Denmark and Norway. The Bluetooth technology was named after him to symbolise the unification of different devices and technologies through wireless communication, much like King Bluetooth's unification of the Scandinavian countries.

# Overview
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a way of manipulating audio signals using computers or specialised digital hardware. When you listen to audio, DSP helps improve the sound quality and efficiency of these audio signals. DSP takes an analogue audio signal (like a microphone's output), converts it into a digital form that a computer can understand, processes it to improve or alter its properties, and then turns it back into an analogue signal that we can hear.

# How DSP Works
## Step 1 - Analogue to Digital Conversion (ADC)
Before DSP can be applied, an audio signal, which is naturally analogue (like sound waves), must be converted to a digital form using an Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). This process involves sampling the audio signal at specific intervals (the sampling rate) and converting those samples into binary data.

## Step  2 - Digital Processing
Once the audio is in a digital form, it can be processed using algorithms.

E.g.
   - **Filtering:** Removing unwanted noise or frequencies.
   - **Equalisation:** Adjusting the balance between different frequency components.
   - **Compression:** Making the signal's volume levels more consistent.

## Step 3 - Digital to Analogue Conversion (DAC)
After the digital signal has been processed, it needs to be converted back into an analogue signal using a Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) so that it can be played through speakers (or headphones).

# DSP Applications
- **Music Production** - DSP is widely used in studios to mix and master tracks. Tools like equalisers, reverb, and autotune all rely on DSP.
- **Telecommunications** - DSP ensures your voice is transmitted clearly over phone lines, and helps in reducing noise and echo.
- **Hearing Aids** - Modern hearing aids use DSP to enhance specific sounds and reduce background noise, making it easier for people with hearing loss to understand speech.
- **Consumer Electronics** - Devices like smartphones, TVs, and home theatre systems use DSP to deliver high-quality audio and enhance user experience.

# Deeper into DSP
## Fourier Transform
A fundamental concept in DSP is the Fourier Transform, which converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain. This is an application of the   mathematical Fourier transform.

## FIR and IIR Filters
DSP often uses specific types of filters called Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. These filters help in removing unwanted parts of the signal or enhancing certain aspects of it.

## Real-Time Processing
A critical aspect in DSP is real-time processing, where DSP systems must process audio signals instantly. This is particularly important in live sound applications and interactive systems.

## DSP Chips
Dedicated DSP chips are used in many devices for efficient real-time audio processing. These specialised processors are designed to handle complex mathematical operations quickly and efficiently.

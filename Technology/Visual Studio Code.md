# Overview
Visual Studio Code, often abbreviated as VS Code, is a powerful, free, and open-source code editor developed by [[Microsoft]]. It is designed to be lightweight yet capable, featuring a range of tools and features that make it a popular choice among software developers. VS Code can be used for writing code in multiple programming languages and plain text syntax formats making it a highly versatile tool for anyone creating code or content in plain text.

# Operating Systems
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

# Features
- **User Interface** - VS Code boasts a clean and intuitive interface that makes it accessible for beginners while still offering advanced features for seasoned developers. The interface includes a file explorer, source control, a terminal window, command palette, and various debugging tools.
- **Extensions and Customisation** - one of the most powerful aspects of VS Code is its extension ecosystem. Users can browse and install a wide array of extensions from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) to add new language support, themes, debuggers, and more. This makes it possible to tailor the editor to fit individual development needs.
- **Intelligent Code Editing** - VS Code offers intelligent code completion, also known as [[IntelliSense]], which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. Code snippets further speed up development by allowing users to insert commonly-used code fragments.
- **Built-in Git Integration** - with built-in Git integration, users can perform source control tasks directly within the editor. This includes cloning repositories, committing changes, checking diffs, and managing branches.
- **Debugging Tools** -  robust debugging capabilities come out-of-the-box. Users can set breakpoints, inspect variables, view call stacks, and interact with their running programs, significantly simplifying the debugging process.
- **Remote Development** - VS Code enables users to work on codebases located on remote machines, containers, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This is especially useful for working in diverse and complex development environments.
- **Collaboration** - [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) is an official [[Microsoft]] extension that enables real-time collaboration between developers. This feature allows multiple users to share their VS Code environment, including running servers, terminal content, and debugging sessions, making it an invaluable tool for pair programming and collaborative coding.
- **Custom Tasks and Workflows** - Users can define custom tasks for their workflows, automating repetitive actions like building projects, running tests, or deploying code. This customisation streamlines the development process and ensures consistency across projects.

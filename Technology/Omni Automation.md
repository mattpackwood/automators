# Overview
Omni Automation is a powerful scripting and automation technology developed by  the [[Omni Group]] for their suite of productivity apps, including [[OmniGraffle]], [[OmniOutliner]], [[OmniPlan]], and [[OmniFocus]]. This technology allows users to create custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, and enhance the functionality of these applications.

Using [[JavaScript]] as the scripting language, Omni Automation provides users with the ability to access and manipulate objects within the Omni apps, automate complex workflows, and create custom features tailored to their specific needs. Scripts can be created and executed directly within the apps, making it relatively easy for users to integrate automation into their workflows.

With Omni Automation, users can streamline their workflow, save time on repetitive tasks, and unlock even more power in their Omni apps. Whether it's automating the creation of visual diagrams, organising tasks and projects, or generating reports, Omni Automation empowers users to take control of their productivity and achieve more with less effort.

# Scripting Capabilities
Omni Automation scripts can perform a wide range of tasks, including:

- Accessing and modifying document content
- Creating and manipulating objects within the apps
- Automating repetitive actions and tasks
- Integrating with external services and APIs
- Customising the user interface and adding new features

By harnessing the power of Omni Automation, users can extend the capabilities of their Omni apps beyond what is possible with the standard built-in features, making them more efficient and versatile tools for day-to-day tasks.

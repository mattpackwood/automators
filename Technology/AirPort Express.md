# Key Features

## Wireless Networking
- AirPort Express supported various Wi-Fi standards, including 802.11a/b/g/n. This ensured compatibility with a wide range of devices. 
- It operated on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands, helping to reduce interference and improve network performance.

## AirPlay
One of the most popular features was AirPlay.

## Printer Sharing
AirPort Express allowed users to share a USB printer over the network. By plugging a printer into the USB port on the AirPort Express, everyone on the network could print wirelessly.

# Advanced Features

## Extending Network Range
AirPort Express could be used to extend the range of an existing wireless network. Users could place it in a part of their home where the Wi-Fi signal was weak to boost the signal strength in that area.

## Guest Network
The guest network feature allowed visitors to have internet access without gaining access to the main network. This helped improve network security by keeping the primary network isolated.

## Security Options
AirPort Express supported various security protocols, such as WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2).

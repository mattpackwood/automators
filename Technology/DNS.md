# Overview
DNS stands for Domain Name System. This is the system whereby computerised addresses (IP addresses) are matched to names (domain names). A common analogy has been address books and matching phone numbers to the names of individuals or companies.
 The system works by having servers that store lists of matches. These are authoritative name servers. If any server in the network receives a request to lookup an address and it is not the name server for that address it will reach out across the network to find a server that does know the details and then fetch it from there to cache and pass on to the original requestor.

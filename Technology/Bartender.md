# Overview  
Bartender is a utility for macOS that allows users to organise and manage the menu bar items on their Mac. This application is particularly useful for those who have numerous menu bar apps and require a more streamlined and efficient way to access them - particularly when the menu bar space may be limited.

# Operating Systems  
- macOS

# Features  
- Hide and rearrange menu bar items.
- Show hidden items temporarily with a keyboard shortcut or mouse click.
- Show menu bar items based on customisable rules.
- Custom profiles.
- Menu bar styling.

# Notes  
- Bartender is available to purchase as a one-time payment, and  is also included in the [[SetApp]] subscription service.
- The transition from Ben Surtees to [[Applause]] was fraught with suspicions as the first anyone knew of the changes was due to some mismanagement of code signing.

- Bartender supports automation through [[AppleScript]],  and to a limited extent through [[Shortcuts]] which can be used to set a focus filter (only).

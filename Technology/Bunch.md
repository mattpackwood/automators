# Overview
Bunch is an automation tool for the Mac that allows users to create groups of apps, websites, and scripts that can be launched (or closed) at once. It helps users streamline their workflow by creating custom combinations of applications and tasks that can be executed simultaneously, making it a great tool for virtual workspace set up and shifting contexts.

# Operating Systems
- macOS

# Features
- Grouping of applications, websites, and scripts for launching/closing

# Notes

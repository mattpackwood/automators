# Overview
Microsoft Excel is a leading desktop spreadsheet application that has been one of the core applications in Microsoft's office suite.

It is available on both Windows and Mac, and has utilised both [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA), as well as [[AppleScript]] for automation, and there are several libraries available for programming languages such as [[Python]] that allows developers to work easily with Excel spreadsheets.

Excel is also available on mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads, as well as online via a browser, though these versions are somewhat more limited than the desktop version.

Excel utilises an [[XML]]-based file format and can be extended through a plugin architecture utilising what are known as *add-ons*.

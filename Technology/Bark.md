# Overview
Bark is a technology platform designed to protect children when they are online. It uses artificial intelligence-based monitoring to check for potential safety concerns in social media, text messages, emails, and other forms of digital communication. It was created in response to growing concerns about online dangers such as cyberbullying, inappropriate content, and potential predators, Bark aims to provide tools to help keep their children safe online while also respecting their privacy.

Bark connects with over 30 different platforms, including social media sites (like [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]]), email services (such as [[Gmail]]), and even text messages. Once connected, it scans and analyses the communications for any potential issues.

# Features
## Notifications and Alerts
One of Bark's key features is its ability to notify parents or guardians when potential issues are detected. Instead of providing parents with full access to their child's communications, which could infringe on their privacy, Bark sends alerts highlighting the specific concern. These alerts may include the context of the message and suggestions on how to address the issue appropriately.

## Privacy and Trust
Privacy is a significant concern when monitoring children's online activities. Bark attempts to balance safety with respect to privacy by avoiding constant and invasive monitoring. Instead of giving parents full access to all communications, it focuses on alerting them only when problems arise. This method helps maintain a level of trust between parents and children while ensuring the children's safety.

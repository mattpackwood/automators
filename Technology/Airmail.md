# Overview
Airmail is an e-mail client application for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and [[Apple Watch]]. It operates on a freemium model providing limited functionality until you subscribe, though some long term users will find they are grandfathered in for access to some of the premium features.

The application supports the typical power user features such as a unified inbox, [[Shortcuts]] support, [[AppleScript]] support, and rules. It is also well known for its custom actions, powerful share extension options, and support for plugins such as those used in encryption (e.g. [[GPG]]).

Airmail's Pro licensing is subscription based, but supports volume discounts for business and education.

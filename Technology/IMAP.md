# Overview
IMAP, or Internet Message Access Protocol, is a standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. Unlike POP (Post Office Protocol), which downloads emails to a local device, IMAP allows users to view and manage emails directly on the server. This means that actions taken on one device (such as marking an email as read) will be reflected across all devices accessing the same email account through IMAP. 

IMAP is widely supported by email services and clients, making it a popular choice for accessing emails across multiple devices. It also offers features such as folder management, search capabilities, and the ability to synchronise email across devices. 

Overall, IMAP provides a convenient and efficient way for users to access and manage their emails without the need to download them to a specific device.

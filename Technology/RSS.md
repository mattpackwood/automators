# Overview
RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication, is a technology that allows users to easily stay updated on the latest content from their favourite websites. Instead of having to visit each website individually to check for new content, users can subscribe to the website's RSS feed and have updates delivered to a single location, such as a feed reader or email inbox.

RSS is also the technology that underpins the feeds used by podcasts. It is the syndication that makes an audio file a podcast rather than just an audio download.

RSS feeds typically contain a summary of the latest published content, along with links to the full content.

One of the key benefits of RSS is that it provides a convenient way for users to consume content from multiple sources in one place, saving time and effort. Additionally, RSS feeds are often updated automatically, ensuring that users always have access to the most current information from their favourite websites and podcasts.

While RSS saw a decline with the deprecation of [[Google Reader]] and the rise of social network streams, in the late 20-teens, RSS saw a resurgence and has been joined by a number of read later and aggregation services that can utilise RSS as well as other sources.

# How RSS Works
RSS works by using a standardised [[XML]] format to structure and deliver content updates. Websites that support RSS will have a special link called a feed URL that users can subscribe to. When new content is published on the website, the RSS feed is automatically updated with the latest information.

Users can access their RSS feed using a variety of tools, such as feed readers, web browsers, podcast clients, or even some email clients. These tools will periodically check for updates to the RSS feed and notify users when new content is available.

Overall, RSS is a powerful tool for staying informed and up-to-date on the latest content from your favourite websites. It streamlines the process of consuming online content and allows users to stay organised and informed without the need to visit multiple websites individually.

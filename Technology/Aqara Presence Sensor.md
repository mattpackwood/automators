# Overview
Aqara Presence Sensors are smart home devices designed to detect human presence with high precision. Unlike traditional motion sensors that work by detecting large movements, these sensors use advanced technologies to identify even minor movements, such as subtle hand gestures or slight head turns. This capability allows them to provide more accurate and timely information about human presence in a room, enhancing automation routines and ensuring a seamless smart home experience.

# Types
## FP1
The Aqara FP1 Presence Sensor is known for its high precision and reliability. It utilises mmWave radar technology to detect slight movements and differentiate between humans and other moving objects. This sensor is suitable for various applications, such as automating lights, HVAC systems, and security protocols within a smart home ecosystem. 

Key features of the FP1 include:

- **High Sensitivity** - Detects subtle movements like breathing or slight hand gestures.
- **Differentiation** - Can distinguish between humans and pets or other objects.
- **Integration** - Compatible with various smart home platforms including [[Aqara|Aqara Home]], [[HomeKit|Apple HomeKit]], and other [[Zigbee]]-supported systems.
- **Installation** - Typically requires mounting on walls or ceilings for optimal detection coverage.

## FP1E
The Aqara FP1E offers a balance between functionality and cost, bringing advanced presence detection capabilities to a broader audience. While it shares many core features with the FP1, there are a few distinctions:

- **Sensitivity** - Slightly lower sensitivity compared to FP1 but still highly accurate for most home automation needs.
- **Cost** - More affordable, making it a practical choice for larger installations needing multiple units.
- **Integration** - Maintains compatibility with major smart home platforms but may have reduced customisation options compared to FP1.
- **Installation** - Similar to FP1, can be mounted on various surfaces for effective detection.

## FP2
The Aqara FP2 is an advanced model, incorporating the latest technologies for even more precise presence detection. The FP2 is particularly suited for environments requiring high-security measures and detailed monitoring:

- **Ultra-High Sensitivity** - Can detect the most minor movements, providing an increased level of accuracy.
- **Advanced Differentiation** - Enhanced algorithms for distinguishing between different human activities and other moving objects.
- **Customisation** - Offers more extensive integration options and settings customisation for advanced users.
- **Enhancements** - Includes additional features such as zone-specific detection, which allows parts of a room to be monitored independently.
- **Installation** - More complex to set up, may even require professional installation for optimal performance.

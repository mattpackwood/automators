# Overview
PowerShell is a [[shell]] and scripting language developed by Microsoft for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It provides an object-oriented environment that allows users to interact with system components as objects, making it particularly useful for system administration and automation tasks.

# Features
- **Object-Oriented**: 
	- PowerShell treats data and system components as objects, allowing users to access and manipulate them using object-oriented programming principles.
- **Cmdlets**: 
	- PowerShell commands, known as *cmdlets*, are small, focused tools that perform specific tasks. Users can combine *cmdlets* to create powerful scripts for automation and management.
- **Pipeline**: 
- 
	- PowerShell supports pipeline execution, allowing the output of one *cmdlet* to be passed as input to another *cmdlet*, enabling seamless data processing and transformation.
- **Scripting**: 
	- PowerShell provides a scripting language with control flow structures, functions, and loops, making it suitable for complex [[Shell Scripting\|scripting tasks]] and automation workflows.
- **Integration**: 
	- PowerShell integrates with existing technologies such as [[.NET Framework]], [[WMI]] (Windows Management Instrumentation), and [[COM]] (Component Object Model), enabling users to access a wide range of system resources.

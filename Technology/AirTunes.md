# Overview
AirTunes is a technology developed by [[Apple]] that allows wireless streaming of high quality audio content from an [[Apple]] device (like an iPhone, iPad, or Mac) to compatible speakers, such as those connected to an [[AirPort Express]] or an [[Apple TV]]. The central idea is to make it easy to stream music or other audio wirelessly, without needing physical cables.

AirTunes operates over a Wi-Fi network, enabling audio to be sent from your device to an AirTunes-compatible speaker. This means you can play your favourite songs from your device and have them play out loud on speakers that are perhaps in another room or place.

The technology was initially part of [[Apple|Apple's]] iTunes software but was later integrated into their broader [[AirPlay]] streaming protocol, which includes the ability to stream video and mirror screens in addition to audio.

# Notes
- While AirTunes specifically refers to audio streaming, [[AirPlay]] is the broader technology that includes AirTunes and extends its capabilities to video streaming and screen mirroring.
- AirTunes relies on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and uses [[Apple|Apple's]] Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) to ensure high-quality audio with minimal delay. The protocol also includes mechanisms to handle network variability and ensure that the audio does not stutter or drop out.
- Initially, AirTunes was only compatible with [[Apple|Apple's]] [[AirPort Express]]. Only later was support extended to [[Apple TV]] and select third-party speakers. With the adoption of [[AirPlay\|AirPlay 2]], more devices across various brands have become compatible, further enhancing the usability and reach of the AirTunes technology.

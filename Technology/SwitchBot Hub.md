# Overview
A SwitchBot Hub is a smart device designed to act as a central controller for other SwitchBot smart devices. The SwitchBot Hub enhances the basic [[SwitchBot]] device functionality by connecting them to a Wi-Fi network and allowing the devices to be controller from a single app, including remotely.

The SwitchBot Hub functions as a bridge between your home’s Wi-Fi network and your SwitchBot devices, which usually communicate via [[Bluetooth]]. This means that, instead of needing to be within Bluetooth range to control a SwitchBot device, you can use the Hub to send commands over the internet. For example, you could use your smartphone to turn on a SwitchBot-enabled light switch or lock your door while you’re at work.

# Scheduling and Automation
The SwitchBot Hub works with the SwitchBot app to offer advanced features like scheduling and automation:

- **Scheduled Tasks** - You can set up specific times for your devices to turn on or off. For instance, you could schedule your [[SwitchBot Curtain Opener]] to open your curtains every morning at 7 am.
- **Scene Creation** - Scenes allow you to control multiple devices simultaneously with a single command. For example, a "Good Night" scene could turn off all lights, close curtains, and lock the doors.
- **Integrations** - The Hub can often be integrated with other smart home ecosystems like [[Amazon Alexa]], [[Google Assistant]], and [[IFTTT]].

# Types

## Hub
The original SwitchBot Hub serves as the foundational model in the SwitchBot lineup, offering comprehensive connectivity and control over your SwitchBot devices. It connects to your home Wi-Fi network, enabling you to manage and automate your smart appliances from anywhere via the SwitchBot app. This Hub supports a range of integrations with other smart home ecosystems, such as [[Amazon Alexa]], [[Google Assistant]], and [[IFTTT]], allowing for seamless voice control and advanced automation scenarios. Designed to meet the needs of most smart home users, the original hub provides reliable functionality, including scheduled tasks, scene creation, and remote access.

## Hub Mini
The Hub Mini is a more compact and cost-effective version of the standard SwitchBot Hub. Despite its smaller size, it offers many of the same essential features, such as remote control of SwitchBot devices via Wi-Fi, scheduling, and integration with voice assistants like [[Amazon Alexa]] and [[Google Assistant]]. 

## Hub 2
The Hub 2 builds on the capabilities of the original SwitchBot Hub by incorporating additional features and enhanced connectivity options. While retaining the core functionalities like remote control, scheduling, and scene creation, the Hub 2 offers advanced integrations and a more robust signal range to better connect multiple devices throughout a larger home. The Hub 2 is geared towards users with extensive smart home setups who require greater capacity and advanced features to manage their devices efficiently.

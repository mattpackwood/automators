# Overview
A terminal is a text-based user interface on a computer. In the early days of computing, and even later computing where mass access to a centralised computer, such as a mainframe or a minicomputer, was required. They were physical devices that consisted of a keyboard and a screen, allowing users to input commands and view text-based output. They typically utilised monochromatic screens, but later models did allow for colour support.

In modern computing, terminals can refer to both physical devices and software applications that emulate the functionality of the traditional terminals. These software terminals, also known as command line interfaces (CLIs), allow users to interact with computers using text commands. This method of interaction is often preferred by developers and system administrators for its efficiency and flexibility.

# Overview
Safari Technology Preview is an experimental version of the [[Safari]] web browser designed for developers and advanced users. It allows users to test upcoming features and technologies that are still in development and provide feedback directly to [[Apple]]. This browser is beneficial for those interested in web development, performance testing, and experiencing the latest web standards before they are officially released.

This should be considered a beta app.

# Operating Systems
- macOS

# Features
- As [[Safari]], but with access to the very latest web standards and features still in development.

# Notes
- Safari Technology Preview is available for free, but is aimed at web developers and advanced users.
- It can be installed alongside the standard [[Safari]] browser as it is a separate application rather than a [[TestFlight]] version of [[Safari]].
- The app is updated approximately bi-weekly.
- Includes support for [[Shortcuts]].

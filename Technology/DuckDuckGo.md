# Overview
DuckDuckGo is a search engine designed to prioritise user privacy and deliver search results without tracking your activities. It offers an alternative to more mainstream search engines by emphasising data security and anonymity, making it ideal for users concerned about surveillance and data collection. DuckDuckGo can be useful for everyday web searches, research tasks, and accessing information while ensuring that users' search histories are not tracked or stored.

# Features
- **Privacy** - Prevents search tracking and profiling to maintain anonymity, and does not store personal information, search history, or IP addresses.
- **Bang Searches** - Directly search over 13,000 websites using shortcuts called "Bangs" (e.g., `!w` for Wikipedia).
- **Enforced HTTPS** - Redirects to the encrypted version of sites wherever possible for secure browsing.
- **Tracker Blocking** - Blocks hidden third-party trackers on websites for enhanced privacy.
- **Email Protection** - Offers @duck.com aliases to shield personal email addresses from trackers.

# Notes
- Completely free to use and supports donations, though it is sustained by revenue from their minimalist ads.

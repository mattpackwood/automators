# Overview
Stage Manager is a system feature for iPadOS and macOS. It allows users to manage multiple open windows and applications on their devices. It does this by providing a 'centralised hub' where users can view, switch between, and organise their open windows.

Stage Manager effectively enables users to create virtual desktop spaces, each with its own set of windows and applications. This feature is intended to help users  better organise their workflow and multitask more effectively by separating different projects/tasks into distinct spaces. With Stage Manager, users can quickly arrange windows side by side for comparison or reference, and easily rearrange windows to suit their preferences. Additionally, Stage Manager provides a high level view of all open windows, making it easier to locate and access specific applications or content.

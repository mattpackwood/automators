# Overview
Logitech Harmony is a line of universal remote controls created by [[Logitech]]. The goal of these remotes is to streamline and simplify the process of managing multiple electronic devices in your home, such as TVs, audio systems, streaming devices, and more. Instead of using a separate remote for each device, a Logitech Harmony remote allows you to control everything with a single device.

Harmony remotes come in various models, including both basic models and more advanced versions with touch screens and additional features. They can be programmed to recognise and control thousands of different devices from a wide range of manufacturers.

# How It Works
## Device Compatibility
Logitech Harmony remotes are designed to work with a vast array of electronic devices, from older models to the latest tech. The remote communicates with these devices via infrared ([[IR]]) signals, just like most individual remotes do. For later models, particularly those in the *Harmony Elite* series, they can also communicate via [[Bluetooth]] and WiFi.

## Activity-Based Control
One of the standout features of Logitech Harmony remotes has been their activity-based control system. Instead of controlling each device separately, you can set up "Activities" that group multiple actions together. For example, you can create an "Activity" called "Watch Movie" that turns on your TV, sets your audio system to the correct input, and starts your DVD playerâ€”all with a single button press.

## Setup and Programming
Setting up a Logitech Harmony remote typically involves using a companion app available for computers and mobile devices. During setup, you input the brand and model of each device you want to control, and the app guides you through creating Activities and customising the remote's buttons. The app then syncs the configuration to the remote.

# Types of Logitech Harmony Remotes
## Basic Models
These are simpler, more affordable remotes that provide basic universal control. They usually have standard buttons and are programmed using a computer.

## Advanced Models
Advanced models feature touch screens, voice control, and expand their control options to smart home devices through platforms like [[Amazon Alexa]] and [[Google Assistant]]. These models generally offer more extensive customisation options for both Activities and individual device control.

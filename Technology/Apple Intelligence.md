# Overview
Introduced at [[WWDC]] 2024 for a 2025 launch, Apple Intelligence is [[Apple|Apple's]] branded platform for the implementation of [[artificial intelligence]] on [[Apple|Apple's]] platforms. It includes provision for both on-device processing, offloading to processing in a secure [[Apple]] Hosted server environment, or out to third party services, [[OpenAI]] and its [[ChatGPT]] product being the first offering, but with the door open to bring aboard others.

# Features

## Coding
Much like [[Github Copilot]], Apple Intelligence will provide developer support for predictive code completion for [[Swift]], from within the [[Xcode]] app.

## Genmoji
Apple Intelligence brings new image generation functionality and building on the use of [[Memoji]], [[Genmoji]] pictographs can be used by users in e-mails, messages, etc. The [[Genmoji]] are non-photo realistic, simple images in a [[Memoji]] styles, that are generated from text input by the user.

## Image Playground
Another area for image generation by Apple Intelligence is via the [[Image Playground]] app. The user can enter a description 

## Mail
Apple Intelligence will be used to optionally triage a user's inbox based on a derivation of a priority of each mail. This is comparable to the same sort of feature offered by many third party e-mail apps and services.

## Photos
Apple Intelligence is to create thematic story-based videos comprising of snippets of existing videos and images. It is intended to be a step-up from the previous memories videos that created videos based purely on time bound collections of content.

## Siri
Apple Intelligence will come to underpin interactions with [[Apple|Apple's]] virtual assistant, [[Siri]]. Apple intelligence is expected to utilise more localised content to help in assigning context as well as providing a more natural and conversational interaction through improved [[natural language processing]].

## Writing
Apple Intelligence brings tooling to support writing using typical generative AI tooling to allow for generation (from a prompt), summarisation, rewriting, and proofing.

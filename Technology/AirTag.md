# Overview
[[Apple\|Apple's]] AirTags are small, coin-shaped devices designed to help you track and find your personal items like keys, wallets, or bags. They are part of [[Apple\|Apple's]] ecosystem and work using [[Bluetooth]] technology to communicate with nearby [[Apple]] devices. When you misplace an item with an AirTag attached, you can use the [[Find My]] app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to locate it. If the item is nearby, your device will guide you to its exact location using onscreen directions. If it's further away, you can put it in "Lost Mode", allowing other [[Apple]] devices to anonymously detect it and update its location on your [[Find My]] app.

An AirTag is designed to be minimal yet functional. It has a replaceable battery that lasts up to a year and is water and dust resistant. Each AirTag has a built-in speaker that can play sounds to help you find it. They are small enough to be attached to many everyday items.

# How AirTags Work
AirTags primarily use [[Bluetooth]] to connect with nearby [[Apple]] devices. When an AirTag is within the Bluetooth range of an Apple device, it communicates with it securely, sharing its location data. This data is then sent to [[iCloud]], and you can view the location of your AirTag on the [[Find My]] app.

To help find items that are out of [[Bluetooth]] range, AirTags leverage [[Apple\|Appleâ€™s]] [[Find My]] network. This network consists of millions of [[Apple]] devices globally that can detect [[Bluetooth]] signals from lost AirTags and send the location data anonymously back to the owner.

# Privacy and Security
[[Apple]] has implemented several security features to protect your an AirTag user's privacy. Location data and history are kept private and encrypted, and only you can see where your AirTag is. If someone else's AirTag happens to be in your belongings, your [[Apple]] device will alert you to its presence if it's traveling with you for an extended period, preventing unwanted tracking.

Additionally, AirTags have anti-stalking measures. If you have an iOS device and someone tries to track you with an AirTag, your device will alert you, ensuring you're aware of any AirTags that might not belong to you in your vicinity.

# Setting Up AirTags
Setting up AirTags is designed to be simple and intuitive. When you unbox your AirTag, you bring it near to your iPhone, and a setup pop-up will appear, similar to pairing AirPods. You can then assign it to an item and name it (e.g., "Keys" or "Backpack"). Once set up, you can see its status and location in the [[Find My]]  app's items listing.

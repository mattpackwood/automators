# Overview
The Dataview plugin for [[Obsidian]] is a community plugin enables [[Obsidian]] users to create and manage dynamic data views within their notes. This plugin effectively allows users to organise, visualise, and manipulate structured data, turning their notes into powerful databases for better knowledge management.

# Features
- Create custom queries and data tables within notes
- Display data in various formats such as tables, lists, tasks, and calendars
- Filter and sort data based on specific criteria
- Calculate and aggregate values from data sets

# Notes
- Dataview queries can be constructed in the *Dataview Query Language* (DQL), a [[SQL]] like language, or [[JavaScript]] using *Dataview JS*.
- DQL can be expressed in a code block or as inline code.

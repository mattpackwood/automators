# Overview
AirPlay is a wireless streaming protocol created by [[Apple]]. It is designed to enable users to stream audio, video, and other content from [[Apple]] devices (such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs) to compatible receivers like [[Apple TV|Apple TVs]], [[HomePod|HomePods]], and other supported devices. The primary purpose of AirPlay is to provide a simple and seamless way to share media across different devices in the same network, and make it easy to play content on larger screens and/or better speakers.

# AirPlay
AirPlay was first introduced in 2010 as part of iOS 4.2. This first iteration of AirPlay enabled users to broadcast content from [[Apple]] devices to [[Apple TV ]]and AirPlay-enabled speakers. AirPlay works over Wi-Fi, which means both the sending and receiving devices need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. The protocol supports a variety of media types, including:

- **Audio:** High-quality music streaming.
- **Video:** High-definition video streaming.
- **Photos:** Wireless photo sharing.

# AirPlay 2
AirPlay 2, introduced in 2018 with iOS 11.4, expanded on the original AirPlay, bringing several new features and improvements:

- **Multi-Room Audio:** Users can play audio in multiple rooms simultaneously, controlling all the speakers individually or as a group.
- **Improved Buffering:** Enhanced buffering techniques result in more stable streaming, even in environments with less robust Wi-Fi.
- **HomeKit Integration:** AirPlay 2-capable devices can be integrated into [[Apple Home|Apple’s HomeKit]] for more advanced home automation and control.
- **Multi-User Control:** Multiple users can add songs to a shared queue, making it easier to enjoy collaborative playlists.
- **Siri Integration:** Users can control AirPlay 2-enabled devices using [[Siri]].

# Using Airplay
1. Users can start AirPlay by tapping the AirPlay icon in supported apps or through [[Control Centre]] on their [[Apple]] device.
2. Once the icon is tapped, a list of available AirPlay devices appears. Users simply select the desired device to start streaming.
3. The media is then wirelessly transmitted from the source device to the target device.

# Third Party Support for AirPlay
[[Apple]] has licensed AirPlay technology to various third-party companies, expanding its ecosystem. Numerous smart TVs, speakers, and AV receivers from brands like Sony, Samsung, LG, and Sonos have built-in support for AirPlay 2. This allows users to stream content from their [[Apple]] devices to a broader range of products, not just [[Apple|Apple’s]] own hardware.

# AirPlay on Other Operating Systems
While AirPlay is a technology developed by [[Apple]], there have been several efforts to bring AirPlay functionality to non-[[Apple]] ecosystems. Some notable projects include:

- [Shairport Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync)
	- An open-source implementation of an AirPlay server that enables Linux-based operating systems to receive audio streams (only) via AirPlay.
- [AirServer](https://www.airserver.com)
	- A commercial solution offering AirPlay support for Windows and Mac, allowing these computers to receive media streams from [[Apple]] devices.

These projects enhance the usability and flexibility of AirPlay by making it accessible on a variety of platforms beyond [[Apple|Apple's]] ecosystem, broadening the technology’s reach and utility.

# Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially computer systems. It involves the ability to learn from experiences, understand languages, recognise patterns, solve problems, and make decisions. AI can be divided into different categories based on their capabilities and functionalities.

# Types of Artificial Intelligence
AI can be categorised into various types, each with different levels of capability. The seven primary types of AI can be arranged both in terms of functionality and intelligence levels. 

## Capability Basis
### 1. Narrow AI
Also known as "Weak AI" of "Narrow AI" is designed for a narrow, specific task. It can perform such specific tasks very well but lacks general intelligence. Examples include chatbots, recommendation systems, and virtual assistants.

### 2. General AI
Also called "Strong AI" or "Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI), General AI possesses the capability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human being. It remains largely theoretical to date has not been proven.

### 3. Superintelligent AI
This type of AI surpasses human intelligence and capability. It would outperform humans in every aspect, including creativity, problem-solving, decision-making, and emotional intelligence. This concept is more speculative and a topic of extensive debate and concern.

## Functionality Basis
### 4. Reactive Machines
These are the most basic types of AI systems, which can only react to current scenarios without any memory of past experiences. An example is IBMâ€™s Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer that beat the world champion Garry Kasparov.

### 5. Limited Memory
These AI systems can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Self-driving cars are a notable example, as they observe the world around them and make driving decisions based on that information and past experiences.

### 6. Theory of Mind
This type of AI understands emotions, beliefs, intentions, and can interact socially. It refers to machines that could understand and attribute mental states to themselves and others. Although progress is being made, this level of AI is still largely conceptual.

### 7. Self-Aware AI
The most advanced form of AI, it possesses a sense of self and consciousness. These machines would have awareness and understanding of their existence and surroundings. This type of AI does not currently exist and is purely theoretical.

# History of Artificial Intelligence
- **1950s**
	- The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in a paper for the 1956 Dartmouth conference
	- Early research focused on problem-solving and symbolic methods.
- **1960s-1970s**: 
	- Development of the first AI programs, which could perform tasks but with limited capabilities.
- **1980s**: 
	- Emergence of expert systems that emulated the decision-making ability of humans.
- **1990s**: 
	- Breakthroughs included IBM's Deep Blue defeating a world chess champion.
- **2000s-Present**: 
	- Rapid advancements due to big data, enhanced computational power, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. 
	- AI technology adopted into use in everyday applications and industries.

# Example Uses of Artificial Intelligence
- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases, personalising treatment plans, predicting patient outcomes through data analysis.
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, risk management, algorithmic trading, personalised customer services.
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles, traffic management systems for reducing congestion.
- **Retail**: Personalised shopping experiences, inventory management, customer service chatbots.
- **Entertainment**: Content recommendation systems, game development, virtual reality.
- **Education**: Personalised tutoring, grading assistance, predictive analytics for student performance.

# Overview
Microsoft Word is a leading desktop word processing application that has been one of the core applications in Microsoft's office suite.

It is available on both Windows and Mac, and has utilised both [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA), as well as [[AppleScript]] for automation. Word is also available on mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads, as well as online via a browser, though these versions are somewhat more limited than the desktop version.

Word utilises an [[XML]]-based file format and can be extended through a plugin architecture utilising what are known as *add-ons*.

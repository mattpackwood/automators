# Overview
Workflow is the pre-cursor to [[Shortcuts|Apple Shortcuts]], and provided a way to automate actions on iPhones and iPads - "*Powerful automation made simple*". The application was released in late 2014 and won an Apple Design Award (for accessibility) in 2015. It was originally conceived and prototyped at a University of Michigan MHacks event and the subsequent preview released on YouTube garnered a lot of attention from the indie Apple media outlets.

The application was based around a feature known as the *content graph*. This feature provided Workflow with a processing engine that allowed things to be converted from one type to another. Images to PDFs, Markdown text to HTML or rich text, etc. Combined with [[URL Schemes]], and conditional logic this allowed end users to build sophisticated inter-app workflows.

The application used an [[Automator]]-like drag & drop block-based linear approach to build the workflows. These workflows could be saved to file, or shared via a URL. The ability to easily share workflows quickly lead to a the formation of an online community where people would share workflows and support others in building them.

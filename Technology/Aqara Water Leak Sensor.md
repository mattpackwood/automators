# Overview
The Aqara Water Leak Sensor is a small, wireless device designed to detect water leaks in your home and alert you to their presence. Its primary purpose is to help you prevent water damage by providing an early warning system for leaks or flooding. It's part of the larger [[Aqara]] smart home ecosystem, which includes various sensors and devices to enhance home security and automation.

The Aqara Water Leak Sensor operates using a pair of metal probes at the bottom of the device. When these probes come into contact with water, they complete an electrical circuit, signalling the presence of moisture. This triggers the sensor to send an alert to your connected smart home system, such as a smartphone app or home hub.

When the sensor detects water, it will send a notification to your smart home system. Depending on your setup, this could be a push notification to your phone, an email, or even an automated response like shutting off a water valve if you have advanced automation in place.

# Integration
The Aqara Water Leak Sensor can integrate with various smart home ecosystems beyond [[Aqara]]. Popular integrations include [[HomeKit|Apple HomeKit]], [[Google Assistant]], and [[Amazon Alexa]]. This allows for greater flexibility and control, enabling you to create comprehensive automation rules and scenes.

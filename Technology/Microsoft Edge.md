# Notes
- Microsoft Edge is a free application.
- It utilises the [[Chromium]] rendering engine on all platforms (other than iOS/iPadOS where it uses [[WebKit]]), but originally used the [[EdgeHTML]] rendering engine on its now legacy version of the browser..
	- As per the [January 2024 European ruling](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/), future updates may see Microsoft bring Edge using [[Blink]] to iOS/iPadOS, though there is a good chance this will be linked to any work [[Google]] might do in this area based on their own [[Google Chrome]] browser, built on the same [[Chromium]] base as Edge.

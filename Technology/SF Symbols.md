# Overview
SF Symbols is a set of hundreds of icons designed by [[Apple]] for developers to use in their apps. These symbols are designed to be consistent with the overall visual language of [[Apple|Apple's]] operating systems, with the basic intention of making it easier for developers to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces. 

Symbols can be drawn with different colours to match an app's design aesthetic, and some symbols come in multiple weights for the outline.

# Notes
- SF Symbols are vector-based, meaning they can be scaled up to any size and retain clarity (no pixellation).
- The symbols were designed to look good with the San Francisco font - hence the "SF" in SF Symbols.
- The licensing around the symbols is something to be aware of. You cannot just create icons based on the symbols and distribute them for example.

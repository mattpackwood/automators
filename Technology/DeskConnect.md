# Overview
DeskConnect by [[DeskConnect Inc]] was a multi-platform solution for transferring content between devices. This pre-dated [[AirDrop]] and initially was actually considered to work more reliably than Air Drop.

Each device would run a client application and a connection via a cloud service would be established that allowed test, URLs and images to be quickly transferred between devices.

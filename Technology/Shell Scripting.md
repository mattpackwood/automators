# Overview
Shell scripting is a powerful tool used in computing to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows. It involves writing a series of commands in a script file that can be executed by the [[shell]] interpreter.

Shell scripts can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as managing files and directories, running programs, and performing system maintenance. They can also be used to automate complex processes, saving time and reducing the risk of human error.

One of the key benefits of shell scripting is its versatility - it can be used on any operating system that supports a shell, such as Linux, Unix, or macOS. Additionally, shell scripts are highly customisable and can be tailored to suit individual needs and preferences.

# Key Components of Shell Scripting
- **Variables**: 
	- \Variables are used to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated within a script.
- **Control Structures**: 
	- Control structures such as loops and conditional statements allow for the execution of specific commands based on certain conditions.
- **Functions**: 
	- Functions provide a way to group related commands together, making scripts more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Input and Output**: 
	- Shell scripts can interact with users through input prompts and display output messages for feedback.
- **File Handling**: 
	- Shell scripts can manipulate files and directories, including creating, copying, moving, and deleting files.

# Advanced Topics in Shell Scripting
- **Regular Expressions**: 
	- [[Regular expressions]] provide a powerful way to search and manipulate text within a script.
- **Error Handling**: 
	- Error handling mechanisms can be implemented to gracefully handle unexpected situations within a script.
- **Debugging**: 
	- Techniques for debugging shell scripts, such as adding print statements and using debugging tools, can help identify and fix issues.
- **Security**: 
	- Best practices for secure shell scripting, including proper handling of user input and sensitive data, can help protect against vulnerabilities.

# Overview
ChatGPT is a type of [[artificial intelligence ]](AI) developed by [[OpenAI]]. It uses a machine learning technique called a "transformer" to understand and generate human-like responses in natural language. Essentially, ChatGPT can carry on conversations with people about various topics, answer questions, and even provide help with tasks like writing and learning.

# How It Works
ChatGPT is built on a specific model architecture known as a GPT, which stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer". 

1. **Training Data**
	- ChatGPT is trained on a massive dataset comprising text from books, websites, and other sources. This helps the model learn the patterns of human language.
2. **Learning Patterns**
	- During training, ChatGPT learns to predict the next word in a sentence, which enables it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
3. **User Interaction**
	- When a user types a message or asks a question, ChatGPT analyses the input and generates a response based on the patterns it's learned during its training.

# Considerations on Use
There are a handful of considerations that anyone using ChatGPT should take into consideration.

- **Accuracy**
	- ChatGPT's responses are based on its training data, which may not always be up-to-date or accurate.
	- Extreme deviations are possible and are often referred to as "hallucinations".
- **Bias**
	- ChatGPT can reflect biases present in the data it was trained on.
- **Context**
	- ChatGPT can generate responses that are off-topic or don't fully understand complex context.

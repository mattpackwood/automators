# Overview
A KVM Switch (Keyboard, Video, Mouse Switch) is a piece of hardware that allows a user to control multiple computers using a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse. This becomes especially handy in environments where there are many computers but limited space for separate peripherals for each one.

The main purpose of a KVM switch is to streamline operations and save space. Instead of having multiple keyboards, mice, and monitors cluttering up a workspace, a user can neatly switch control between different computers with just one set of peripherals.

# How They Work
A typical KVM switch has multiple input ports and one set of output ports. The input ports are where you connect the keyboard, monitor, and mouse that you want to share among the computers. The output ports are connected to the various computers you wish to control. When you want to switch control from one computer to another, you can usually do this by pressing a button on the KVM switch or using a key combination on the keyboard. 

Some KVM switches may also have the option to switch using a remote or even a dedicated on computer utility.

# Types

## USB and PS/2 KVM Switches
- **USB KVM Switches**
	- These switches use USB connections for the keyboard and mouse. 
- **PS/2 KVM Switches**
	- These are older switches that use PS/2 connections for the keyboard and mouse. 
	- Due to the age of the technology, these only tend to be found on old specialist system setups.

## HDMI, DVI, and VGA KVM Switches
- **HDMI KVM Switches** - Ideal for high-definition video outputs, typically used in most computer systems these days.
- **DVI KVM Switches** - Often found in professional and business environments that require high-quality video output.
- **VGA KVM Switches** - Suitable for older computer models and setups where high-resolution video is not necessary.

## Single and Multi-Monitor KVM Switches
- **Single Monitor KVM Switches**: These are the most basic types, allowing control of multiple computers via a single monitor setup.
- **Multi-Monitor KVM Switches**: These are more advanced and allow users to control multiple computers that use dual or multiple monitor setups.

# Benefits

- **Space and Units** - Reduces the number of peripherals needed and the costs of multiple units vs the cost of the KVM switch.
- **Convenience** - Makes it easy to switch between different computer systems without having to physically move between workstations.
- **Productivity** - Streamlines workflow, particularly in environments where multitasking across multiple computers is required.

# Challenges

- **Compatibility Issues** - Some KVM switches may not be compatible with specific hardware or operating systems.
- **Latency** - In almost all cases, there will be delay when switching between computers.
- **Complex Setup**: Initial setup can sometimes be complex, especially for larger KVM implementations.

# Overview
The Stream Deck by Elgato is a versatile hardware (or software) solution tailored for streamers, content creators, and professional users looking to streamline their workflow and enhance their productivity. It consists of a customisable deck of tactile, programmable buttons that can be configured to perform various tasks with a single press.

The Stream Deck allows users to create custom shortcuts for actions such as launching programs, adjusting audio levels, switching scenes in a live stream, controlling camera settings, and more. With support for macros, multi-action sequences, and integration with popular streaming platforms like [[Twitch]], [[YouTube]], and [[OBS Studio]], the Stream Deck empowers users to simplify complex tasks and focus on creating high-quality content.

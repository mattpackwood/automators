# Overview
The Templater community plugin for [[Obsidian]] allows users to create and reuse templates within their notes, making it easier to structure and format information consistently. This plugin is particularly useful for users who want to streamline their note-taking process and maintain a cohesive organisation system.

# Features
- Ability to define custom templates for notes
- Supports variables within templates for dynamic content insertion
- Support for dynamic templates that are evaluated on each view - e.g. current date
- Powerful templating language with conditional logic and looping

# Notes
- The templating engine uses [[JavaScript]] objects and functions.

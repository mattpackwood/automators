# Overview
The Nintendo Switch is a popular video game console developed by Nintendo. Released in March 2017, it was unique to the market because it combined the features of a home console with the portability of a handheld device, making it a versatile choice for gamers.

# Design and Features
## Original Model
The console itself is a wide controller-like device with a central 6.2-inch LCD touchscreen. The original model Switch has a modular design with detachable controllers called "Joy-Cons" that can be attached to either side of the tablet or used remotely. This allows for multiple gaming styles: handheld mode, TV mode, and table-top mode.

- **Handheld Mode** - The Joy-Cons are attached to the sides of the tablet, making it similar to a traditional portable gaming device.
- **TV Mode** - The console can be placed into a docking station that connects to a TV, allowing for a more traditional home console experience.
- **Tabletop Mode** - The tablet has a built-in kickstand, allowing it to be propped up on a flat surface. The Joy-Cons can be detached and used wirelessly.

Since the original release two other Switch models have been released, and OLED and a Lite model.

## OLED Model
The OLD model includes a larger 7 inch OLED display (same 1280x720 resolution) over the original, double the storage (64 GB), and a dock with a LAN port.

## Switch Lite
The Switch Lite is a cheaper alternative to the original, and foregoes the modularity of the original with a single handheld mode unit with integrated controls. It features a smaller 5.5 inch screen same (again, the same 1280x720 resolution), and also lacks the infrared motion camera and rumble feedback of the other models.

# Gaming
- The console supports physical game cartridges as well as digital downloads from [the Nintendo eShop](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop). 
- The Switch offers local multiplayer gaming using multiple Joy-Cons or even multiple Switch consoles. 
- For online play, Nintendo provides a subscription-based service called Nintendo Switch Online that allows for online multiplayer gaming, access to a library of classic games, cloud saves, and special offers.

# Overview
The Aqara Cube is an innovative smart home control device designed to interact seamlessly with [[Aqara|Aqara's]] ecosystem of smart products and other compatible devices. Unlike traditional remote controls, the Aqara Cube uses motion and orientation to send commands, making it a novel and potentially intuitive way to manage your smart home.

The Aqara Cube employs an array of sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, to detect its orientation and motion. This data is then wirelessly transmitted to a connected hub, which interprets the gestures and executes the corresponding commands. By performing specific gestures such as flipping, shaking, rolling, or rotating the Aqara Cube, you can trigger various smart home actions. For example, flipping the Aqara Cube to side 4 might turn on the lights, while rotating it could control a smart speaker's volume.

# Gestures
The Aqara Cube can recognise a variety of gestures, including but not limited to:

- **Flip**: Turn the Cube to a different side.
- **Shake**: Shake the Cube back and forth.
- **Rotate**: Spin the Cube along its axis.
- **Tap**: Gently knock the Cube on a surface.
- **Push**: Slide the Cube slightly on a table.
- **Tilt**: Incline the Cube to a certain angle.

Each gesture can be customised to perform specific actions within your smart home setup, offering an interactive and tactile approach to smart home management.

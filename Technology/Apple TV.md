# Overview
Apple TV is a digital media player developed by Apple. It allows users to stream content like movies, TV shows, music, and even play games on their televisions. The device connects to a TV via an HDMI cable and uses the Internet to fetch media from various streaming services.

The primary purpose of Apple TV is to provide an all-in-one entertainment hub, simplifying the way users access and manage their digital content. It is controlled by a remote (physical or app/OS feature), although it can also be navigated using the Apple TV app on an iPhone or iPad.

# Features
- Apple TV supports a wide range of streaming services - e.g. Netflix, [[Amazon Prime]] Video, Disney+, Apple TV+, BBC iPlayer.
- Apple TV comes with an App Store, allowing users to download various apps and games.
- Apple TV includes support for [[Siri]].
- [[[[AirPlay]]]] is a feature that allows content from iPhones, iPads, and Macs to be mirrored or sent directly to Apple TV. 

# Notes
- Apple TV runs on tvOS, a specialised operating system derived from iOS. It is designed to provide a user-friendly experience on larger screens. It supports background apps running automatic updates, and the usual interactive TV features you might expect from any smart TV or box.
- Apple TV can act as a central hub for [[Apple Home]]. This allows users to control [[HomeKit]]-enabled devices such as lights, thermostats, and cameras directly from their TV or remotely through the Home app.

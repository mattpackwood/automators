# Overview
The SwitchBot Curtain Opener is a [[SwitchBot]] smart home device designed to automate the opening and closing of your curtains. The basic operation of the SwitchBot Curtain Opener involves attaching a small motorised unit to the curtain rail or rod. This unit then connects wirelessly to your phone via [[Bluetooth]] or Wi-Fi, allowing you to control it remotely. You can also schedule the curtains to open or close at specific times, which is particularly useful for improving home security or optimising natural light.

# Overview
Jellycuts is an application that allows you to write [[Shortcuts]] shortcuts from a text-based coding language. This is often viewed as an easier way to manage complex shortcuts as manipulating text is often easier to do than manipulating visual code blocks in [[Shortcuts]], particularly for those familiar with traditional text-based development languages.

# Operating Systems
- iOS
- iPadOS

# Features
- [[Syntax Highlighting]].
- Import from/export to [[Shortcuts]].
- In-app documentation.
- Bespoke actions.
- Support for functions and macros.
- Jellycuts Pro provides additional actions, [[Visual Studio Code]] integration via "*Jellycuts Bridge*", additional power tools, and editor personalisation.

# Notes
- Jellycuts is available as a free download with a tiered pay what you like (in-app purchase) for the Jellycuts Pro features.
- Originally created by [[Zachary Lineman]].
- An Open Source version of Jellycuts is available via [Open Jelly](https://github.com/OpenJelly) on [[GitHub]].
- Jellycuts transferred to Skyground Media Inc, the owners of [[RoutineHub]] in 2024.

# Notes  
- Discord is a purely online solution.
- Discord operated a freemium model, with optional paid features Nitro and Server Boosts.
	- Nitro (and Nitro Basic) is a subscription plan for an individual to increase the breadth of what they can do on Discord servers. It effectively gives you a premium upgrade to be ing a VIP so you can use more emoji, get better video quality when streaming, etc.
	- Server Boosts are tokens a Nitro user may donate to a particular instance (server). These boosts add up, and can give a server a level up such that more and more feature enhancements are added to the server.
- Benefits from a large selection of community-developed bots and enhancements.

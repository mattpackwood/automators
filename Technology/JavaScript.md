# Overview
JavaScript is a versatile and popular programming language commonly used for web development. Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript is primarily used to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behaviour to websites. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web browser rather than on the server. It has also slowly become a lingua franca for creating automations in many leading apps on Apple's operating systems as those operating systems bundle the core JavaScript library into the systems.

JavaScript is known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it an essential tool for creating interactive web applications, animations, and games. It works seamlessly with HTML and CSS, forming the foundation of modern web development.

JavaScript supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It features event-driven programming, allowing for the execution of code in response to user interactions or system events.

Key features of JavaScript include its dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object-oriented programming. JavaScript also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that simplify complex web development tasks.

# Syntax
- JavaScript syntax is similar to C-style languages, with key components such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- It uses curly braces `{}` to define code blocks and semicolons `;` to terminate statements. 
- JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning `myVar` and `MyVar` would be treated as different variables.

# Data Types
JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and functions. It is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types during runtime. Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming and data manipulation in JavaScript.

# DOM Manipulation
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects. JavaScript can manipulate the DOM dynamically, allowing developers to change content, styles, and interactions on a web page. Understanding DOM manipulation is fundamental for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

# Asynchronous Programming
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. Asynchronous programming techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await allow developers to handle tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread. This is essential for managing network requests, animations, and other time-consuming operations in web applications.

# Notes
- JavaScript is an [[ECMAScript]] standard.
- JavaScript is very different to the Java programming language, but both appeared in the same era leading to some confusion. The name 'JavaScript' was chosen to present JavaScript as a companion tool to Java; e.g. JavaScript at the client-side in the browser and Java on the backend servers.
- [[Node.js]] is runtime engine to run JavaScript outside of the browser that is hugely popular.

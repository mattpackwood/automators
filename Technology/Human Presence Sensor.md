# Overview
A Human Presence Sensor is a type of sensor designed to detect the presence of a person in a specific area. These sensors are widely used in various applications, from home automation systems to workplace security and beyond. Their primary function is to recognise when a human is nearby and trigger an appropriate response, such as turning on lights, activating a display, or sending alerts.

Human Presence Sensors typically use technologies such as infrared (IR), ultrasonic waves, microwave signals, or cameras to identify the presence of a person. These different technologies contribute to the reliability and accuracy of detection under various conditions.

- **Infrared Sensors** - detect the heat emitted by human bodies. 
	- Since humans emit infrared radiation, these sensors can sense changes in temperature and determine if a person is present. 
	- They are commonly used in devices like motion-activated lights. 
	- The most commonly encountered type is often referred to as PIR sensors - Passive Infrared.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors** - emit high-frequency sound waves that bounce off objects and return to the sensor. 
	- By measuring the time it takes for the sound waves to return, the sensor can determine if there is a person in the area. 
	- These sensors are useful in environments where infrared sensors might struggle, such as areas with varying temperatures.
- **Microwave Sensors** - operate similarly to ultrasonic sensors, but they use microwave pulses instead of sound waves.
	- These sensors can detect motion through various materials, making them effective in scenarios where other types of sensors might be obstructed.
	- These gained popularity for smart home use in 2022/3.
	- They are also referred to as "millimetre wave" sensors as the microwaves used have a millimetre scaled wavelength.
- **Camera-Based Sensors** - use visual data to detect human presence. 
	- These sensors can analyse video feeds to recognise human shapes and movements. 
	- While more complex and requiring more processing power, they are highly accurate and can even provide detailed information about the number and behaviour of people present.

# Applications
## Home Automation
Human Presence Sensors are popularly used in smart homes to automate lighting, heating, and security systems. When someone enters a room, the lights can turn on automatically, and when the room is empty, the lights can turn off to save energy.

## Office and Commercial Buildings
In offices, these sensors help manage energy consumption by turning off lights and electronic devices in unoccupied rooms. They can also enhance security by monitoring areas for unauthorised access.

## Healthcare
In healthcare settings, Human Presence Sensors can monitor patients, especially those who may need assistance. The sensors can alert staff if a patient moves or leaves their bed, providing immediate assistance.

## Retail and Public Spaces
Retail stores use these sensors to track customer movements, optimising store layouts and product placements. In public spaces, the sensors can help manage lighting and facilities based on occupancy, enhancing both safety and convenience.

# Challenges and Considerations

1. **False Positives/Negatives** - sensors may sometimes falsely detect presence or fail to detect actual presence, especially in environments with varying conditions.
2. **Privacy Concerns** - camera-based sensors, in particular, can raise privacy issues. It's important to handle and store sensor data responsibly.
3. **Environmental Factors** - the effectiveness of sensors can be influenced by environmental factors such as lighting, temperature, and obstructions.
4. **Cost** - high-quality sensors and advanced systems can be costly to install and maintain.

Human Presence Sensors are an integral part of modern smart systems, providing numerous benefits and practical applications across various fields. Understanding their operation and applications can help in making informed decisions about their implementation and use.

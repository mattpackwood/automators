# Overview
Siri is a virtual assistant developed by [[Apple]] Inc. that uses voice recognition and natural language processing to perform a variety of tasks on Apple devices. It was first introduced on the iPhone 4S in 2011 and has since been integrated into other Apple products such as the iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac computers.

Users can interact with Siri by speaking commands or asking questions, and Siri responds with spoken feedback or on-screen information. Siri can help with tasks like sending messages, setting reminders, making phone calls, searching the web, running [[Shortcuts|Shortcuts automations]] and controlling smart home devices.

Siri relies on machine learning algorithms to continuously improve its understanding of user queries and preferences. It can adapt to individual users over time, learning their habits and preferences to provide more personalised responses.

Overall, Siri is designed to make interacting with Apple devices more convenient and intuitive by enabling users to perform tasks using natural language commands.

# Voice Recognition
Voice recognition is the technology that enables Siri to understand and interpret spoken commands from users. It converts spoken words into text that can be processed by the device's software, allowing Siri to carry out the requested tasks.

# Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is the branch of artificial intelligence that enables Siri to understand the meaning behind user queries and commands. This technology allows Siri to interpret the context of a conversation and respond appropriately, even when the phrasing is not exact or conventional.

# Machine Learning
Siri uses machine learning algorithms to improve its accuracy and responsiveness over time. By analysing user interactions and feedback, Siri can continuously update its understanding of language patterns and user preferences, resulting in more accurate and relevant responses.

# Overview
Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language that was designed and developed in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It has gained popularity for its simplicity and readability, which made it an accessible option for beginners and with enough power to engage more experienced programmers.

# Uses
- Ruby is particularly suited for web development, thanks to powerful frameworks like the popular [[Ruby on Rails]]. 
- Ruby also works well for scripting, prototyping, and building applications in a variety of domains.

	# History
- Ruby was first released in 1995, drawing inspiration from [[Perl]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Eiffel]], [[Ada]], and [[Lisp]].
- The language gained popularity in the early 2000s with the release of [[Ruby on Rails]], a popular web application framework built using Ruby.

# Programming Structures Supported
- **Object-oriented programming:** 
	- Ruby allows developers to create classes and objects, making it easy to implement inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Functional programming:** 
	- Ruby supports functions as first-class citizens, allowing for higher-order functions, lambda functions, and closures.
- **Dynamic typing:** 
		- Ruby does not require variable declarations or explicit data types, making it flexible and easy to use.
- **Metaprogramming:**
	- Ruby has powerful [[metaprogramming]] capabilities, allowing developers to dynamically generate code at runtime.

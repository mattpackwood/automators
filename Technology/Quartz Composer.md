# Overview
Quartz Composer is a visual programming application developed by Apple, designed for processing and rendering graphical data. It allows users to create compositions by linking patches to manipulate images, video, and other media in real-time. The application is particularly useful for designers, artists, and developers looking to prototype user interfaceI elements, create live graphics, or build interactive visual effects.

# Operating Systems

# Features
- **Visual Programming Interface** - utilises a node-based approach for processing and rendering media.
- **Real-Time Rendering** - create and manipulate graphics in real-time.
- **Graphical Patches** - wide array of pre-built components for easier composition.
- **3D and 2D Graphics Support** - handle both 2D and 3D assets seamlessly.
- **Core Image, Video, and Audio Integration** - utilise powerful processing filters.
- **Custom Patches** - create custom patches (routines/steps) if built-in ones are insufficient.

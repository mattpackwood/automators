# Overview
IR is a shorthand term for "infrared", a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that has been used in home technology for decades to allow remote control of devices. An IR remote sends pulses of light to a receiver unit. The pulses usually encode some sort of fixed length alphanumeric code that the receiving unit then translates into an actionable command - e.g. to increase audio volume by one step.

Infrared radiation sometimes referred to as infrared light falls outside of the visible spectrum of electromagnetic waves that humans can perceive.

> [!Tip] Is My IR Remote Working?
> Take a digital cameras such as a SmartPhone's camera with a digital viewfinder. Point the cameras at the LED on your IR remote and hold down a button on the remote. The CMOS sensor in the camera can detect list pulses in the infrared spectrum and so if your IR remote is working, you *should* see the LED blinking when you view it in your camera's viewfinder. The camera is turning invisible infrared into something in your visible range.

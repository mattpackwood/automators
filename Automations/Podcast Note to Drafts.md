# Overview
This is a [[Shortcuts]] shortcut that the [[Overcast]] podcast app and allows you to take a time indexed note by dictation or typing (a link to the time index being included) and save it to [[Drafts]].  The shortcut will pause and restart the podcast after capturing the note, utilising [[Toolbox Pro]] actions to manage some of the audio querying.

# Notes
- This was an example shortcut [[Stephen Millard]] talked about on [[Mac Power Users]] [episode 656](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/656).
- This is a useful shortcut to tie to a back tap on your iPhone, or your action button.

# Description
This automation is for use with [[TextExpander]], and was triggered by David with a case sensitive trigger of `xnm`. It checks the recipient in the *To* field in your [[Apple Mail]] e-mail, and then using some [[AppleScript]], attempts to extract the first name of the recipient from the contact details. If there is a comma, it will take the second name, otherwise it will take the first name; the name being returned is pasted out by TextExpander.
# AppleScript
The following AppleScript code can be used in the TextExpander snippet, and was revised by [Greg Forcey](https://twitter.com/GregForcey), and shared back to David when it stopped working on a later version of macOS.

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Mail"
        tell text field "To:" of window 1
            if UI element 1 exists then
                set theToRecipient to (value of UI element 1)
                if ((count words of theToRecipient) is greater than 0) and (theToRecipient does not contain ",") then
                    return word 1 of theToRecipient
                else if ((count words of theToRecipient) is greater than 0) and (theToRecipient contains ",") then
                    return word 2 of theToRecipient
                end if
            end if
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
```

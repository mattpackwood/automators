This automation utilises [[AppleScript]], Apple's [[Mail]] app, and [[TextExpander]] to automatically populate a mail with a suitable first name intro when replying to an e-mail.

TextExpander is used to trigger the following AppleScript.

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Mail"
        tell text field "To:" of window 1
            if UI element 1 exists then
                set theToRecipient to (value of UI element 1)
                if ((count words of theToRecipient) is greater than 0) and (theToRecipient does not contain ",") then
                    return word 1 of theToRecipient
                else if ((count words of theToRecipient) is greater than 0) and (theToRecipient contains ",") then
                    return word 2 of theToRecipient
                end if
            end if
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
```

You can reuse the AppleScript by nesting it as a snippet in other snippets. The result can then be prefixed with your preferred salutation (e.g. "Dear", "Hi", "*{nothing}*").

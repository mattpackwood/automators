# Overview
Data serialisation refers to the process of converting complex sets of digital data (structures or objects) into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed. This format is typically a stream of bytes that can be written to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. 

Serialisation allows data to be converted into a standardised format that can be easily reconstructed back into its original form when needed. This process is essential for interoperability between different systems and programming languages, as it ensures that data can be exchanged and understood correctly by different applications.

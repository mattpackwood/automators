# Overview
Front matter is a section of a file that contains meta data or information about the file itself. In the context of computing, front matter is commonly used in document markup languages such as [[Markdown]] and [[YAML]]. It typically appears at the beginning of a document and is enclosed within special characters to distinguish it from the rest of the content.

Front matter can include various types of information, such as the title of the document, author information, date of creation, and any other relevant data. This meta data is important for organising and categorising documents, and can also be used for automated processing and formatting of content.

Front matter serves as a type of preamble to a document, providing essential information about the document's properties and context. It supports both humans and machines in understanding the purpose and structure of the document.

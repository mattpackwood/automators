# Overview
Camel case, also known as camelCase or camelCaps, is a naming convention in computer programming where multiple words are joined together without spaces, and each word, except the first one, begins with a capital letter. This style of naming is commonly used in programming languages.

**Examples**
- colourBlue
- myDogHasNoNose

# Origins of Camel Case
The term "camel case" is said to be derived from the hump-like appearance of the capital letters within the word, resembling the humps on a camel's back. It is also known as "mixedCase" due to the combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

# Benefits of Camel Case Naming

- **Readability**: Camel case makes it easier to read and understand compound words or phrases, especially in longer variable or function names when programming.
- **Consistency**: Using Camel case consistently throughout a codebase can improve code maintainability and make it easier for developers to navigate the code.
- **Convention**: Many programming languages and libraries have adopted Camel case as a standard naming convention, making it a familiar style for developers.

# Camel Case Variants

## Lower Camel Case
This is simply a more explicit term used to refer to Camel case.

## Upper Camel Case/Pascal Case
Upper Camel case, also known as PascalCase, is a variant of Camel case where the first letter of each word, including the first word, is capitalised.

# Overview
Metaprogramming is a programming technique that allows programs to treat themselves as data, enabling them to modify their own structure and behaviour at runtime. This can be achieved by writing code that writes or modifies other code during execution. Metaprogramming is commonly used in languages like [[Ruby]] to create dynamic, flexible, and concise code.

# Purpose of Metaprogramming
Metaprogramming is often used to reduce redundancy in code by dynamically generating code based on specific requirements. It allows developers to write more flexible and maintainable code by creating abstractions that can be reused in different contexts. Metaprogramming can also be used to define custom behaviours, extend language features, or improve performance in certain scenarios.

By leveraging metaprogramming, developers can write expressive and concise code that adapts to changing requirements, leading to more maintainable and extensible software solutions.

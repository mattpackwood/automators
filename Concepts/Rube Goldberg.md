# Overview
Rube Goldberg, a name nearly synonymous with complexity and creativity, represents both an individual and a concept. Rube Goldberg (1883-1970) was an American cartoonist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor. He is most famous for his cartoon series depicting elaborate, whimsical machines designed to perform simple tasks. These cartoon machines became so iconic that the term "*Rube Goldberg Machine*" is now used to describe any overly complicated apparatus that achieves a modest goal.

# Rube Goldberg
Reuben Garrett Lucius Goldberg, known simply as Rube Goldberg, was born in San Francisco in 1883. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Engineering in 1904. Initially working as an engineer for the city of San Francisco, Goldberg later pursued his passion for drawing and joined the San Francisco Chronicle as a sports cartoonist. His unique blend of engineering knowledge and artistic talent eventually led him to create the intricate and humorous cartoons that made him famous.

# Rube Goldberg Machine
A Rube Goldberg machine is an overly elaborate contraption designed to perform a simple task in a convoluted sequence of steps. These steps often rely on chain reactions reminiscent of domino effects, incorporating everyday objects and whimsical actions. The essence of a Rube Goldberg machine lies in its humorous, almost satirical portrayal of complexity.

## Key Characteristics
- **Overcomplexity:** The tasks performed are exceedingly simple, but the means to achieve them are extravagantly detailed.
- **Chain Reactions**: A sequence of related events where each action triggers the next.
- **Whimsical Elements**: Integration of humorous and often absurd components.

# Overview
Sherlocking is a term used to describe the practice undertaken by large platform developers of reproducing functionality in their own platform apps that is offered by a third party developer on their platform.

# History
The term "Sherlocking" gained popularity in the early 2000s when [[Apple]] introduced its own search tool called "[[Sherlock]]", which had similar features to a popular third-party app called "[[Watson]]" by [[Karelia Software]]. This incident sparked discussions about the ethics of a big tech company reproducing features from smaller developers. Since then, the term "Sherlocking" has been used to describe similar instances where [[Apple]] or other big tech companies replicate features from third-party apps.

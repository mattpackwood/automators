# Overview
The Steam Deck is a handheld gaming device developed by Valve Corporation, the creators of the popular game distribution platform, Steam. Its purpose is to provide a portable gaming experience that allows users to play their favourite PC games anywhere. The Steam Deck combines the power of a gaming PC with the convenience of a handheld console, offering a unique gaming experience on the go.

# Design and Features
The Steam Deck features a 7-inch touchscreen display, analogue joysticks, directional pads, and several buttons similar to traditional game controllers. It includes additional features such as customisable back buttons and trackpads for more precise control, which makes it somewhat unique compared to other handheld devices.

It runs on the SteamOS operating system, a Linux-based operating system optimised for a gaming experience. Through SteamOS, users can access their Steam library directly from the device. 

Valve has implemented a tool called Proton, which allows many Windows-based games to run seamless on Linux. Thus, many games that are available on Steam can be played on the Steam Deck, providing extensive compatibility for gamers.

Steam Decks also support USB C, [[Bluetooth]], and a MicroSD card slot for expanded storage.

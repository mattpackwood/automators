# Overview
Focused is a podcast hosted by David and Mike, two productivity enthusiasts who explore different aspects of productivity, time management, and personal development. The purpose of the podcast is to help listeners become more focused in their daily lives, whether it be through productivity techniques, organisation strategies, or mindset shifts.

In each episode, the hosts dive deep into a specific topic related to productivity, sharing their insights, experiences, and tips for improving focus and efficiency. From time blocking and task management to goal setting and overcoming distractions, covering a wide range of topics designed to help listeners optimise their work and personal lives. The podcast also explores deeper concepts like mindfulness, deep work, and work-life balance, offering practical advice and tools for listeners to apply to their own lives.

Aside from productivity techniques, the hosts also address head-on the common challenges that can hinder focus, such as procrastination, perfectionism, and burnout.

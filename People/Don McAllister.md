# About
Don McAllister was one of the first pioneers to enter into full-time podcasting, launching ScreenCastsONLINE as a hobby back in 2005. As he continued his journey on this path, Don made history by leading the way for other podcasters via introducing subscription based content and services through his platform - an incredible feat at that time! 

In addition to being an inspiring industry leader with ScreenCastsONLINE, Don has been part of various Mac related podcasts such as MacBreak Weekly, British Tech Mac and Mac & Forth along with making appearances onto stages including MacWorld, The New Media Expo and even mac-themed cruises like ‘MacMania’.

Don lives in the Merseyside area of the UK.

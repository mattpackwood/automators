# Sidequest
Regular [[Slack]] channels keep scrolling and scrolling. With Sidequest, your Slack app gains a new, persistent task overview. You can give each Slack workspace member a personal task inbox, and set up additional shared ticket inboxes in channels. These are great for IT, HR, infrastructure and other internal helpdesks. Sidequest will provide a shared understanding about the status of tasks so you'll no longer need to wonder: Is it done? Is it still pending? Who is looking after it? What's the deadline? When should we start working on it? Use the power of native Slack threads to communicate right inside tasks, creating a shared task history and reducing ambiguity.

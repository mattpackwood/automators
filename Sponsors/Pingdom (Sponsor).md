# Pingdom
Your website is the first impression you give to your customers. With Pingdom uptime and performance monitoring, youâ€™ll be the first to know when your website is down or if a transaction is slow or broken. 

Pingdom can also help you deliver a higher quality web experience using data from their real user monitoring service.

Test the availability of your websites, applications and services that are crucial to your organisation via Pingdom's network of 70+ probe servers worldwide, as often as every minute. When an incident happens, Pingdom alerts you immediately with all the information you need to resolve the issue quickly and confidently. 

Pingdom monitors much more than just whether your website is available: get alerted on error messages, HTTP status, content changes, and lots more. When your website becomes available again Pingdom's system will also notify you that all is well.

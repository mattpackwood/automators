# Pushcut
Pushcut is a powerful automation iOS/iPadOS utility free to download on the App Store. It allows you to trigger and receive notifications that can be tied into various automations.

> Pushcut helps you kick off your automation when it matters. Create fine-tuned interactions for HomeKit, Shortcuts, and custom workflows through smart notifications and widgets combined with powerful automation actions.
> 
> Use HomeKit scenes, shortcuts, online integrations, and web services as notification actions that pop up exactly when they matter to you. Trigger these smart notifications from Shortcuts, HomeKit, schedules, locations, iBeacons, online services (like IFTTT, Zapier, Flow, [[Make]], ...), home servers, or anywhere that knows what HTTP is.
> 
> Design beautiful custom widgets and display dynamic information that you can provide using Shortcuts actions, online services or our own API.

> Free version limits:
> - define up to 3 notifications
> - define up to 2 background actions
> - define up to 1 action per notification
> - use with local triggers or basic webhooks (no dynamic content or online actions)

For fewer limits and more features, you can subscribe to a monthly or annual subscription plan.

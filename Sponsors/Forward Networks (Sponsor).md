# Forward Networks
Mathematically-accurate network modelling trusted by the world's largest networks.

Here's what an always-accurate software copy of your entire network infrastructure can do for you:

> [!INFO] Search Your Entire Network
> Search network behavior, configuration and state network-wide with an intuitive and powerful tool. Find any device on your network, including its connections and all forwarding behavior for fast root-cause isolation and incident remediation. Perform complete end-to-end path analyses across your network for both on-prem and cloud infrastructure.

> [!INFO] Verify Network Intent
> Verify that your network is configured and behaving exactly as intended across on-prem, cloud, and virtual overlay networks. Set, check, and customize policies for your entire network. Continuously audit your network and receive alerts of non-compliance.

> [!INFO] Predict Network Behaviour
> Understand the outcome of network configuration changes for ACL and NAT environments. Proactively identify potential connectivity and security policy violations.

> [!INFO] Compare With Behaviour Diffs
> Behavior Diffs allow side-by-side comparison in one quick view of configuration file changes for any device, between any points in time.Identify what policy rules and behavior checks have changed between snapshots. Quickly see new device connections, topology changes and interface updates. Learn how routes are altered due to changes with the ability to filter results by VRF, next hop address, IP destination and more.

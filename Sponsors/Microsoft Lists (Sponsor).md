# Microsoft Lists
[[Microsoft Lists]] is a [[Microsoft 365]] app that helps you track information and organise work. List are simple, smart, and flexible, so you can stay on top of what matters most to your team. Track issues, assets, routines, contacts, inventory and more using customisable views and smart rules and alerts to keep everyone in sync. With ready-made templates, you can quickly start lists online, on our new mobile app, or with Microsoft Teams. And because it’s part of Microsoft 365, you can rely on enterprise-ready security and compliance.

Track what matters most. Make a list and let it flow.

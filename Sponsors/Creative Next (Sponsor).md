# Creative Next
Creative Next is a podcast about smart machines and the future of creative work.

>In the late 2010s there was a substantial focus in both popular and industry media on the emergence of truly useful artificial intelligence (AI). Thanks to the progress of commercialized technologies such as self-driving cars, AIs that defeat humans at the most complex strategy games, and the rise of deepfakes, coupled with a proliferation of thoughtful movies and shows like Her, Ex Machina, and Humans, AI became a common topic eliciting both excitement and fear. The Creative Next team became interested in its potential and wanted to better understand where AI was and where it would be going in the 2020s, a new decade about to dawn. Creative Next became our research project, shared with the world, to truly understand the present and future of AI.

>What we discovered was both mundane and exciting. Mundane, in that the realistic-seeming near-futures offered by popular culture were spectacularly unrealistic. We were nowhere near how we’ve been taught to think about the term AI for decades now, namely smart robots or synthetic humans or machines imbued with the spirit of humans. While there are projects that superficially seem to be going in this direction they are merely toys, things with a sheen of this magical superhuman AI but ultimately quite limited. Instead, we made an exciting discovery: the progress in AI was enabling significant innovations that, while they would not culminate in some new synthetic species or provide suitable human replacements, would create smart software offering meaningful power and convenience, particularly for the benefit of creative workers.

>Armed with this knowledge we sought the most progressive and interesting innovators working across fields and specialities: from musicians and artists, to architects and designers, to filmmakers and educators. Over three seasons and 36 episodes we interviewed the leaders who were making and using the best new tools in AI. We learned, together with our audience of thousands of listeners, that the near-term future of AI won’t be Hollywood sexy. But it will lead to creative professionals being more multi-disciplinary, require less technical training to do their jobs, and having the ability to deploy sophisticated creative production with less need for human collaboration.

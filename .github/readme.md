# Automators Podcast (Obsidian Vault)

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="https://relayfm.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/broadcast/image_2x/44/automators_artwork.png">
Welcome to the GitHub repository for an Obsidian vault dedicated to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators">the Automators podcast</a> from <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a>.  The aim is to provide a resource to complement the episodes and help you find further sources of information, connections between episodes, and discover the wonderful world of automation through the Automators podcast. The vault consists of hundreds of linked Markdown files covering the episodes, technology, organisations, people, and approaches.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please note this repository is **not** produced by the Automators podcast or Relay FM. The content, brand, etc. of those podcasts remains the property of those creators and this resource is intended as a resource to support listeners (and hosts) of the podcast.

## Introduction

This repository contains a wealth of information primarily in Markdown format that are structured for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

The vault contains pages for each of the podcast episodes that include details about the episode, the show notes, and a transcription.  The episode notes have been enhanced to include links (Obsidian's intra-note links) to additional details such as hosts, guests, apps, automations, concepts, methodologies, organisations, etc. This Obsidian vault is much more than a set of episode transcriptions, and makes both easy to explore and an excellent reference for anyone interested in the automation topics covered in the podcast.

> [!TIP]
> While an Obsidian vault is primarily just a collection of Markdown files and you can download and use the content of this repository with any applications that support Markdown, we would recommend using Obsidian and the plugins included in the configuration for the best experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This vault is a work in progress and while the core content around episodes is in place, and a lot more besides, there is still a lot of work to build up the additional content to support the episodes. Please be patient while the backlog is addressed.
